0,Meditation Challenge November 2022 üßòüèº," Hi all!

Why not set the intention and join me in a daily meditation challenge for November 2022? A great way to make meditation a habit in your life!

We set up a monthly meditation challenge for some time, and it's really seemed to strike a chord here and received lots of engagement and positive feedback over that time. It provided a lovely sense of community and lots of encouragement.

**So, here's the deal:**

You choose how much time you want to spend meditating each day, and what sort of meditation you're going to practice. But you commit to practicing every day for the month of November, and maybe check in on here with others who are doing the same. The idea is to have some group support/accountability, to help you stick to daily practice all month long.

If it goes well, then we rinse and repeat for the month of December, I'll make a new post for that when the time comes.

Post a comment below if you'd like to take part. And if you'd like an accountability partner to really help see you through your daily practice, post a comment below that says ""accountability partner needed"". Then wait for someone else to reply to your comment, and say ""I'll be your partner"". You can help keep each other in check throughout the month.

For those who use it, join our accountability group on Discord! [https://discord.gg/meditationmind](https://discord.gg/meditationmind)

Good luck folks. Hope this helps some of you start a meditation habit and others get back into one.

**TLDR:** Encouragement and support for people trying to make daily meditation stick!

**NOTE:** I like to encourage everyone who wants to take part and who leaves a comment below by wishing them luck and other little things in response. But I don't reply to people who have asked for an accountability partner in their comment because I don't want them to get a little ""new message"" icon and get hopeful only to find it's me saying ""good luck!"", and also because I think people scanning comments to see if anyone needs a partner might more easily look past those that already have a reply, even if the reply is just from me and isn't actually an offer to be a partner. Just wanted to let those folks who don't get a reply from me know that it's nothing personal! I wish you luck too, and am pleased you're taking part! :)

**NOTE 2:** Since starting these monthly challenges, the Discord has grown to 1000+ members! So join in and help make meditation a regular part of your life!",ykyjoo,24,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/ykyjoo/meditation_challenge_november_2022/,meditation
1,Deep identity realization about my sexuality and how growing up I learned it‚Äôs bad to be gay or different. It clicked in my brain that there‚Äôs no reason to be afraid.

2,Advanced Meditation Course,"I've been meditating for over 8 years. I'm looking for an online meditation course that actually makes a shift in your brain. A type of meditation that makes you feel like you're floating after you finish. 

I've had multiple experiences when I felt that everything was truly perfect after some meditation sessions. But usually, nothing happens. I just sit for 10min and that's it.

3,Monkey Mind as a force with varying intensity?,"I'm a beginner and still figuring stuff out. Until now, I've always thought of the Monkey Mind as something that's just there, and how well I can tame it depends more or less entirely on myself: what my skill level is, how present I am, how well I'm using tricks and techniques, etc.

I now had a thought, during my meditation session of course, that the Monkey Mind might be a variable that isn't constant, that it's different every time, sometimes stronger, sometimes weaker. So if I'm able to tame it well one day and not so well the next day doesn't mean that I did worse, it could just mean that the Monkey Mind was stronger that day. 

I'm also writing this because it's been really hard to focus on the meditation object for me lately but now I'm thinking maybe it's not entirely my fault, maybe the monkey is just wilder than it was before.

To the more experienced meditators: Am I making sense? How do you think about this? Do you have any inputs or insights for me?",z3ch5k,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/z3ch5k/monkey_mind_as_a_force_with_varying_intensity/,meditation

8,Being okay with my thoughts during meditation.,"I found that it's way easier if you don't think of your thoughts as a distraction or something negative that *keeps* you from meditating. 

They're actually part of meditating. So if I focus f.e. on my breath and after a while I find myself thinking, I'm just aware that I'm thinking and go back to focusing on my breath. Easy as that.

The key is continuity and not giving up. Phases of focusing will get longer by time.

10,Amazing Twitter thread full of wisdom by a person who meditated with a master for 15hrs/day for 6 months,"[This thread](https://twitter.com/corymuscara/status/1594717233334427656) was posted on 21 November 2022 on Twitter. Cory Muscara shared the lessons he learned from intense practice with Buddhist masters. The line about procrastination really gutted me. So many truths here, especially the one about spiritual suppression.   


Text (without photos):

I meditated 15 hours a day for 6 months straight with one of the toughest Buddhist monks on the planet.  Here's what I learned:  


This is Sayadaw U Pandita. He was notorious for his unwavering belief that enlightenment is possible in this life & his ruthless expectation that his students get there. We slept 2-5 hours/night. No reading, writing or speaking.  Lots of pain. Lots of insight. Let's get into itüì∑

1. Finding your true self is an act of love. Expressing it is an act of rebellion.  

2. A sign of growth is having more tolerance for discomfort. But it‚Äôs also having less tolerance for bullshit.  

3. Who you are is not your fault, but it is your responsibility.

4. Procrastination is the refusal or inability to be with difficult emotions.  

5. Desires that arise in agitation are more aligned with your ego. Desires that arise in stillness are more aligned with your soul.  

6. The moment before letting go is often when we grip the hardest.

7. You don‚Äôt find your ground by looking for stability. You find your ground by relaxing into instability.  

8. What you hate most in others is usually what you hate most in yourself.  

9. The biggest life hack is to become your own best friend. Everything is easier when you do.

10. The more comfortable you become in your own skin, the less you need to manufacture the world around you for comfort.  

11. An interesting thing happens when you start to like yourself. You no longer need all the things you thought you needed to be happy.

12. If you don‚Äôt train your mind to appreciate what is good,  you‚Äôll continue to look for something better in the future, even when things are great.  

13. The belief that there is some future moment more worth our presence than the one we‚Äôre in right now is why we miss our lives.

14. There is no set of conditions that leads to lasting happiness. Lasting happiness doesn‚Äôt come from conditions; it comes from learning to flow with conditions.  

15. Spend more time cultivating a mind that is not attached to material things than time spent accumulating them.

16. Sometimes we need to get out of alignment with the rest of the world to get back into alignment with ourselves.  

17. Real confidence looks like humility. You no longer need to advertise your value because it comes from a place that does not require the validation of others.

18. High pain tolerance is a double-edged sword. It‚Äôs key for self-control, but can cause us to override the pain of being out of alignment.  

19. Negative thoughts will not manifest a negative life. But unconscious negative thoughts will.  

20. To feel more joy, open to your pain.

21. Bullying yourself into enlightenment does not work. Befriending yourself is how you transcend yourself.  

22. Peak experiences are fun, but you always have to come back. Learning to appreciate ordinary moments is the key to a fulfilling life.

23. Meditation is not about feeling good. It‚Äôs about feeling what you‚Äôre feeling with good awareness. Plot twist: Eventually that makes you feel good.  

24. If you are able to watch your mind think, it means who you are is bigger than your thoughts

25. Practicing stillness is not about privileging stillness over movement. It‚Äôs about the CAPACITY to be still amidst your impulses. It‚Äôs about choice.  

26. The issue is not that we get distracted. It's that we're so distracted by distractions we don't even know we're distracted.

27. There are 3 layers to a moment: Your experience, your awareness of the experience, and your story about the experience. Be mindful of the story.  

28. Life is always happening in just one moment. That's all you're responsible for.

29. Your mind doesn‚Äôt wander. It moves toward what it finds most interesting. If you want to focus better, become more curious about what's in front of you.  

30. Life continues whether you‚Äôre paying attention to it or not. I think that is why the passage of time is scary.

31. You cannot practice non-attachment. You can only show your mind the suffering that attachment creates. When it sees this clearly, it will let go.  

32. Meditation can quickly become spiritualized suppression. Be careful not to use concentration to avoid what is uncomfortable.

33. One of the deepest forms of peace we can experience is living in integrity. You can lie to other people about who you are, but you can‚Äôt lie to your heart.  

34. Be careful not to let the noise of your mind overpower the whispers of your heart.

  
35. Monks love to fart while they meditate. The wisdom of letting go expresses itself in many forms.  

36. You can't life-hack wisdom. Do the work.

&#x200B;

Sayadaw U Pandita passed away in 2016. While I often resisted his style of teaching, I had the deepest respect for him. Through his teachings, my life changed in ways I can't describe; a sentiment echoed by thousands of others. I am forever grateful.

11,Who‚Äôs That Meditating Under the Goal Post? Michigan‚Äôs Quarterback,"TLDR: J.J. McCarthy, Michigan‚Äôs 19-year-old quarterback, practices twice a day without moving a muscle. His calm could be pivotal in Saturday‚Äôs battle of unbeaten teams at Ohio State.

\----

His position requires a keen eye and snap decisions to dodge brutal collisions. But as part of his preparation for it, J.J. McCarthy swears by sitting motionless, breathing slowly, his eyes closed.

McCarthy, Michigan‚Äôs 19-year-old quarterback, has meditated daily for years. He does it in private, and he does it cross-legged before kickoff on game day, when [he said meditation helps him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAptXVSwGiA) become ‚Äúcompletely there, completely present.‚Äù¬†

McCarthy‚Äôs ability to perform under pressure could be the key to Saturday‚Äôs showdown between two undefeated teams, the No. 3 Wolverines and No. 2 Ohio State‚Äîa game whose outcome could smooth one team‚Äôs path to the College Football Playoff.¬†

The importance of McCarthy to Michigan‚Äôs offense surged last week after running back Blake Corum, a Heisman Trophy candidate, went down with a knee injury late in the first half of the Wolverines‚Äô narrow win over Illinois. Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh said Corum‚Äôs knee was ‚Äústructurally good‚Äù but didn‚Äôt say whether he would play against Ohio State.¬†

McCarthy‚Äôs skill and promise were so apparent that early this season he won the starting job from Cade McNamara, who led the Wolverines to the [Big Ten title and the playoff last season](https://www.wsj.com/articles/college-football-playoff-michigan-wolverines-11638768433?mod=article_inline). But McCarthy has struggled in recent games, and McNamara is out following knee surgery, leaving Michigan with no experienced backup.

A partial [list by the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/meditation/in-depth/meditation/art-20045858) of meditation‚Äôs benefits shows how it could help a quarterback manage an offense while defensive linemen try to clobber him: gaining a new perspective on stressful situations, increasing self-awareness and reducing negative emotions.

‚ÄúI wake up, I‚Äôll meditate for 30 minutes,‚Äù McCarthy said earlier this season. ‚ÄúAnd then, as everyone sees, [out by the field goal post,](https://twitter.com/CFBONFOX/status/1573680570911129605?s=20&t=nX_4ihm56sNAIujfUU0K8w) meditate for 10 more minutes, just as that quick tuneup to really make sure that I‚Äôm completely present in the moment.‚Äù

Although he hasn‚Äôt spoken with McCarthy, Deepak Chopra wrote in an email to The Wall Street Journal of the practice‚Äôs advantage for athletes.

‚ÄúMeditation allows them to have a quiet mind in the midst of dynamic activity,‚Äù wrote Chopra, the wellness and [integrated-medicine expert](https://www.wsj.com/video/series/how-to/how-to-meditate-at-your-desk-with-deepak-chopra/D25683CC-4F50-4B61-A5D1-F7351B93B5E6?mod=article_inline).¬†

McCarthy‚Äôs easy grin and Instagram quotes from the Persian poet Rumi and the Buddha make him seem as if he levitated to Ann Arbor from California. On Tuesday he even paraphrased a Chinese proverb: ‚ÄúBetter to be a warrior in a garden than a gardener in a war.‚Äù

But McCarthy started meditating outside Chicago, in his hometown of La Grange Park, Ill. He played high-school football at Nazareth Academy, where football coach Tim Racki and team doctor Tom Nelson have led players in meditation for years.

‚ÄúTo connect it more to these macho football players, I call it ‚Äòtactical breathing,‚Äô‚Äù Racki said.¬†

Guiding players to pause, clear their minds and breathe before practices helps bring focus to ‚Äúa bunch of teenage minds that are wandering all over the place,‚Äù Racki said. Before games, Racki gathers players in the school‚Äôs theater for about 20 minutes of meditation and visualization exercises. Some players sit in theater chairs. Others, like McCarthy did, lie on the stage or the floor.¬†

McCarthy, one of the nation‚Äôs most sought-after recruits, became known for his positivity and lightness. When he signed autographs for the fans who mobbed him on Friday nights, he included a smiley face. But when the pandemic and its shutdowns hit, McCarthy faced a heavy decision.¬†

Illinois suspended high-school football in 2020, McCarthy‚Äôs senior season. Rather than sit idle, he moved away from friends and family to IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla. There, his meditation practice deepened.¬†

‚ÄúHe would sit down, every practice, by himself and start really taking his surroundings in,‚Äù said Bobby Acosta, McCarthy‚Äôs coach at IMG.¬†

Acosta would give McCarthy his game sheet listing the plays, and McCarthy would take to an empty practice field with just that sheet‚Äîno teammates, no ball‚Äîand go through an exercise. He would memorize the first six plays, close his eyes, and step through each play in sequence. Then he‚Äôd glance at the next six plays, close his eyes, and do it again.

‚ÄúHe would go from the left hash to the right hash and play the game in his brain,‚Äù said Acosta, who recalled watching McCarthy through his office window. ‚ÄúIt looked like a dance.‚Äù

McCarthy isn‚Äôt the first athlete to meditate‚Äîthe practice is thousands of years old‚Äîbut he is among the most public about it.

‚ÄúThe Venn diagram of people who are really excited about meditation and then the other side, of people who are really excited about college athletics, doesn‚Äôt have a lot of crossover,‚Äù said Chad McGehee, a former college soccer player who became the first director of meditation training in major college sports when he joined Wisconsin athletics in March 2020.¬†

Years earlier, McGehee had helped former Badgers and NFL linebacker Chris Borland launch a pilot program for teaching mindfulness to more than a dozen former NFL players.¬†

McGehee works with a range of Wisconsin teams, including football, often leading 10-15 minutes of group meditation after weightlifting sessions. He‚Äôs worked on two manuscripts, recently submitted to academic journals, on the effects of meditation training on Wisconsin athletes.

‚ÄúNo athlete would ever take the field of competition without training their body,‚Äù McGehee said. ‚ÄúYet all the time, they take the field of the competition without training their mind. They just kind of hope that it works out.¬†

‚ÄúAnd so what J.J. is doing, and lots of athletes around here are doing, is they understand that if they expect certain qualities of mind to show up in the midst of competition, well, then they need to train for them in the same way that if they expect certain physical things to show up in competition.‚Äù

McCarthy began the season by dominating mostly weaker competition, but has completed just half of his pass attempts in the past three games. After McCarthy made a fourth-down pass against Illinois to help set up Jake Moody‚Äôs game-winning field goal, Harbaugh compared the quarterback to a former tennis champion, calling him, ‚Äúthe iceman, like Bjorn Borg.‚Äù

Harbaugh is just the latest coach impressed by McCarthy‚Äôs serenity. At IMG, where McCarthy often meditated in his dorm room to help him wind down and fall asleep, he was the one calming the coach‚Äôs fretfulness, not the other way around.¬†

‚ÄúThere was such a peace to him,‚Äù Acosta said. ‚ÄúLike, I would get nervous before a game, and he‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòCoach, Smile.‚Äô‚Äù

13,Surrendering to The Spontanious Current,"""Desire for a state leads to a compulsive ritual which we perform mechanically in order to gain that state, because it has worked in the past, for ourselves or another. But this compulsive behavior never itself really provides what was sought after; its success was accidental and temporary. There is a spontaneous current which lies underneath, which is the true path to be followed toward all satisfaction. 

This path cannot be formalized, made into any kind of all-encompassing rule, its effects cannot be replicated and repeated as a way to reach back into the cause. It is as spontaneous as unfolding creation itself, and any attempt to formalize this spontaneity ultimately fails us and misses the point entirely. This spontaneity can only be hinted at, but never spoken, found but never uncovered, lost like a coin in the river only to be discovered once again. It is here, now, as unconditional as love itself.""",z3avjz,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/z3avjz/surrendering_to_the_spontanious_current/,meditation

Who always wanted to know what's on my mind. I don't know what it is. Is it external validation or me showing them the updated version of myself and showing that i am better than I used to be.

I summed it up as a nightmare. At this time I was meditating daily and about about 2 weeks after this incident I went to a meditation center, I reached a very deep state where I believe dmt was naturally released.  I say this because during this meditation a visual of 4 aliens with preying hands grew out of a group of mushrooms, I took it as an apology for them trying to drag me off my bed.  During this time in my life I had over a year of sobriety under my belt as well.  If anyone else has had interesting experiences regarding meditation I'd love to hear about them.

23,it's ok if i meditate controlling my breathing?,"  Hi everyone, I recently started meditating (about a month) and it has been great multiple benefits but the most important one anxiety control (went from controlling my anxiety with 4 grams of weed a day to just sit and meditate). I started reading the mind illuminated to be a little more guided and also saw the faq on this sub, but I realized they both recommend to not control the breath, just try to breathe naturally and try to pay attention to it.

Well, I tried that, and it's 3 times harder for me, I can't barely feel or hear my breath (probably numbness from my anxiety i don't know) and I mind wandering a LOT more that just controlling my breath. Also my breath rhythm is really fast, so it's also not very anxiety friendly to me.

My question is if I should just keep controlling my breath (about a rhythm of 6 breaths cycles for minute) or i should try harder to enjoy and pay attention to my natural breath rhythm. i say this because i know controlling it helps me a lot more with anxiety (short term) but i don't know if in the long run i will reach a dead end and see no progress at all, because i also want to improve my concentration and other more advance topics.

25,Is there a specific reason why I should make meditation a daily practice?,"If you want to live a better, more stress-free life, regular meditation practice is crucial.

Meditation can help you cultivate a more loving and compassionate character by training your mind to focus on the present moment. It's a straightforward method for beginning to recognize the impact your inner state has on the world around you.

Concentration is a skill that can be honed through meditation practice. Meditation is beneficial for developing both self-awareness and self-esteem. Staying present via regular meditation practice is an excellent way to gain insight into oneself and the world around you.

One other benefit of meditation is the increased calm and decreased anxiety it induces. If you're in better spirits throughout the day, you'll have an easier time winding down and sleeping soundly at night.

Meditating regularly has been shown to have positive effects on one's mood.

It will become simpler the more you practice.

The second benefit is that you'll be able to keep your calm and tranquility all day long.

Third, you'll be able to recognize when your mind has wandered and hone it back in on the subject at hand.",z2vohc,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/z2vohc/is_there_a_specific_reason_why_i_should_make/,meditation

29,Can meditation fix my messed up body? No pressure!,"Hello - this is my first time posting in this sub!

I've had a difficult 18 months. I was diagnosed with a painful nerve entrapment in my groin, causing chronic leg pain, last June. In January, I had a botched decompression surgery that made the pain 10 times worse, and in September I had a neurectomy (where they cut the nerve) which was hopefully not botched, but I am still very much healing from. 

Prior to this, I was extremely fit, strong and active. I weight trained five days a week, ran, cycled and walked pretty much everywhere within a one-hour radius (I don't drive!).   


Obviously, all of that has gone out of the window. I am deconditioned and weak, not to mention not feeling my best mentally. 

The result of everything I've been through is that my body is a messed up. I'm being kind and patient with the surgery recovery itself, but the knock on effects have been unprecedented. I have unbearable tension in my neck, back, hips, hamstrings, adductors and abdominals. Some of this I am working through physically (a daily neck yoga sequence in a chair has helped the neck tension like 80 per cent).  


But a lot of the rest of the tension in my body I can't really deal with as I'm not able to exercise or stretch much yet (bit of walking, and physio to strengthen lower body so far).   


I am interested to know if meditation can be used to reduce physical tension/trauma that is held in the body. I feel like my nervous system has been in overdrive for so long, that every part of my body is just screaming NO at me, all day, every day, and I need to incorporate things into my life to slowly relax my body before I can get back to using activity as my stress reliever.   


TIA

31,Is my fear of mindful meditation justified?,"What I'm referring to might not even be mindful meditation but I read a book about training mindfulness to the point where you are mindful every second you're awake.

You start by repeating a mantra or doing something that reminds you to be mindful every 10 minutes until you eventually get to a point where you don't need it anymore and are just mindful at all moments.

Isn't this kinda scary? Can't you get to a point where you literally are incapable of not being mindful and even if you tried to stop being mindful you couldn't because your brain was thinking about that mantra that you tried so hard to remember at all moments. Like you would wake up hoping that you could just be normal and not perfectly mindful but even when you try to forget the mantra you can't.

Like that game where you try to force yourself to not think about a penguin but you can't because it's always in your mind.

52,My personal guide to help me sleep better,"Now this works for me - I hope this helps others as well.

Usually, when I wake up, either of the 3 things happens:

**#1) Wake up super fresh**

**#2) Body/brain tired but not groggy**

**#3) Groggy/Irritable/Brain fogged**

&#x200B;

**#1** & **#2** are when I am okay with myself and act like a normal being. **#1** is when I feel super focused, happy & able to meditate with a good mind as well.

**#3** is when I do not feel like doing anything throughout the day - even though I have slept for 8/9 hours+. Very irritated by small things and just wanna be in my own zone - I am sure a lot of the people lurking here go through this.

&#x200B;

So I deconstructed and analyzed how was I able to reach these different # wake-up points.

**#1) Wake up super fresh: Early sleep + light mind**  
This happens to me when I am able to **sleep early** (10-11 PM) with a **very light mind,** which means no train of thought or overthinking going through my brain.  

I usually meditate and then after a few minutes transition to sleep (not sure if this is the correct way).

**#2) Body/brain tired but not groggy: Late sleep + light mind**

This happens to me when I am not able to sleep early but my mind is not going through any train of thought or constantly jumping around. 

**#3) Groggy/Irritable/Brain fogged: Late sleep + heavy mind**

Now, this is the crucial one -  most of the time, I go into endless late-night scrolling/Netflix binging - which is fine, but along with this comes an endless train of thought about what could have been and what could be.

I would replay most of the scenarios in my head while laying in my bed not moving a single inch for an hour or a couple of hours.   
I would go to bed at 11 but just lie down and overthink, crowding my brain until 2. 

This does 2 things:  
1) Overstimulation of the brain, which ultimately makes you more tired

2) Transitioning into sleep with a heavy mind - which, for me, does not guarantee a good quality of sleep.

&#x200B;

Every night I am focusing on getting a sleep that makes my morning **#1** \- turning my brain off by 9/10 and meditating for 20-30 minutes so that when I sleep, my mind is super light & trying not to binge or endlessly go on a doomscroll.

Sure on weekends, I stay up - because it is fun and I am not doing it every day.

&#x200B;

**TL DR;**

For me, sleeping early with a light-headed mind & meditating before sleeping has helped me a lot. I just give my brain up, meditate & sleep. 

&#x200B;

I hope this helps someone who wakes up groggily every day. I also suggest noting down for a week, what you are doing right before sleeping and how you feel the following morning.",z1zrhq,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/z1zrhq/my_personal_guide_to_help_me_sleep_better/,meditation

62,True ‚Äòsize‚Äô of my emotions,"I‚Äôm not entirely sure how else to describe it, but recently I‚Äôve been thinking about how meditation allows me see the true ‚Äòsize‚Äô of my emotions.

It‚Äôs funny. You see, for the longest time I‚Äôve romanticised my emotions and make them seem grander than they actually are. For example, I try to be sadder to process my sadness more efficiently(?) or at the very least see it more clearly, I amplify my worries to really show people (or myself) that I truly care about something, and I try to savour and hold onto moments of joy and happiness, making them last longer than they should. Let‚Äôs imagine emotions as food: with the first two examples, I feel like I‚Äôm overseasoning my food to, at the very least, taste something and with the last example, I feel like I‚Äôm leaving food in my mouth for far too long to the point where it no longer tastes of anything. 

A part of me thinks that the reason I try to amplify these emotions and make them last longer than they should is because doing so makes me ‚Äòsee‚Äô them more clearly and the longer duration gives me more time to feel them. Going back to the food metaphor again, it‚Äôs almost as though salty food needs to be saltier for me to taste it in the same way my joy, sadness and hurt need to be more joyful, sad and hurtful for them to be seen and felt. 

With meditation, however, I don‚Äôt need to overseason my emotions. There are no theatrics, no extra embellishments, they simple are just that. It‚Äôs refreshing to see the true ‚Äòsize‚Äô (taste?) of my emotions. In a way, it‚Äôs like how mindfully eating makes you appreciate subtle flavours.

What about you? Do you feel the same? Do you overseason your emotions (or food)?

64,I saw colors and a rainbow,"Yesterday, I decided to switch up my meditation. I am not religious but I decided I was going to focus on asking ""God"" for forgiveness and love. So I did that for about 40 minutes while I was barefoot at a park. I was also maintaining a 4-7-8 diaphragmatic breath. At some point in the center of focus, all these colors like blue, purple, yellow, and green were in my vision, some of them coming at the same time. Then I continued to focus and created a rainbow (not a bow) of colors only for a few seconds. I was doing seated meditation on a bench. I have done almost all Hemisync (I haven't done all of wave 8) and while I was meditating, I was doing focus 10. I am going to attempt all of this again today. I wonder what part of my meditation (or all of it) led me to seeing colors.",z1uu66,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/z1uu66/i_saw_colors_and_a_rainbow/,meditation
65,The Fallout on the Way out.,"  

The third stage of meditation experienced many, many times, has a big effect on your life, as you might imagine. I consider it the ""tipping point"" because if you get to this stage you will keep practicing for the rest of your life. There's no going back. What could compete with it?

Also, your tastes will start to change in a big way. Enjoyments and interests that you used to go after will start seeming less interesting, less pleasurable, and also bound up with all sorts of hassles--people say this of depression, too, but you will know that you are not depressed. You're happier than before. You've just got something more interesting, and more pleasurable than the old standbys, which have become unmasked, exposed as poor alternatives to well-being, as counterfeits.

You will start reorienting your life towards developing the practise further. You will start simplifying to make more space in your life for practice. You will start to let go of other interests, mainly those that seem to get in the way, and also those that just take up space in your life but don't really give you much by comparison. It helps to have fewer monkeys on your cart.

In my case, I was a moderately talented musician. I could play some Bach on the piano, I could play Bach lute suites and a handful of different styles of music on the guitar. But it took a lot of effort, involved a lot of practise and struggle to maintain my skills, and didn't give me adequate payback. So I just let it go, not because it was bad, but because it wasn't as interesting, and it was taking energy away from something that I found far more life-giving. A few people in my life said things like ""I'd give my left arm to be able to play like that,"" and perhaps they thought I was crazy. Not just musicianship, but music in general became far less interesting. The reason is that once you taste the sweet relief and pleasure associated with a quiet, still, blissful mind, you will want to try to maintain that. And music has a way of taking on a life all its own in your life and in your head. As a meditator, I'm trying to cultivate a quiet, still, mindfulness, but people who are musical often experience what are called ""ear worms."" Hours after you stop playing music, on the piano, or on the stereo, certain melodies can just go on repeating over and over in your head. In my case, this can go on for days, even a week or a little bit more. It's no better than the mind nattering away to itself. It obliterates the silence within.

My friend Michael is also a long-term meditator. We compare experiences. Our experiences are very, very similar. He did the art work for the front page on this web site and also for the picture on the ""Wheel of the Mind"" post. He did them for me  years ago. He has trained as a designer. Obviously he's very talented. But he, too, after years of meditation eventually just gave it up the art. For years it wasn't working for him anymore. He finally pulled the pin. I won't ask him for any more drawings; he's moved on. His art supplies just sit on a shelf. It's dead. 

Some of you might be thinking: ""That's so sad."" No it's not. He's got better things to do now. Doing art is simply less interesting, less pleasurable, and also fraught with downsides. As a meditator he has become connoisseur of mind states, very sensitive to even subtle movements in the heart/mind, and he tells me that he detects a lot of anxiety associated with the creative process. And an art project devours his attention and it is difficult to shut off. Both of those things obliterate mindfulness. Art had to go. He knows what it is like to be a skilled artist; he knows what it is like to be a skilled meditator. He knows *both* sides. So he is in the best position to determine what is what. And in the end he decided on happiness. What could be more important?

These two examples above might seem extreme to some readers. Why can't you do both? Well, of course we can. But why would we want to do both, when one pales by comparison with the other. We're more interested in feeling really good. This movement in the direction of abandoning interests is very, very common as one tastes the superiority of the contemplative life. 

Another challenge resulting from gaining access to deep meditation is social. If you get access to what I call the third stage, in some ways you're going to be more alone now, So few people have access to this movement in the heart/mind, a movement which will have become central to your life. In the same way that deployed infantry soldiers say that only another brother in arms can really understand your experience, your non-meditator friends won't be able to really ""get you"" anymore. And as a consequence you won't be able to fully share this most intimate aspect of your life with. And they will want to go out and do the things you all did before, go to events that are exciting and energizing, but you're now headed the other way. You'll have a greater need for solitude, quiet, and stillness. You'll probably lose a lot of friends. And you'll gain far fewer back--those very few who can do what you can do, and a few others who can't but who are interested and on the way. None of this will deter you. You *are* being admirably compensated for the resultant social upheaval by having an enchanting ""place"" you can get to which is so life-giving and so promising of more to come. You will probably double down on your practice. You will seek out companionship with those who are also on the way. You will know that the practice is the only thing that really makes sense  anymore and that it's the best thing you can do. Again, this must seem so extreme to some readers, but this is very, very common for those who go this way.

I go to a Buddhist monastery from time to time for retreats. I almost always get an interview with the abbot. I like to check-in with him and get pointers because he is such a knowledgeable and experienced practitioner. By the way, many years ago he, too, walked away from a conventional life as a married, professional performer of classical music and before too long ordained as a Buddhist monk. He's more than thirty years ""in the robes"" now.  Just before covid hit, I went on a retreat at his monastery and I got an interview with him. I informed him that this third stage, as I call it, had been happening to me then for about four years (at that point), and over that period this euphoria had been arising more and more consistently in my sittings, and that now it was coming up almost every time I sat. In essence he told me: ""This is called rapture. It is one of the jhana factors, and also one of the seven enlightenment factors. RIght Effort requires you to maintain it, to develop it further, and to perfect it. That is, You need to make it happen *all* of the time."" *That* took me back.

""You mean, *every* time I sit?""

""No. All of the time.""

""Even off the cushion""?

""All of the time."" 

I was baffled by that, because the rapture was thus far connected only with my actual sitting practice. The path factor of Right Effort involves preventing and abandoning unskillful states, and bringing into existence and maintaining and perfecting skillful states. The quintessential skillful states are the seven so-called enlightenment factors. And rapture is indeed one of them.

It's been some years since he told me that, and I've come to realize that he was right. I *can* tap into the rapture even off the cushion. I'm not saying that it is as intense as while sitting. And I'm not saying that I can maintain it constantly. But I am saying that it is there. It is available. And, most importantly, moving through life just seems so much easier, so much better with it as a companion. And learning to keep it on all the time has become a central part of the practice for me. I'm much happier now, even though I have given up music, have given up all sorts of popular entertainment, and have let go of many friendships. To me, I made the right choice. I chose happiness. I chose well-being.

This is an example of how meditation overflows the actual sitting practice and starts welling up in your life. I think this is the heart of Buddhism, If it doesn't improve your emotional life than it's not of much value. But in my experience the practice does indeed confer a growing sense of freedom, freedom from irritation, freedom from sadness, freedom from anxiety, freedom from fear, freedom from suffering. That's the good news.

But, if you go this way, there's going to be a lot of fallout. How could it not be the case? Just though you should know. To be fair. So that you won't be shocked. There will be a transition period. But you will never regret it.

67,Help me make this better if you have any ideas or knowledge. Otherwise this is a good 101 on meditation.,"Resisting emotions, thoughts and physical sensations makes them persist and increase in severity. Don't try to resist, just focus on feeling. The stronger the focus and the longer you do it for, the deeper the benefits... but if you do it correctly even 5 minutes is enough.

Ask yourself if you're resisting anything to pull yourself back to just feeling. Most common mistake is wondering and worrying if you're doing it right at the same time while meditating. Thus only ask if you were successful after the session. While meditating let go of control, just feel. Trust that it'll work.

Signs you've done it correctly is blissfulness, boost to motivation, loss of negative emotions such as anxiety, anger and fear of death.

71,Meditation inspired question: Why is time moving faster as I get older?,"In my \~6 years as a meditator I‚Äôve come more and more aware of the seemingly accelerating passage of time. 

Apparently, this isn‚Äôt a new observation. I‚Äôve come across authors, thinkers, researchers etc. who have explored why it is that time seems to move by faster as we age. 

In this post I‚Äôll share the two most insightful explanations I‚Äôve found...

**The Relative Proportion Perspective** 

This perspective on why time seems to speed up with age isn‚Äôt so much of a theory as just mathematical thought. 

One year for say, a ten year old, represents 10% of life and maybe 20% of conscious memory. One year for someone who is 50 represents 2% of life. Every year older we get, each unit of time becomes a relatively smaller proportion. One year for a 100 year old is only 1%. 

So based on this perspective it makes sense that each additional year (or month or week etc) ‚Äúfeels like‚Äù less. It‚Äôs like adding a penny to our hands. The first few are noticeable, but if we already have two handfuls of pennies and add one more it doesn‚Äôt register quite as much. 

**The Perception Processing Speed Perspective**

This perspective starts with the ‚Äúneural pacemaking theory‚Äù. 

This theory recognizes that as children we have a higher rate of respiration and faster heartbeat. Perhaps in the way we have this cardiovascular pacemaker ‚Äì there is a corresponding cognitive pacemaker that regulates the perception of the passing of time. 

Professor Adrian Bejan expands on this theory: he hypothesizes that with age the rate at which we process visual information slows down and this makes time ‚Äúspeed up‚Äù as we grow older.

This is because memory (especially visual memory) works sort of like a movie. Think of frames per second ‚Äì the more frames per second one sees the slower the image appears to pass. A *slow motion* clip is the same clip with *more* frames *per* second than regular speed. A *fast forward* clip is the same clip with *fewer* frames *per* second than regular speed. 

So if our processing of visual information slows down with age, we are capturing fewer frames per second than when we were young. It‚Äôs as if when young we‚Äôre watching memories at .8X speed and when we‚Äôre old we‚Äôre watching at 1.2X speed. Those figures are random and meant to serve as examples, but the pattern remains. 

I‚Äôd wager both of these ‚Äì and likely additional cognitive and environmental factors ‚Äì play into this sensation of time speeding up with age. 

I hope you other meditators find this interesting!

75,The small thing law of attraction," I've actually experienced a number of different laws of attraction. Now I'm running towards a bigger goal, but these experiences have helped to dispel my doubts.  
I was going around looking at a house. I went to a house, and the house had good sunlight, good ventilation, and a spare space for exercise. I went to the real estate and looked into that house because it seemed nice to live in. But the real estate agency said just a week ago that a man signed the house and signed a two-year contract.  
The house I lived in was a small house with a bed and a desk in one room. It was a place with little sunshine and a little humid. In Korea, young people usually have only a small room to live alone. The house I visited has been in my head since some time ago. I wanted to live there. There was a living room and a room, a veranda, and although it was not big, it was a place where many bright thoughts came to mind.  
We usually have various thoughts before we go to bed. My thoughts were thoughts about the house I wanted to live in. I just imagined how to arrange the bed, where to put the desk and closet, how to grow flowers, and what kind of exercise equipment to put in the spare space if I lived in the house. It wasn't hard. I just imagined it. Even if I didn't necessarily go to the house, the house I have now was good enough and provided a good place for me to think alone. I just imagined working on the structure and desk I arranged in the house before going to sleep and resting if I had a hard time. It felt good. Then I fell asleep.  
As I said at first, the house now has a new person signing a two-year contract a week ago, but suddenly I got a call two weeks later. The man who signed the contract a week ago said he could sign the house because he canceled the contract in a hurry. The man said he had terminated the house contract with a penalty. I don't know any further reasons.  
What I did was just lie in bed and fall asleep pleasantly, thinking about how to arrange and live in a new house in quite detail. And the life of the moment I imagined was living satisfactorily. There are many factors, but the basic laws of attraction seem to have all been established.  
I was grateful for my present life, and I imagined it and felt like it actually became that life. My current law of attraction allows me to dream bigger because of this precious experience.

85,FAQ: What time of day should I meditate?,"A: The time that works best for you.

Time is one of the elements of meditation that a lot of people struggle with in hopes that they can optimize their session. The truth is, the best time to meditate is whenever you can and ideally a time that allows you to do it regularly.

A benefit to meditating in the morning is like any other habit; getting it done as early in your day as possible prevents other obligations from getting in the way. On the other hand, meditating at night gives you an opportunity to unwind and calm the mind and body before bed.

One great piece of advice I first heard from Andy Puddicombe (founder of Headspace) is to couple your meditation practice with another activity or habit you already have. For instance, taking time before or after your workout or adding meditation to your-wind down routine before bed will make it easier to fit meditation in to your busy day.

Clearly meditation can impact your day differently in small ways depending on the time but overall to ensure that you actually make it to the cushion (bed, floor, chair, etc.), find a time that works best for you and your schedule.

As I exhale, I sink into relaxation. After I go down as far as I can go, I stop and think of the here and now (present moment) as I inhale. When I exhale, I just let myself become part of the present moment. One with the present moment I guess you can think of it as.

90,What exactly am I doing?,"I started meditating about 18 months ago. I used it as an escape or relaxation mechanism for a mind that never quits. At first, I used chants from Plum Village as a focus mechanism. I learned to block out all thoughts and let my mind wander naturally through an empty void. 

Most of my sessions were 15-25 minutes long 4-5 days a week. Recently, I switched to binaural beats and varying frequency music/tones while meditating. My sessions last from 25 to 60 minutes two or three times a day now. 

I almost instantly travel now. Like I'm riding on a mining cart through space. Most times I end up at a large but empty pavilion complete with huge Roman pillars and architecture. There is a rainbow of colors everywhere. It is dimly lit and the only entities I can remember are druid or monk like beings walking in the shadows around me. There are flashes of other visions and scenarios but never any real communication. A few erotic moments with a deceased former lover.

I frequently see a bright light emanating from the top of my mind after 30 minutes or so. This is usually preceded by flashing patterns of purple, blue or violet. When I finish meditating I feel almost orgasmic now. My health seems to be improving, both mental and physical.

Is this meditation or escapism? I'm beginning to prefer the process to being conscious. Almost like an addict. I am so at peace but the minute I withdraw reality hits me like a tidal flood and the emotions elicited by the world are prevalent again.

Is this just freestyle meditation or relaxation? Is there a name for it?",z1256z,2,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/z1256z/what_exactly_am_i_doing/,meditation
91,an incredibly miraculous way to test trust in universe,"You probably need to be tuned in to yourself to a certain degree in order to even attempt this butt.....
When you go to sleep tonight...
Think about what time you want to be up tomorrow.
Whatever this looks for you, just be sincere about it and tell your unconscious that you need to wake up at ""X"" time.
Tell your unconscious that it is responsible for waking you up at so and so time.
In fact, you should make it super specific if you have that luxury.
And then don't set any alarm clocks!
Don't have anybody or anything wake you up other than your unconscious.. having gone to bed with trust that you will wake at that time when you need to.

Only issue is, if you put to sleep for 12 hours you may only need 8 hours or even less.",z17473,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/z17473/an_incredibly_miraculous_way_to_test_trust_in/,meditation
92,Dont be fooled by all this colorful people. some even fool you out of love!,"remember not to be fooled by others. Others are fooling you continuously. Not only are you fooling yourself, others are also fooling you. How are the others fooling you? The whole society, culture, civilization, is a collective conspiracy. That's why no society allows rebellious people; every society requires obedience, conformity. No society allows rebellious thoughts. Why? Rebellious thoughts make people aware that the whole thing is just a game, and when people become aware that the whole thing is just a game they become dangerous, they start going beyond the society.

Society exists as a hypnotic state, and the crowd is a hypnotizing factor. You are born, but when you are born you are neither a Hindu nor a Christian, because consciousness cannot belong to any sect. Consciousness belongs to the whole, it cannot be sectarian. A child simply is, innocent of all nonsense of Hindus, Buddhists, Jainas. A child is a pure mirror. But immediately society starts working on the child -- a mould has to be given. A child is born as a freedom, but immediately society starts killing his freedom. A mould has to be given, a pattern. If you are born in a Hindu family your parents will start teaching you that you are a Hindu. Now they are creating a hypnotic state. Nobody is a Hindu -- but this child is innocent, he can be be fooled. This child is simple. He will believe the parents, that he is a Hindu -- not only a Hindu, but a brahmin, not only a brahmin, but a deshastha brahmin. Sects within sects, just like Chinese boxes -- boxes within boxes. And the more he becomes narrowed, the more he becomes a prisoner. The box goes on getting smaller and smaller. He was just like the sky when he was born. Then he became a Hindu, a smaller box; then he became a brahmin -- a smaller box; then he became a Deshastha -- an even smaller box. This goes on and on. Society goes on forcing him into smaller boxes, and then he will have to live as a Deshastha brahmin. His whole life he will be with this box. He will carry this box around him. This box is a grave. He must come out of these boxes; only then will he know what real consciousness is. 

Then society gives concepts; then society gives prejudices and systems and religions. And then he will never be able to look directly, always society will be there to interpret. You are not aware when you say something is good. Are you there, looking? Is this your feeling, that something is good, or just an interpretation of the society? Something is bad: have you looked into it and come to the conclusion that something is bad, or has society simply taught you that this is bad?",z16uoh,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/z16uoh/dont_be_fooled_by_all_this_colorful_people_some/,meditation

It's thoughts all the way down and I can never come back to the breath!

103,Meditate non medicate?,"A rather new article (rehashed over the past 15 years ago) has shown up from JAMA Psych ([https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2798510](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2798510) )  (that is the abstract.  

As a health care provider and meditation teacher I have a few points to bring up about this.  First of all so many publications have picked up on this hyping that meditation is as effective as meditation, which if you read the article and research is not true.  

I have always encouraged people to meditate and reduce medications as much as possible.  I am a chiropractor and acupucnturist by profession and meditation teacher in a Buddhist tradition that is based in Mahayana lineages.  I have worked with people with ADD, Depression, Bipolar Disorder and anxiety.  I currently teach meditation at a renowned psychiatric hospital to acute care pediatric, adult and even in the detox unit and active duty military, police, and first responder populations.     I find that meditation does indeed help them, but to say that it works as well as medication is misleading.   Meditation is a PROCESS that takes time to take effect and has to be worked on by the individual.  Medication takes far less effort, determination and followthrough than meditation does.  Look at one's own practice.  It is easy to take a pill, but can he hard to sit for an amount of time.  (in the study it mentioned 45 minutes a day) That is a great goal, hardly  achievable by most people on their own.  Especially with anxiety or depression.  

As you read the article please see the 'outcome' statement, this is an important distinction.  "" **Conclusions and Relevance**  The results from this randomized clinical trial comparing a standardized evidence-based mindfulness-based intervention with pharmacotherapy for the treatment of anxiety disorders found that MBSR was noninferior to escitalopram. ""  This mentions one medicine.  Secondly, it does say specifically that MBSR was ""noninferior"" this is far far from saying it was superior in any way.   Words and the the way they are used is very important in research and can mean far different things than the laity may realize or understand.  

So in closing, keep meditating, don't stop your meds without evaluations, keep in communication with providers and prescribers.  As you get better you WILL see a decrease in the need for many medications.  Improve your nutrition and overall health (physical, chemical, emotional, spiritual, energetic etc) and you will find that you will not need the meds, but it takes time and EFFORT.    

Good luck, and as I always say, 'don't take advice from random folks on the interwebs' educate yourself and learn WHY and how things are said.

We can definittely recognize our trash situation and also have a slight understanding that we could be living, 



together, so much more freely. 



You don't have to wait. 




There's no reason, point, meaning, need for you to wait.




Just go!





GO GOGOGOGOGOGOGOOGOGOGOG




Nothing back......




And i think cleaning the slate is important.




I think its scary to wonderrrrrrrrrrr what the mind is capable of if it is empty....




How the fuck could you know this without seeing it from someone....

You are following yourself :)

But as a colony it is able to accomplish... complex.. multilayered systems of some order or organization.



Its all a natural order that grows like vegetation.

Glad we could clear that up.



It is SAFE and FINE AND AMAZING to clear the slate....



Sadly In society we are all godammned forced to be dead.



We can plenty succeed at letting ourselves go when in private.

121,3 reasons why you feel you are failing at meditation,"Hey friends, 

A few weeks ago I have written a post on my journey through meditation for over 1000 days. Unexpectedly, the post just took off. 160k+ people read it. Which I am very grateful for.

I am glad to be able to help by writing about my own experience with meditation.

Anyway, I received hundreds of comments and DMs.

Many of them were from new meditators expressing their frustration about not being successful.

I want to list here the 5 common reasons I found in these DMs and comments on why you feel you are failing in meditating.

### 1. Inconsistency

Meditation is a compound effect type of thing.

Its effects build up the more you do it. The key thing to compound the effects of meditation is consistency. Every day you do it, you move a step forward.

Every day you miss, it‚Äôs 2 steps back. Hence, frustration.

I do not advise you to practice meditation if you are not willing to be consistent with it because it will create frustration and guilt instead of the beneficial effects it is supposed to.

Here is some advice from my own experience: **start very very small.** Meditate for 2 minutes.

But do it every day. You have your whole life to build up the duration of your meditations. Build the habit first.

### 2. Seeking the ideal meditation

A lot of people asked me what is the best length, the best technique, or the ideal frequency.

Looking for perfection won‚Äôt take you anywhere with meditation.

I did this mistake and read dozens of books and articles on the subject looking for the perfect technique. Just to discover that there is no such thing.

But I learned something; since everyone is different, no 1 technique will fit all.

Finding your meditation routine is like tuning a musical instrument. You can not do it if you don‚Äôt play with it by pulling its cords.

Trying multiple techniques through the years is what is allowing me to fine-tune my technique. I don‚Äôt think I found a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù technique for me though. Still working on it!

Here is some advice from my own experience: **Pick any technique and stick with it for a few weeks. You can either pick another one if you are uncomfortable or improve your technique to make it fit your nature.**

&#x200B;

**Here are 3 meditation techniques from the easiest to the most elaborate:**

You can practice them in a lotus/half lotus position or sitting down on a chair, back straight at 90¬∞, and palms on your lap.

If your back is hurting, it is ok to lean back on something as long as your back is straight.

**Focus your thinking on your breathing**:

* Let your breathing occur naturally. Watch it occurring eyes closed.
* Repeat mentally ‚Äúinhaling‚Äù when you inhale and ‚Äúexhaling‚Äù when you exhale.

That‚Äôs it

**Control your breath**:

* Inhale to the count of 4, hold to the count of 7, and exhale to the count of 8. Do the whole cycle 4 to 8 times.
* Then let your breath occur naturally and your thoughts and emotions run wild.
* Don‚Äôt block them but welcome them. ‚Äú Oh, I am thinking of my colleague‚Äù ‚ÄúI hate him‚Äù ‚Ä¶ Just observe, don‚Äôt engage, don‚Äôt judge, and don‚Äôt go into an argument with yourself. Once you observe, let the thought or emotion pass and go back to observing your breathing happening naturally

**Control your mind:**

* Pick a meditation subject in the form of an open question. Examples:  ‚Äú how to be more patient‚Äù or ‚Äúhow to succeed in meditating longer‚Äù
* **I**nhale to the count of 4, hold to the count of 7, and exhale to the count of 8. Do the whole cycle 4 to 8 times. Then let your breath occur naturally
* Focus your eyes (closed) at the point between your eyebrows. If you have never done this, it might help to put your finger between your eyebrows and focus on your finger then take it off
* Ask yourself your question. Observe what comes, don‚Äôt judge, and don‚Äôt nag yourself. Just observe.
* Every time you notice you have drifted from your subject, ask yourself mentally your question

### 3. Seeking short-term goal

Many of us start meditation to achieve some sort of short-term goal. Guilty here!

Most of the time we look to relieve our suffering through it.

And meditation does help in relieving suffering but not in the short term.

**Meditation is the process through which we train our brains to focus single-pointedly.**

To focus single-pointedly, we need to learn to calm our thoughts.

Most of our wild thoughts are consequences of emotions. So we need to learn to notice, define and process our emotions.

If like me you have a lot of repressed emotions, doing this work might take years. But the benefits are without compare.

This work of getting to know your thoughts and emotions and learning how to process them is helped by meditation.

Once emotions and thoughts are under control, we start to reap the benefits of meditation which is the ability to focus on nothing.

Focusing on nothing allows us to enter a state of bliss. This state, if maintained even for a few seconds, can relieve a huge load of suffering.

123,There is no such thing as meditation for me... unless?,"My physical circumstances don't allow me to meditate. Meditation doesn't exist when you go in and out of consciousness while trying to do certain tasks. (consciousness change due to repeated sleep deprivation). Anytime I try to do breathing exercises I am physically and literally limited by my space which doesn't allow me to do basic arms movements without hitting a wall or having to sit down with my legs in a position that makes me look crippled. or i have to be subjected to cold temperatures which are extremely uncomfortable (I live in Canada and the house I'm at has no heating).

Perhaps a mall chair could work or something like that but then I would get weird looks.

An suggestions apprecited. perhaps there is a certain type of meditation that can be performed under extreme circumstances and idk what that is.

125,Can I be too involved in spirituality?,"I had a moment when I was traveling in nature and since then I (at least I think I‚Äôm ) became more self-aware. 

And I‚Äôve been reading a lot. David Hawkins, Eckhart Tolle, Jon Labat Zinn, Thich Nhat Hanh, the book of the dead. 

But even if I read fiction I find the traces of ‚Äúenlightenment‚Äù (I really haven‚Äôt found the word) in everything. 

My emotional regulation has gotten much better, and my resistance to stress.

I have an addiction though, so my resilience improved a tiny little bit only.

And now I‚Äôve started to read on chakras, I went to the local Buddhist center for meditation (it‚Äôs a tiny tiny place because my country is so no Buddhist I‚Äôm surprised this place exists).

I have had many ‚Äúescape routs‚Äù in my life so I‚Äôm skeptical about my enthusiasm.

I definitely feel like I lack the community to support me when I have questions.

But I do think I have developed a conscience and I do feel like I‚Äôm growing. But reading so much and trying to get the knowledge makes me worried: what if my ego is underneath this, secretly? 

The other option is that I read so much because I‚Äôm still very much in doubt ( I believe this is why religious people I know might read the Bible a lot?)

I have many more questions I hope I‚Äôll find answers to here.

 Today while doing breath meditation i noticed this. I begin by bringing attention to breath. After a few seconds some thought pops up and my attention is now towards a thought process until i realise oh i was lost in thoughts so the attention returns to breath. This on repeat. 
The session felt very violent. The mind just kept wandering and coming back . It recognises on its own and then returns to breath.
Been meditating for 6+ months. 30 mins daily. 
I cant seem to be improving. 
Is there a way i could stabilise my attention on breath for longer durations. And quickly recognise that i have drifted away rather than taking a good minute.

130,What activity or unorthodox method has given you a powerful experience of awareness?,"I ask because I recently had a powerful experience while writing. I was writing a poem, and as I did, I stopped trying to write anything in particular, and simply waited for an image to arise. Once there was an image, no matter how mundane, I would write about it, describe it, and put it in the context of a story, trying always to delve deeper beyond the original image. The more I wrote, the more real the subject became to me. It felt the same as when you write down a dream.

After writing for a couple hours, I walked to my car in a state that was similar to an hour-long meditation, or a micro-to-mid-dose of psilocybin. I was, for once in my life, without fear, had no preferences, and felt as though I were aware of everything around and inside me, be it a tree I was walking by, or a thought that arose in my mind. I had completely ceased to identify with what was in my mind, because in that moment, I somehow \*knew\* directly that thoughts and feelings were not ""me"", that part that is simply aware.

I was not manic, ecstatic, or jumping with joy. I was simply okay with everything, and this meant more to me than any pleasure or excitement I've ever experienced. Somehow, by writing unreal, dream-like stories, I had never felt closer to reality in my entire life.

What activity or unorthodox meditation method have you used to achieve unexpectedly powerful results?

132,Question about thoughts during meditation,"Hello,

I have used mindfulness and meditation over the years for anxiety/panic attacks (and it helped a great deal). I was introduced to thinking about my breathing and focusing on the breath while meditating. 

While on Reddit, I've seen posts that talk about letting your mind think about other stuff - like your worries, anxieties, fears, etc. In essence, you let these thoughts consume you and let them play out ""like a movie"" without trying to impede or stop them. When and if they end, they end and you allow something else to present itself. 

What is this second type of meditation called? Is it still mindfulness? I'd like to learn more about it and see if it's something I should approach but I'm not sure how to find info because the vast majority of information talks about the breath and focuses on the breath.

142,a little meditation turned my thoughts to sounds,"Today I was feeling anxious for about 5 hours before remembering that it's my thoughts causing that, so I sat down to meditate and listen to what's going on in my head. I decided to use the question 'I wonder what my next thought will be' as a guiding point to return to presence, as I had heard this recommended by Echart Tolle. 

To start with, the thoughts were very negative and critical, such as 'why did I have sugar again when I said I wouldn't-that's obviously why I feel bad-why I am aching-could be gym, could be flu-why can't I change' etc etc.

Each time I had a thought (or at least as often as I could manage) I wrote it down and silently asked myself again 'what will my next thought be?'. After about 10 minutes I noticed that the thoughts stopped and turned into sounds of people saying things that I'd seen on tiktok and TV throughout the day. I couldn't tell exactly the phrases but it was more just like an echo, like background chat in a restaurant. 

I was able to just observe this and stay focused on being present for about 10 more minutes. It was an interesting experience and helped me to feel much calmer.

But this ""I"" or ""self"" is something that has never existed, does not exist, and will never exist. It's like a projection onto the five aggregates, the smell of a flower is the smell of the whole flower, not just the smell of the pistol, the leaves, the stem...

163,Why do many mediation gurus seem to be enlightened in a moment of deep despair?,"This is something I have been meaning to ask or look into but I know I have reflected that many mediation ""gurus"" (not sure what a better term would be) seem to have reached their state of enlightenment in a moment of deep despair?

I know both Eckart Tolle and Byron Katie had these moments where they almost seemed on the brink of suicide and then their insight and relief and enlightened moment came over them.

Now I was just listening to a conversation between Loch Kelly and Sam Harris and again the same thing, Loch Kelly was on the brink of giving up after the death of his father and then he had his awakening moment.

Why is this? I would assume it has something to do with truly giving up? And in that giving up something in the mind is somehow released? Or what could be the reason?

I also think I have felt something akin to this myself with some moments insights coming when at ""the bottom"", even though I would not call them awakening moments but just smaller insights.",yz8m8g,1,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yz8m8g/why_do_many_mediation_gurus_seem_to_be/,meditation
164,I really enjoy mind wandering,"In my daily life I spend a lot of time dedicated to mind wandering. I just find my thoughts very interesting to the point where I have dedicated time to just let my mind wander. I usually have thoughts around day dreaming (specifically involving ego fufillment), psycho analysing myself and other people,  and politics. 

This causes me a lot of problems throughout my life. It leads to me having less time to do other things that I think could add to my life. I struggle to focus on anything. Motivating myself to do unrewarding tasks is really diffucult as my mind keeps wandering as soon as I have a thought reminding me that I have things to do. I also have difficulties properly processing emotions because of this.

When I meditate almost all of the time is spent mind wandering as my mind always feels like its always going very fast. Should I just try not to spend time mind wandering in my daily and always bring myself to the present? What do you people reckon I do?

165,The Paradox of controlling the breath,If you‚Äôre listening to a guided meditation and they tell you not to change your breath and you begin being consciously aware of it you start to think that you‚Äôre controlling it and you attempt to seize your control of the breath which makes you control it even more.,yysvzy,10,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yysvzy/the_paradox_of_controlling_the_breath/,meditation
166,The Nature of Peace,"After four days of fasting in the Inyo mountains, our group sat in a circle and we each told what happened to us during our time alone.  

When I described the place I'd chosen for my fast‚Äîmy mountain peak, the grandmother juniper, the vast silence in all directions‚ÄîI said, several times, ""it felt like peace.""  

One of the elders mirroring my story said that when I go out into the world again, I should ask myself, ""what feels like peace?""  

These words have felt increasingly important to me lately as our world speeds up again.

It is a time of uncertainty in my life. And as a result, I feel a powerful pull toward security. But security is not the same thing as peace.

Security is about managing fear by managing risk.

Peace is about knowing there is, ultimately, nothing to fear.

Security can be a good and healthy thing. It gives us time to rest, heal, and play. It helps the children within us feel at ease. And that counts for a lot.  

Peace is something else. It is the calm knowledge that love cannot be taken from you, because you are the source of love. It is the knowledge that while all your money may be lost, your true inheritance remains untouched. It is the calm of knowing that the world does not rest on your shoulders, and that everything that is truly important will be accomplished on its own and in its own time.  

Peace is a descent. It is rooted. It is grounded. It does not rush or earnestly try to get ahead. It moves slowly and honestly. It walks in the light with a strong, steady heart, and slow, steady steps.

Instead of darting back and forth, a person at peace sits still until they know which way to go. Then they get up and walk slowly in the right direction, and in the end get there faster than those who rushed.

In this sense, peace does not mean ""non-violence,"" although that's usually the result. Rather, if violence is required‚Äîlike the killing of an animal for food‚Äîit is carried out with respect and reverence. After the deed is done, there is peace in   the soul.  

I believe this is a quality that indigenous peoples often carry. This deep-rooted peace emanates through ancient traditions and practices.  

It's no wonder that pockets of our modern society‚Äîwith its heady, rushing quality‚Äîlook with increasing admiration and longing to the peoples that have maintained their rooted nature.  

Tyson Yunkaporta writes that this indigeneity is not some special quality that particular ethnic groups or skin-colors carry in exclusion to the rest of the world.

Rather, he reminds us that we were all once indigenous. From the Celtic peoples to the ancestral Norse, from the slavic peoples to the Germanic tribes to the ancient Israelites and the animistic Berbers of the Arabian peninsula.  

This indigeneity, as Yunkapora puts it, has not been lost in ""modern"" people. It is always near the surface. These qualities emerge naturally when we slow down and connect with the land, with one another, and with the depths of our souls.

When we are at peace, the world itself goes quiet. We feel steady, like a large, old tree whose roots go deep, and whose limbs sway slowly.

Stop and ask yourself, ""what feels like peace?"" Then slowly walk in that direction. I'll meet you there.

167,Lustful thoughts stopped coming,"I am a guy. I practiced mindfulness meditation in a secular way for 3 months. I practiced 6 months of Mantra meditation earlier but for some reason it didn't work that well, maybe I made some mistake. Currently my mind is somewhat empty and less thoughts are coming as I always try my best to be aware and ignore the incoming thoughts. Depressive and anxious thoughts reduced, so did the sexual thoughts. Even after looking at attractive women I don't fantasize to engage with them like I did earlier. Even though I am not religious I actually took my desires as the cause of sufferings and ego-self / identities as my enemy, so I was very serious. Some non spiritual might consider not getting excited as a lack of manhood but I suddenly started feeling I am going to be like Buddha and it really surprised me that the progress came so fast. Of course I am no where near Buddha and lot of efforts need to be made and there's a long road ahead.

168,I want to test out my meditational techniques to substance abuse people since it might of help one.,"I have help someone with ADD, suicidal ideation, sleep, major depressive disorder and maybe maybe smoking. There is no link. Here is the technique please I hope you like it. Imaging a sphere on your abs muscles located in the middle of your abs. Pick a sensation like cold water and pick a color like blue pick a mantra like calm put it into sphere spin it forwards and then when is get cool enough shoot it to the brains center line and imaging it is going up the 2 veins into the brain. Now for the back you use a cylinder in the spinal erectors you repeat the same process except the cylinder will turn counterclockwise and you shoot not straight to your spin but two veins of the neck. for substance abuse people I know because I was kind of a substance abuser myself. I mean when I was little, I would take out the ink thing and the head of the pen. Then spray perfume in it and then smoke it that way. So, I know that drugs are very very powerful and the length it takes for people to get high because of depression but I want to change all [that.](https://that.Now) Now enough back story. overtime you can just do techniques as you walk, run and work and play is like your personal vape pen, but it is in your body.  

for the lungs you are imaging your lungs are feel with a sensation a color and a mantra and you shoot it to the brain the same way I have explain to you above. just never do pick colors.

Here is the plan

month 1

1 to 3 hours igniting the flame. Pick a mantra like accelerated happy yellow energy color yellow sensation yellow cake mix with the sun or sweet sun or find your favorite color, sensation and technique. For both back and abs.

month 2

30 minutes. Try to think cognitive techniques like super memory blue sensation, Water mental stamina red or focus flow state.

Month 4

Start working out. do increase muscular strength can be any color. Speed , lung stamina. 

if you do not want to work out skip month 4

and do more cognitive techniques and the lung techniques.

Month 6 

try to master one 3 types of the technique. Physical fitness, mental performance and mental health.

&#x200B;

Month 7-1 year.

experiment with different techniques it's not a one size fits all you might one better one over the other.

170,you're not helping anyone,"And if you were there wouldn't be any meaning/point to do it.
Nobody wants help and nobody actually wants to help. ""You can only help yourself"". You can only live your life... what we need..If anything... is to heal. Heal not help. I feel pretty confident that we are all stuck in ruts. May your gurus break you free of all your plateaus. 

So why do you want to help so bad? 
Obviously no one takes the help.

For meeeeeee. I reach out and attempt to express myself as purely as possible. And get more comfortable with letting the chips fall where they land. I'm confident that there's no need to be worried. You can be skeptical and doubt many things in life... but not this life itself ;)

In meditation, when I am alone, I am able to metaphorically ""let my hair down"" I can relax and full be myself. The issue is when I get around other people. Simply because I can only let my own hair down so far. I also need/want others to relax and let their hair down out in public too. I can only go so far in relaxing around others. I do need them for their half of the relation. Same with being self conscious. You can be around people who are so self conscious that you are constantly pulled back to having to be as self conscious as they are again. I don't want to spend my entire life of bliss being alone on my meditation mat or up in the cold caves of the mountain. I want to get out and play!

**Giving your time, listening, trying to understand and feel what someone else feels, comforting someone in need, hugging and sharing uplifting words, guiding someone to see their own worth in difficult times for that person.  This is what true love is.**

**So, if you put your time, your effort, your energy into the opposite, into the gifts and grand gestures, then you are really going the opposite direction of love.

177,A profound realization: The mind can be addicted to suffering,"For context, I am someone who has struggled with frequent bouts of depression.
Recently, I decided to meditate upon my negative feelings. I wanted to go deep, and really discover the root cause of this suffering‚Ä¶

So I went deep. I allowed myself to observe and investigate my negative emotions. I recall myself thinking: ‚Äúwhy do I feel so bad right now?‚Äù. This led to another thought: ‚Äúwhy do I feel so bad all the time ?‚Äù‚Ä¶

I came to the conclusion that there wasn‚Äôt a particular reason. Same thing when I asked myself why I felt so bad in the past. No discernible reason.

Then, an interesting concept occurred to me: 

‚ÄúMaybe, on a subconscious level, I somehow enjoy suffering‚Äù‚Ä¶

That was my epiphany. It was a perspective I had never even considered before. As I continued on observing my thoughts, things started to click. 

Upon further reflection, I realized that my mind has this profound ability to make me feel like absolute shit for no apparent reason. 

So, if these negative thoughts aren‚Äôt coming from my conscious mind, where are they coming from?

I then realized how my own mind has been programmed to subconsciously seek out suffering.

The subconscious mind has this powerful ability to confirm it‚Äôs own beliefs by subtly impacting conscious actions. This is what causes people to perform destructive behavioural patterns without realizing why.

I suddenly became acutely aware of how my own subconscious beliefs have subtly been sabotaging me. 

I came to the conclusion that the majority of my suffering can be traced back to the subconscious. I have a subconscious desire to feel bad. And I think it‚Äôs due to an internalized belief that I deserve to feel bad. 

In this way, my mind has an addiction to suffering. 

And I believe that many other people are also experiencing something very similar to this. Suffering due to the subconscious belief that one deserve to feel bad.",yxlsml,1577,204,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yxlsml/a_profound_realization_the_mind_can_be_addicted/,meditation

OMG, it was so strong! After my heroic dose ( 5g of mushrooms ), it feels like my mind doesn't belong to me anymore. I genuinely understand mediation now. But during this meditation, my head sunk in, and I felt this intense pressure on my throat, feet, hands, and this odd feeling between my eyebrows! I swear to god, it felt like it was blinking.

Came home tonight and realized monkey mind was going nuts (per the norm) so i decided to do an unguided meditation this evening.

This was by far my most mindful meditation ive ever done. Unsure if its because my energy is lower at nights end or what. But i was really able to follow my breath and stay here. So much so that i could not feel my body as part of me. It was surreal. I felt nothing sensory wise. The cool thing is that when i stopped i immediately noticed the chillier temperature of the room. But while i was deep in my meditation i felt nothing regarding that.

Anyway, before i got to the deep part of my meditation my inner voice popped up and said, ""if we do this mindful stuff life is gonna be really boring.""

And there you have it. Theres my ego/shadow/inner child and why my monkey mind exists. It fears a life of boredon. Somehow it feels constantly running in the head about anything is exciting.

193,In what ways may one maintain their mental health?," 

**1. Limit screen time:**

If you're screen-addicted, try to limit your screen time to an hour or two a day. Screen time is a major issue in our society today. It has become commonplace for children and adults to spend hours a day using screens, phones, computers, or television. This constant exposure to screens has negatively affected our mental health.

**2. Connect with friends:**

Meeting with friends regularly can help keep you mentally healthy and connected. There are many ways to connect with friends, including through social media, in person, and groups. Finding friends you enjoy spending time with is important, as social connectedness is linked with happiness. 

**3. Take care of your mental health:**

We need to take care of our mental health because it's important for our happiness and success. There are many ways to take care of our mental health, and we should try different ones until we find the ones that work best for us. We can also help care for our mental health by talking to others about how they're doing and being supportive.

**4. Eat a balanced diet:**

A diet high in unhealthy foods can lead to problems such as obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. It can also lead to mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. Therefore, it helps to improve mental health by providing the body with the nutrients it needs and ensuring that the overall diet is healthy.

**5. Exercise regularly:**

You can enhance your memory and cognitive performance by exercising. Exercise has been demonstrated to enhance cognitive and memory performance. In one study, elderly persons who exercised for 12 weeks had considerable gains in their recall of word lists and performance of basic mental tasks. Exercise of many kinds can enhance cognitive performance.

204,Think I heard God?,"It began a while ago. There was no voice, just radio static. I sit down and begin meditating like usual until I get to a point to where I'm not aware of my physical existence any longer. At first, it sounded as if I was listening to somebody flip through 1000 radio stations, none having a strong connection and all in different languages. I caught a glimpse of German, Spanish, English, and even some I'm not consciously aware of. The voices were faint and I couldn't make out what any of them were saying (btw this is when I'm in a trance state and wasn't necessarily trying to understand them either..more like a silent observer). Then as I continued to meditate, the overlaying static ceased, and through the fog came a calm, peaceful voice that begins to speak. I don't typically realize it's speaking until it's been in full dialogue for a minute. But it's the same voice every time. It's a smooth, deeper-toned, voice. Not overpowering. Relaxing, Direct. Formal. Calm.  I realize also that I'm capable of replying to the voice. Not verbally obviously. But it presents pictures in my head that I can interact with and control. The voice tends to give really good advice.

Intuitively, this makes sense. Meditation invites us to live a life of detachment. During meditation, we see thoughts as they are, random and intrusive whilst keenly observing our emotions (at least, this is the way I meditate). It makes us more present, and focus less on the future.

207,The 1st Hindrance to Deep Meditation," As you develop the skill of meditation, you progressively develop the ability to be able to bring your heart-mind to a state where it is alert, calm, detached, silent, still, and blissful. 

Normally, in the mind of one who is not yet a skillful meditator, there are all sorts of unhelpful processes at play, that obstruct progress: irritations and frustrations, drowsiness and dullness, incessant inner chatter, and so on. They harass your emotional system. These irritate the heart-mind. Some have labelled these ""psychic irritants."" You can see how these types of processes if running in the foreground would keep a person's heart-mind from settling down into a state of being alert, calm, detached, silent, still, and Blissful. They are hindrances to deep meditation.

The Buddha identified five categories of hindrances to deep meditation. Through a robust and disciplined samatha process, one brings these hindrances to cessation for a time, makes them dormant, puts them to sleep. And then the heart-mind automatically slips into deep meditation where it is alert, calm, detached, silent, still, and blissful--it will be the best feeling you know.

And that will change everything.

Not only do the hindrances get in the way of deep meditation, they can also be considered poisons in the heart-mind. They are harming you. They are processes that harass the heart-mind, and drag it into all sorts or problems. Deep meditation is what happens as a consequence of making these hindrances dormant, putting them to sleep. Ok... it's a temporary freedom. But it is more than that, too: experiencing that temporary freedom provides such a sense of relief and fearlessness and well-being that it can't help but provoke insights that help a person make progress towards having that freedom be more robust, and less temporary. How? They give you a taste of just how much better the heart-mind is capable of feeling. They give you a new standard. They recalibrate your sense of what is possible. And they show you how far away you normally are.

### 1st Hindrance - An inordinate orientation towards seeking fulfillment in the world of the senses.

I have met people that talk in a way that disparages even the *idea* of meditation, and who live in a such a way that makes me think they view practice like this:

""Why would I want to go and meditate? Get real. It's boring. Why would I want to turn my back on the lush world of sensual enjoyments and waste time watching my breath in that barren wasteland inside? I'd be missing out on all the action, all the juice--it's out here!! Not inside. I don't want to be bored and waste time when I could be sampling all that life has to offer--another video game, another movie, another coffee, another hit of grass, another piece of cake, another interesting idea....""

*Side Note: Ideas are considered another type of sense object in Buddhism. Why? Because they are one type of mind object, amongst many. Ideas, memories, emotions, desires, etc., are all mind objects, sensed by the mind, just as visual objects are sensed by the eye, or aural objects are sensed by the ear. So there are six senses in Buddhism, rather than the five we normally think of.*

Anyway... a person like the one above is being *strangled* by the 1st Hindrance. It's tragic. Such people are so oriented towards the world of the senses that they cannot even conceive of the benefits of meditation being able to stack up against the competition in the sense sphere. Meditation is seen as being irrelevant at best, perhaps even stupid. You can see how such people are far from getting into meditation at all, let alone deep meditation. The 1st Hindrance is so strong in these people that it completely obstructs the inward journey. Completely.

Those who have a mild interest in meditation but don't actually practice are somewhat better off. They are at least open to the idea that there's something worth going after through meditation. So there's more hope. The 1st Hindrance is much weaker in such people. They are not so firmly shackled to the sense world that they can't see that *perhaps* there is something to this meditation stuff. But they are tied up to the degree that they can't yet pull themselves away long enough to actually start practising.

Someone who actually meditates a bit and has--say, regular access to what I regard as the 1st Stage--is in a much, much better position. Such people have seen for themselves that the inner world is anything but barren, or boring, that there *is* something there worth experiencing. They know it. But most probably they are still attracted to the sense sphere strongly enough that meditation is not yet the focus of their life; it is one practice alongside many others; and so the practice cannot go much deeper for a while. It's going to take time. But if they stick to the practice, long enough, over months and years, they will get there.

As they practice further and get more and deeper experience, like the 3rd stage, the experience is so rewarding that they start to lose their taste for finding satisfaction through the normal outlets. Trying to find one's satisfaction through lining up a string of sensual experiences is seen to be wearying. And it takes a lot of effort and money. And it is dependant on so many other conditions. And it comes often comes with all sorts of strings attached; the bit they are interested in is tangled up with all sorts of problematic threads. And it actually doesn't work very well by comparison with meditation.

The Buddha said that one can't turn away from the dead-end of seeking satisfaction through the senses until one has something better. Well, this is it. The radiant mind in deep meditation feels so much better than the little ""hits"" that comes with sensual experience, that one's fundamental orientation can't help but shift. It just happens. One doesn't even have to work at it. One becomes weary of seeking gratification through the senses. One has a more direct route. The 1st Hindrance now is withering, and deep meditation becomes *easy*.

But to get to this stage, one has to meditate a lot, and probably for many years. And at first it can be tough--the 1st hindrance in the way. And there are four others. I'll write about those in other posts.

What is the cure?  Samatha.

The thing is I've completed the plans on Balance and now I'm not thinking if it will be worth it to continue with the paid subscription given that the new plans don't come that often. Also Headspace is having a -50% black Friday sale which is tempting as well.

219,Seeing stars?,"So as my spiritual journey has progressed this past year especially but began during pandemic with alot of odd occurrences.

It was an odd thing with eyes closed so I opened my eyes‚Ä¶ guess what?‚Äô Still stars all over!!  My room was flooded in stars like I was in the vastness of space,
I got worried and my mind kicked in pulling me out of it and went to sleep.

Last night I attempt again and same thing but this time my mind was quiet and it was so peaceful and beautiful. I opened my eyes again BUT instead of feeling scared I embraced it, the stars stayed with me and it was like my eyes started ‚Äúfluttering‚Äù almost like REM but I was 100%! Awake as my eyes fluttered I felt like my consciousness pulled from body and went into space and time. As my consciousness moved through the millions of stars some would be glowing orbs with a sequence  of pictures inside‚Ä¶ i could make out some of the pictures they were maybe glimpses to alternate realities or future or past maybe? It was weird but so amazing. The more I tried to swim through to these glowing stars and identify the pictures the more my mind
Pushed back or ego and started thinking like this is friggin nuts what am I doing wil I be able to return to my body?
Whatever I did it was beautiful and I want to attempt again but in a better head space with less ego interference.

I understand that this too is a thought but that just makes it seem even more troubling. Do I exist? Am I just blank consciousness?

236,Is this what enlightenment is?,"**English isn't my first language**

I've been meditating for a couple of weeks using Sam Harris's Waking Up app.

Throughout my time meditating, at times, I've gotten the sense that even if there's a physical world, everything that I perceive and know is a model of the inputs of my sensory system. Including the sense that I have a self. Everything that i know is **inside** consciousness.

My question: Is enlightenment the state where the sense that I described above becomes the default perspective even while not meditating?",yxawmp,8,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yxawmp/is_this_what_enlightenment_is/,meditation

239,I had a bizarre experience while meditating and I'm wondering what it might mean.,"*To preface: I understand that it's important to let go of an experience that one has while meditating, but I feel like whatever this was did something to me and I want to know more about it.*

During  body scanning meditation, good thoughts and bad thoughts flooded in and  began to contaminate my mind - as if a plug was lifted from a drain and  the contents of my mind began to swirl into it - two extremes fighting  to the point of me feeling as though I was going to go insane; the whole  time a coffin of light dangling above, in what I perceived to be the  sky (of my mind), and this light was pulling me up and in; I could feel  it sucking my physical/spiritual body like a leech, as if a vacuum was  pulling on my skin.

Eventually I  let go of the good and the bad by using the body scanning technique to  ‚Äúscan"" the good and bad out (I couldn't scan just the bad because the  good would draw it back in, it had to be both) and suddenly I ascended  into the coffin of light, basked in it and then ‚Äúscanned"" it out after  ‚Äúabsorbing it‚Äù or simply, bypassing it, as a means of letting it go, as I  felt I had to go back down.

I've  never before felt as if I was going to go insane during a meditation  practice; after I  was pulled up by the coffin of light, a lot of  conflict/tension that had started two years prior to this experience  lifted up and I felt a huge sense of relief hit me, which was amazing but it left me with a lot of questions. Like when a masseuse fixes you up and you go on wondering ""How did they do that?"" That's the kind of curiosity that I hold onto.

A few weeks after that experience I was doing a Tai Chi or Qi Gong practice, and I was instructed by intuition to change the routine and follow my heart and alter it, and what had occurred was something that I could only see in my minds eye - the pattern was the one where you gather your energy and offer it to the sky (that's how I interpreted it) - this time when I offered it to the sky, my hands came down with a giant basin full of liquid and I was told through thought form by my higher self or intuition (or another entity) that the contents of this basin will never spill. I still perceive it as being there, and in respect to balance, I choose not to put too much importance to it.

Background:  Two years ago I was studying Carl Jung's work and began to work on  integrating my shadow, which lead me to a sort of rediscovery of self,  and sometime after digging deeper into, not only Carl Jung's work, but also alchemy (I was wondering if this relates to the magnum opus in any way because at the time I felt like I was in the process of moving back and forth, or chronologically between, or through the stages). Not too long after delving into this materia(l) I felt like my brain was being overloaded with a new way  of experiencing the world, like my third eye all of a sudden gained the ability to perceive things at ""light speed,"" if that makes sense? And while this all felt like an upgrade, this came with a lot of  grief.

**I'm curious as to what the  whole of this experience could mean (if it even means anything - maybe it's just there to distract me?), and to add, I‚Äôve been  practicing meditation on and off for 9 years now and nothing as extreme as this has ever happened to me.**",yxehe4,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yxehe4/i_had_a_bizarre_experience_while_meditating_and/,meditation

249,"I meditate sitting up with no backrest, but often feel as though I've fallen asleep (even though I'm still upright).

I've found more and more frequently, I'll totally zone out for the duration, and come to at the end feeling pleasantly drowsy, for example:

Last night I went to a group meditation with an instructor I really enjoy. I remember the first few suggestions he gave us, then it was like it was suddenly over, and I only remember a blip or two throughout the 30 minutes. After the session, other people were sharing powerful emotions they'd felt due to how they were guided, but I of course had no input as I couldn't remember a bit of what he said. As I sense the meditation wrapping up and come back to the surface, I always feel really cozy like waking up from a brief nap, but I'm nearly positive I'm not actually sleeping as I'm still sitting totally upright and my head hasn't even fell to the side.

252,Mantra chanting must be the most fun way to meditate.,"Calm down over me using the word must. I am exaggerating but mantra chanting is really dope! It's taken me a long time of the silent type of meditation to get me to appreciate it. For me at the moment, mantra is incredibly fun. 

The point of mantra chanting is the sound. You don't listen for meaning. You listen to hear it. The beautiful language of sanskrit which many mantras are chanted in, the sound itself will teach you. You will learn from the noises alone. In fact, it could even be better that you DONT know the meanings of the words. This is like enjoying listening to spanish music when you dont speak spanish. 

We all hate small talk. I don't think small talk has ever been about the weather. Its about thinking with a small outlook. Limited and narrow. I think small talk will fade away and chanting will be one of the biggest replacements. Hopefully mostly a background of silence for contemplation. Chanting, at least in the mantra form, is not about being repetitious either. It isn;t about repeating the same thing over and over until your mouth muscles are tired and you are terribly bored. I think that kind of chanting is still great and VERY useful to breaking us free from our ruts. I think that you can do so much with mantra. You can play with strictly listening to it.. or you can build your own mantra chant. You can get a sense of how these things just bubble up and flow out of you ON THEIR OWN OF THEIR OWN. You can creative, adventure and discover through chanting. 

I think sound is an easy first step in mediation. Using sound to break us up from the cycles of our own minds. You can definitely break through all the hubbub by focusing on the sound and everything to do with one word. Im sure youve all tried this before. The way that any word, the word, "" albeit "" 
and it will wash you clean and put you in that meditative world that we know nothing about but can feel it.

253,How to be happier through meditation," 

TLDR below, video version on YT (see profile) 

**Why** 

* **Are you struggling to keep attention on your work?** Are you distracted by every WhatsApp notification and are you checking your phone every 5 minutes? You have to train your brain, you are wasting a lot of your precious time and I know how you can improve your life! Today I will help you by guiding you through how you can train your brain through meditation.
* Before I started my self-development journey I was constantly distracted. I was on my phone each time I saw a little notification in the corner of my eye, I was not fully aware of my surroundings and present, and I was not getting the things done that I wanted to get done. I realized this and started researching meditation. The benefits the internet told me it would bring sounded vague and unrealistic from just sitting there, but I was curious about what was behind the technique.

**What** 

* The meditation habit I ingrained in my life helped me to be in control of my mind and to be able to focus with a large attention span. Now, I am able to easily focus throughout following the Pomodoro technique, which makes me immensely more productive than before. Also, I feel more grateful about my surroundings and present with my relationships. 
* **So what is meditation?** 
* Meditation is an empowerment to do whatever you want. If you close your eyes, you are not necessarily meditating. Meditation is not something you do, but it is a quality. It is a consequence.  You need to meditate about the underlying ingredients where the meditation is the consequence. People are often goal-oriented and maybe oriented on emotion or material things. But people are not life-oriented. Think of how you would describe your life‚Ä¶ Are you thinking about your job, studies, relationships, or environment? The only thing that is life, is inside of you. COVID made people more aware of their life. The thing that makes us happy is not necessarily what happens around us, but what goes on inside of us. The house you live in is now a prison, it does not serve your happiness as much as the life inside of you.
* Become meditative, and become mature with your body, mind, emotion, and energy. It is an empowerment for you to do whatever you want without letting the activities around you impact you. To feel this meditativeness and train your maturity, you can take time and space for yourself such that your life and your body are close without distractions.
* **How do you meditate?** 
   * Think of the where and what.
      * You can meditate anywhere, but the optimal place to meditate is in a quiet place where you can sit on the ground. This is optimal for keeping you awake and allowing you to sit for longer periods. 
      * Try to criss-cross your feet on top of each other, let your hands rest on top of each other, and maintain a tall and straight back. Finally, you should close your eyes and keep your head straight. Once you become more experienced you can try to put your feet on top of each other, but this is not a requirement.
      * Focus on your breath, observe every aspect of the breath, and do not judge it. You will notice thoughts distracting you about your daily life, try to notice this without judgment again, and focus back on the breath. It is more than logical that you get distracted, and you should not get demotivated from this, as most people still even experience this after years of meditating. Actually see this as a way of training, as doing a bicep curl in the gym. This is the awareness of meditation. Now you are training in your meditation. 
   * Set an alarm for your meditation session, as it tends to feel longer than it actually is. Based on your experience you can increase the time to around 15 minutes, but you can start with around 5 minutes.
   * Try to meditate every day, and try to make it a daily habit. You will start feeling the benefits of mindfulness in your self-control, patience, and general happiness in some time depending on the frequency and time you put into it besides personal differences.
   * Once you have practiced focusing and being aware of your breath, you can always try different things. The main point is that you should be aware and keep aware of this topic. This can also mean the sounds around you for example. 
   * You can meditate while listening to peaceful music for example. But this is based on personal preferences.
   * To help you maintain this habit, it is important to set a cue for starting meditation. For example, you can start meditating immediately after waking up, having that as your cue. Other possibilities are for example after the shower, or before you start working at your desk. Try to think of a cue that happens every day, so you can make it a daily habit.
   * Don‚Äôt try to empty the mind. There can be thoughts in the mind, you just need to try and be aware of those thoughts. 
   * You can practice with guided meditations, but do not make this a habit as you should try to work with your own mind. 
* **Scientific benefits of meditation**
* There are many benefits to meditation. It for example increases confidence due to a meditative neutralizing effect on social anxiety and stress. Meditation improves your immune system through better working antibodies. And meditation makes you more compassionate and improves empathic abilities due to changing brain waves. The last aspect also reduces social anxiety according to a 2012 clinical psychology review study. 
* A 2015 journal of psychology research study found that meditation transforms the hippocampus and amygdala in your brain. Meditation increases gray matter density in your brain and the size of your hippocampus which improves learning memory and self-awareness. Gray matter is basically the nerves linked to your intelligence in that aspect. And self-awareness is an amazing skill for your life and happiness in general. The amygdala deals with anxiety and fear. Open monitoring meditation reduces the gray matter density in your brain related to depression, anxiety and stress which thus makes it easier for you to be controlled and not let anxiety and stress get to you. It makes it easier for you to move on from certain events and not let things get to you. 
* A Carnegie Mellon University study also found that meditation helps to decrease feelings of loneliness which correlates to morbidity and mortality. 
* Meditation also helps with your attention span. With focused-attention meditation, you train your attention span to focus for longer periods of time, which is incredibly useful in this day and age where distractions are everywhere. Studies have shown that 4 days can be enough to experience these benefits. This relates also to your general self-control and mental discipline, which will make it harder for you to develop addictions such as constantly checking your phone. Your attention span is thus trained, which makes it easier for you to get into a state of flow. If you experienced this before, I think you will like this feeling to be at reach forever. Meditation can help you to get into this state of flow. 
* As found in a UCLA study, long-term meditators have healthier brains than non-meditators. The training you do for your brain keeps your brain young, and there are similarities between 50-year-old meditators and 20-30-year-old healthy people in general. Whereas non-meditators can have decreasing functioning brains. 
* Meditators have higher levels of alpha waves, which reduce emotions of negative mood and sadness. Furthermore, it decreases your blood pressure. 
* Meditators are shown to have increased lengths of telomers which are protective protein complexes in chromosomes in your cells that pretty much protect your DNA. Shorter telomere lengths are correlated to higher chances of for example cardiovascular diseases or cancer, and having increased lengths of these telomers is thus really important. 
* Your brain consists of networks such as the default mode network which handles selfhood and episodic memories which makes it possible to deal with the past, future, and present. This is also the network in the brain that is active when you are mind wandering or overthinking in worries and doubts. A 2010 study from the journal of science discovered that this mind-wandering makes people unhappy and unfocused. A 2011 Yale University study found that meditators slow down these default mode network activities which thus leads to less mind wandering and increased happiness and focus. 
* According to a 2011 Journal of Neuroscience study, meditation can also help you with mental and physical pain. Meditation can affect the mental process of this pain, which helps reduce the pain you experience. 
* A 2008 behavioral medicine study found that meditation is one of the most reliable ways to increase your mood and overall well-being. Apart from that, it changes the perspective of things you see around you, and you will find more happiness in your surroundings too. The conversations you have will be a lot more fulfilling.
* Gratitude and meditation go hand in hand, you will realize the value of the relationships you created with other people, and appreciate them more. Furthermore, meditation will increase the ability of you to be present when you are talking with someone, which they will notice immediately and be grateful for. 
* Meditation helps you to act on your values instead of your feelings. If you see a chocolate bar, you will get a craving for the chocolate bar, but your values say you should not eat the chocolate bar. If you are not meditative, you will indulge and eat the chocolate bar and act on your feelings. If you are meditative, you will observe the consequences of seeing a chocolate bar and think the craving is interesting, but still, you will be able to act on your values and not eat the chocolate bar.

**Call to action** 

* Having focused on adding meditation to my daily routine was one of the best decisions in my life. The benefits I have from being meditative allow me to be a lot happier, more productive, grateful, and confident. The unrealistic benefits meditation was supposed to have pretty much all came true, and I will never go back to the old me. There might still be a little stigma on meditation, but what is the pain in just trying it out for some weeks?
* Start to meditate! Tell yourself to meditate if possible every day for 5 minutes and do not think you need to find exact results within some weeks. Be open to the changes it can make to your brain, and think of it as exercising your mind. Become a better person and live better through meditation!

**TLDR**: 

* **Are you struggling to keep attention on your work?** 
* Meditation is an empowerment to do whatever you want. The thing that makes us happy is not necessarily what happens around us, but what goes on inside of us.
* It is an empowerment for you to do whatever you want without letting the activities around you impact you.
* Try to meditate while sitting straight and focusing on your breath. Do this every day, and try to make it a daily habit.
* Don‚Äôt try to empty the mind. There can be thoughts in the mind, you just need to try and be aware of those thoughts. 
* Meditation has several benefits such as increasing confidence, a better immune system, improved empathic abilities, self-awareness, a better attention span, healthier brains, more gratitude and fewer negative emotions to name a few‚Ä¶ 
* Become a better person and live better through meditation!

269,The Wheel of the Mind - Dissipating the Meditative Hindrance of Restlessness,"Restlessness‚Äìmental restlessness‚Äìin the Buddhist system of training is considered the third of five hindrances that get in the way of deep meditation. Think of restlessness as a jumpiness of mind that strongly resists settling. You want your attention to stay with the meditation object, but it is like a wild horse and just keeps jumping the fence and running away into discursive thinking, reviewing past happenings, planning for the future, or some pointless fantasy‚Äìanything but remaining with the meditation object.

If this is what tends to happen when you meditate, know this: you‚Äôre not alone. There are lots of beginners or folks with little experience asking more experienced meditators the same question: ‚ÄúMy mind won‚Äôt settle down, what do I do?‚Äù

Restlessness is the strongest hindrance to deep meditation for beginners and those without substantial experience. There are five of these hindrances, but restlessness seems to cause all the problems for those just starting out. In a future post I‚Äôll deal with all the hindrances, but I‚Äôm going to stick with restlessness as a topic for now.

Everyone has to go through this phase of weeks or months (probably) when you‚Äôre mind just won‚Äôt settle. And it‚Äôs not a problem entirely confined to beginners. Even an experienced meditator when moving to the cushion will encounter a mind in motion, to some degree, but probably much less than a relatively in-experienced meditator.

Why is it that more advanced meditators can settle their minds more easily? Well, it‚Äôs because they have several advantages. First of all, they know what a quiet, still mind feels like. So they know what to avoid doing before and during their meditation, so as not to behave in ways that are counter productive, that go against that settled feeling. Second, they know what works for them to get them into that state. They have done it literally thousands of times. Third, they have a lot of confidence and patience compared to someone with little experience, which really helps. Fourth, they don‚Äôt get caught up in doubts‚Äìthis is the 5th meditative hindrance, by the way‚Äìwhich keeps a person thinking: this doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs working; does this technique work at all?; maybe I should switch to kasina meditation; or maybe I should try a mantra. And so on, and so on. And the net effect is that the mind feels off balance, can‚Äôt commit to the technique, and wanders through doubt, digging shallow wells everywhere, hitting water nowhere.

Probably the biggest advantage advanced meditators have is that they have tasted the quiet, still mind-state so many times, and found it to be so delightful, and precious, that they try to maintain at least vestiges of it as they move off their cushion and out into their day. They keep an eye on their mental state, frequently. And if they notice the agitation characteristic of a mind that is getting too amped up, they put on the brakes‚Äìapply mindfulness to foster inner silence. And over the months and years of doing this, as they keep watching the mind, abandoning useless mental ramblings, pulling it back towards quietude, their minds gradually becomes quieter and stiller, and they keep it like that almost all of the time. Then, when it comes time to meditate, they just don‚Äôt have so far to go to settle the heart-mind.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, when it‚Äôs time to think, to plan that road trip, to assess the situation you‚Äôve found yourself in and make a decision, to calculate your taxes‚Äìthinking is the right move. But‚Ä¶ to be a competent meditator, and to get into those deep states where all the juice and the insights are, you have to be able to turn that discursive thinking off. And there is the rub. It has become so much of a habit that the untrained person can‚Äôt easily turn it off.

Worse yet, the less experienced meditators are actively making it worse. How? Since he/she has not yet experienced deep meditation, nor developed an overpowering taste for the pleasures of a quiet, still mind, he/she finds pleasure in externals, in diversion, and has cultivated the habit of letting the mind go out to find it, now here, now there, anywhere. And this has been going on for so long that it has become an ingrained habit.

But meditation is in the opposite direction. And that habit is going to make it tough for you when you sit down and try to meditate, and your cranked up heart-mind just drags your attention off of the meditation object again and again and into some irrelevant, pointless, possibly inane, mental excursion. A big part of the storm in your life is in fact self-generated.

 

Now in order to get into deep meditation, you have to bring that wheel to a stop, for a time. That‚Äôs what samadhi is. But all this mental activity constitutes a restlessness in the mind that opposes the movement towards stillness.

What to do?

Samatha practice is your best tool \[see the post on Samatha in Brief\]. But it‚Äôs got to be applied for a reasonable duration‚Äì10 minutes a day isn‚Äôt going to cut it. And it‚Äôs got to applied regularly‚Äìevery day, or darn near every day.

Let‚Äôs say you take the normal, amped up mind-state of John Q Public‚Äìon average the wheel of his mind is spinning pretty fast‚Äìand he takes up meditation, and he sits, and he even has pretty good sessions. He stills his mind a bit. The wheel of his mind is now spinning somewhat slower. Way to go! But let‚Äôs say he only sits on weekends, or every so often. By the time he sits again, the wheel has revved right back up to where it was before he started. So the small amount of stilling he gets from each individual session never accumulates and his heart-mind remains way too agitated to drop into deep meditation in any of his sessions. 

 Now, let‚Äôs say that he starts meditating every day, twice a day, working up to 45 minutes in the morning, and 45 minutes in the evening. And he misses no days, or only a day every month or two. Like before, every time he sits the wheel slows down a little bit, and after the meditation the wheel slowly starts gaining momentum again. But since he meditates a lot, the wheel doesn‚Äôt get a chance to get back to its previous momentum before he is sitting yet again. And so each day he stills the wheel just bit more.

Over three months he will have practiced over 135 hours. Practising at this rate can tip the balance, to where the restlessness of the heart-mind becomes *substantially* less and progressively reaches a new-normal, a mind state that is close enough to deep meditation that in a 45 minute session he can get at least to the 1st stage of meditation \[see post on Samatha Stages\] much of time to begin with, and eventually all the time.

 Consider this: In a previous post I mentioned that when over sixteen years ago I finally began meditating every day, more happened in the first three months than in the previous three decades of meditating sporadically.

I'm not exaggerating.

This, I believe is one big reason why advanced meditators are able to get into the deeper states. They have learned to love a quiet mind, so they work at maintaining it most all the time, so it doesn‚Äôt ramp up as much, and in addition they are sitting so frequently that they are regularly bleeding off speed at a rate that keeps their minds relatively settled. Hence, their normal mind state is just closer to the drop zone, which in addition to their experience, skill, and patience just makes hitting the bulls-eye a regular event.

Ok‚Ä¶ What to do?

First‚Ä¶ at whatever level you are practicing, whenever you manage to slow down the wheel a bit and feel that sweet relief and pleasure associated with a quieter mind, drink it in. Bask in it. And try to maintain it as long as you can, even after you get up from the cushion. ‚ÄúGuard your samadhi,‚Äù goes the saying.

Second‚Ä¶ It is necessary to meditate regularly, to avoid missing days‚Äìexcept for an occasional one, every month or two, and to sit for long enough durations. I always recommend about 45 minutes for your normal maintenance session. If you are far from that now, work up to it.

Third‚Ä¶ another good option is to go on a meditation retreat to kickstart the process. If as a relative beginner you are able to sit even four hours a day for a week‚Äìand practise samatha, and know what you‚Äôre doing‚Äìyou will tend to get at least to the 1st stage, maybe the 2nd.

But.. regardless of how you get the mind to settle, if you don‚Äôt maintain a fairly solid practice life in your day-to-day life, you‚Äôll lose it.

Be well.

275,feels like common knowledge that the experience of meditation varies across sessions,"but even then i am still surprised by the forms it can take when it‚Äôs different

random rambling thoughts below:

the commitment to the activity is all that‚Äôs necessary 

sometimes it‚Äôs like diving right into presence and my consciousness is bathing in all the sensory input from the eternal Now

but also it might turn out that for 10 minutes all perception feels clouded by Mind ¬Æ and my Thoughts‚Ñ¢Ô∏è are preoccupied with ego (ü•ö¬©) telling stories about meditation and imagining encounters with people where i tell them all about it, or whatever nonsense the egoic mind presents me with that day or hour

and in those 10 mins maybe there are flashes of presence

and then for four minutes after that you‚Äôre plunged into a supercharged sense of Now 

or maybe the whole thing is foggy and i move to another location and get a reset and it‚Äôs an opportunity to tune in with the Now again

or maybe another time the presence is just so glaringly obvious and enveloping that it‚Äôs unavoidable and it wouldn‚Äôt occur to me that my experience could be any other way

it‚Äôs the commitment to the activity. Maybe later i notice residual effects or ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù or more creativity or whatever, but those aren‚Äôt the reason i meditate either

the other day a post on here asked ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the best part of meditation?‚Äù and one comment was ‚Äúthe best part of meditation is that i get to meditate‚Äù and that‚Äôs how i feel too

but of course during the god damn meditation all the above were the stories my ego was spinning ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what ego does, it spins webs of stories about things. 

It‚Äôs a reason i don‚Äôt like to really talk about meditation, cuz i don‚Äôt want my ego weaving stories about it. That and i don‚Äôt like the word ‚Äúmeditation‚Äù because it‚Äôs a loaded term now. I wish it were called something like ‚Äúunburdening‚Äù or ‚Äúrealization‚Äù but those are also terms that are highly inexact and ineffective to the extent they invite conceptualization or intellectualization of the thing

276,What have you learned/experienced as a result of meditation?,"I've 'meditated' for 10 years, but I've ""actually"" meditated for about 3 weeks.\*

anyway, the stuff I've noticed:

* I don't immediately react when something frustrates/annoys me. I'll think ""hmm this is frustrating/annoying"" and choose how I want to respond. and in my relationship, I'll actually stop and say ""that made me feel X, even though I know you didn't mean for it to"" which is true, but normally I'd just get quiet and leave. This has also lead to my partner being more reflective vs being defensive. There have actually been a ton of changes in my relationship overall
* Mono-tasking is so much easier. I both find it less appealing to multi-task, and more enjoyable to just focus on work when I need to
* I find more enjoyment from life in general, especially the quiet moments/""boring"" things
* More aware of how things impact me, whether that be my environment, advertising, conversations, sleep, etc. Before things would just happen and my mood would change without me being conscious of it. Now, I can feel the difference and make changes if needed, being more of an active participant vs passive.
* mental chatter has quieted immensely
* Meditation is something I look forward to, not what I have to do. Both because I can clearly see the benefits, and also because it just feels good during the session itself. This was definitely not the case when I was 'fake meditating' for years
* I've had more lucid dreams

**What have you learned?**

===

By ""actual"", I mean the difference in experience and outcomes are so different that I don't even really consider the vast majority of my previous ""meditations"" to be meditating. it was just lying down and trying to clear my mind while listening to a guided meditation. for me the difference was purely just sitting vs not sitting. and also doing it at a time where I would be alert, e.g. not just before I went to bed.

281,Recommendations for learning the foundation? I‚Äôve been doing guided meditation and have had results with chakra balancing. I feel like having more background will help grow my practice! Thanks!,"I‚Äôve tried different types of guided meditation. It started out as sleep meditation a few years ago. I noticed that it would lull me to sleep, but I don‚Äôt visualize things well. 

Last year I found a guided chakra meditation on you tube that I‚Äôd do from time to time. Recently, with stress of life, I‚Äôve picked that back up to try to center myself. 

The results have been amazing. It‚Äôs been about 2 weeks of morning meditation. The YouTube video is 20 minutes long but I find myself remaining in a meditative state for around 40 minutes, 20 minutes after the video ends. 

I have felt a rush of euphoria. My body feels relaxed. I feel great while in that state. I feel refreshed when I end my meditation. 

I don‚Äôt know anything about meditation! I would like to know more. The chakra meditation is a healing meditation. I can feel the energy at each spot. I can tell when one is blocked. It doesn‚Äôt tingle as much or feel as intense. In my 2 week practice I have felt more ‚Äúunblock‚Äù, from the start my throat and third eye have always tingled. My root is getting there. My solar plexus as of yesterday is opening and it is intense. My sacral, heart, and crown need work. 

The guided meditation is nice. But I would like a longer meditation, allowing for more time at each spot. I would like to get to a point where I do it on my own. 

Do you guys recommend any podcasts that talk about learning the practice? Or any books? When I first experienced the euphoria I googled it and ended up with a wiki page. The context is there but I don‚Äôt really understand it!

I want to cultivate mental well-being and peace, and not have it affected by my physical pain or symptoms. I was wondering if anybody here has any personal experience with this. Is it possible or (I guess, more importantly) realistic to do even in the wake of more intense physical symptoms? Has anybody on this sub successfully done this?

I started using apps to have a meditation daily cas those outings were not daily. I worked my ways through various curations for mindfulness, and for lack of a better term, Emotional Intelligence/Psychology/Behavior/Life Skills Management paradigm or type of meditations.

Come 2020, I lost all my in-person practice and switched over to app. I also switched over to Waking Up app, and started getting exposure to meditations that go beyond the above, where, for lack of a better term, explore our true nature, a more spiritual in the non-religious sense of being.

I‚Äôm drawn to that investigation and am curious about this, thing, or no-thing.

I‚Äôve tried to follow along and do that type of meditation by myself with the app, and find I get lost and in need of some kind of guidance.

Also, of the various spiritual speakers on Waking Up app, I find myself drawn to those who talk about and offer some Zen type of meditations. There are talks of things like energy that I‚Äôm like what is this?

289,What is self realization?,"&#x200B;

When we gain a realization, that essentially means we understand and accept as a reality that which is already a reality. By extension, when we become self-realized, we understand and accept as our self that which is our real self.¬†

Why is our understanding of who we are different from who we actually are? Because of our self-image: our conception of who we are. Our self-image is generally socially constructed, being derived from how people perceive us. If we grew up being negatively compared with a sibling, our inferiority to that sibling may become our self-image. If we were told that we were not fair enough or slim enough or tall enough, those may become our self-images.¬†

Not all self-images center on seeing ourselves in an unnecessarily negative light; some may center on seeing ourselves in an unjustifiably positive light. If we were brought up in an ethnic or religious or economic community that considered itself superior to other communities, our elite status may become central to our self-image. If we had some talent far more than others, our superiority over them may characterize our self-image.¬†

Do we have many self-images? Frequently, yes; simultaneously, we often have one central self-image that defines us the most.¬†

Beyond all such self-images is our actual self: the essence of who we are. Wisdom texts explain that the self is spiritual and indestructible. We all are sentient beings, presently manifest as sparks of consciousness. Our consciousness radiates outward from our heart to our entire body and to our outer world. And based on the nature of our social interactions, our consciousness becomes filled with a particular self-image. The more our self-image becomes aligned with our actual self, the more we become self-realized. Put another way, when we are fully self-realized, who we think we are becomes harmonious with who we actually are.¬†

**One-sentence summary:** 

Self-realization is the increasing alignment of our self-image with our actual self.¬†

**Think it over:**¬†

* What keeps us from self-realization?
* What is your defining self-image?
* What is self-realization?¬†¬†",yw31h0,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yw31h0/what_is_self_realization/,meditation
290,FAQ: Is it ok to scratch an itch during meditation?,"A: Yes

I see a lot of people asking this question due to the notion that one must ignore or dissociate from any external or bodily stimuli during meditation; as if what we do as a daily practice should be comparable and held to a similar standard to what disciplined monks do.

In my opinion and experience, there is absolutely nothing wrong with addressing an itch during meditation. Additionally, I am a proponent of keeping a bottle of water handy during meditation in the event that you get thirsty or your mouth gets dry. I find that most things that are a brief pause to address something that could be excessively distracting during a sit are worth it.

Let me know your thoughts and experience!

Update: So far there has been some great discussion on this subject. There is seemingly quite the split between ""yes/no on scratching the itch"". I think the most effective and balanced approach I've heard is: whether you scratch or not, be sure to observe and experience the itch/scratch as you would any thought, emotion, or external stimuli. Do you agree? Thanks for the great responses! ",yuyftl,348,102,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yuyftl/faq_is_it_ok_to_scratch_an_itch_during_meditation/,meditation
291,What Mindfulness Misses: Full Range Emotional Mastery,"Picture a room of 25 senior military leaders. 

They‚Äôre arranged in a long oval with one end open facing a projector and teacher. But they‚Äôre not sitting and watching. 

They‚Äôre jumping up and down, cheering, smiling, and high fiving. They‚Äôre about to blow the roof off the place! The most macho guy in the room - a 6‚Äô4‚Äô sergeant major - fireman carries his friend out of the room. It‚Äôs all smiles.

That was my personal highlight from a 3-day leadership training I hosted last weekend. 

I learned tons from this experience, but what I keep coming back to is a feeling that I stumbled upon some previously unknown dimension of meditation and mental training -  what I call full range emotional mastery. 

When we think of traditional meditation or mindfulness we typically think of someone who is pleasant, calm, and dignified. Think of a Buddhist monk sitting in meditation. That‚Äôs a great way to be (and frankly most of the population never quite gets there). 

After several thousand hours of mindfulness meditation practice including 4 months living as a Zen monk - I like to think I'm pretty good in this domain of emotional mastery (excluding competitive sports like softball and putt putt). 

I frequently hear things like - ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so Zen‚Äù. 

Now, I‚Äôm thankful that I‚Äôve worked to cultivate this capacity but what I realized this past weekend is that my mental training practices (e.g. meditation) tend to center around a rather limited range on the emotional spectrum.                    

Think of a standard coordinate plane x and y axis. Imagine positive mood (good feeling) and negative mood (bad feeling) on opposite ends of axis. On the other axis there‚Äôs low energy and high energy. 

Negative mood and low energy corresponds to sadness or depression. Negative mood and high energy on the other hand is more like rage or anger. Likewise think of the difference between serenity/ultimate relaxation versus enthusiastic excitement. Both of them are positive feelings but they have different energy. 

Now let me preface this by saying - maybe I‚Äôm meditating wrong! It wouldn‚Äôt be the first time and won‚Äôt be the last. But in my experience, most schools of meditation center around the middle of this graph. It's mostly about awareness. It's maybe slightly calming and slightly positive. 

When my practice is most consistent my general state is a slightly pleasant, relaxed alertness. Typical meditation is building our capacity to remain grounded and centered in calm awareness. 

Now here‚Äôs what I'm getting at when I say this misses something - it leaves out mental training in the upper quadrants of the graph we imagined above. This is particularly true for high energy, highly positive states. 

It‚Äôs hard to picture the Dalai Lama pumping up the crowd, screaming with excitement, and spontaneously dancing around. This can place us in the predicament of an incredibly gifted singer who never practices hitting the high notes. Or a marathon runner who never runs sprints. It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs a critical problem - but it‚Äôs the equivalent of having some underdeveloped muscles. 

I‚Äôm not advocating that we become Rob Lowe‚Äôs perpetually over-enthusiastic character from Parks n Rec. Nor that we have to bounce off the walls in sheer excitement and ecstasy 24/7 (that would be exhausting). As one of my favorite speakers once said of emotional energy - ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt shoot a canon at a rabbit. It‚Äôll work, but there won‚Äôt be any rabbit left.‚Äù 

What I‚Äôm talking about here is our *capacity* to become a canon. It‚Äôs building up our full range of emotional muscles so that when the time is right we CAN bounce off the walls or experience sheer ecstacy. I believe that like physical muscles - emotional muscles are ‚Äúuse it or lose it‚Äù. So we want to keep tabs on our end range emotional fitness too. 

**If you‚Äôre with me so far - mindfulness meditation is an incredibly valuable tool and it often lacks in training the upper ranges of high energy, positive states.**

Why does that matter? Is it really necessary to be able to turn up our emotional energy to 11/10 or overflow with energy and enthusiasm? 

No, it‚Äôs not necessary, but it is ideal. It‚Äôs optimal. And I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs necessary for an exceptional life. 

I‚Äôm not talking ‚Äúexceptional life‚Äù in the way our society has trained us to imagine it. As some figurehead getting cheers on a big stage or running a billion dollar company. I‚Äôm talking about living in a way where we authentically connect with, move, and encourage people. It‚Äôs not about achievement as much as our role as a parent, friend, teacher, and community member. It‚Äôs bringing out the best in ourselves and others. And in my experience, the upper ranges of positive emotion are essential to this. 

Emotion is the currency of human interaction. Enthusiasm, inspiration, and the energy to do anything are readily transmitted from person to person. 

Would anyone argue that our species wouldn‚Äôt benefit from more positive emotions? And I‚Äôm not talking about sensory pleasure - more stimulation, more junk food, more highs. I‚Äôm talking about high quality, nourishing positive emotions like gratitude, joy, and love. 

An exceptional life is one that is exceptionally rich in these states of being. And it lifts up others with it. That‚Äôs the only measure of ‚Äúexceptional‚Äù I care for. 

As Thich Nhat Hanh said - ‚ÄúLiving peacefully and happily is the best way to show our gratitude and is our greatest gift for the world and the next generation‚Ä¶ Our children need our happiness, not our money.‚Äù

So again I‚Äôm not saying we all need to be at a full tilt 11 out of 10 all the time. But there are times when we‚Äôll need to encourage and inspire others - this could be in a presentation, a leadership role, or just as a friend/parent. And in moments like that, having the emotional muscle to transmit a charge of positive energy is essential. Emotions reach people far more readily than words.

Emotion is the currency of human interaction. 

As we come to a close I admit that while grounded in my direct experience as a meditation practitioner, this post leans a little more self-help guru sounding than I'd like. So I'll leave off with a friendly experiment that you can try on yourself. 

**I‚Äôve suggested that (1) most of us (even experienced meditators) are a bit deficient in full range emotional mastery and that (2) developing this capacity will lead to a better life.** 

Here's an experiment to try. 

Part 1 

Answer this question, when is the last time you‚Äôve gone to 11/10? We‚Äôre talking unreal excitement, enthusiasm, cheering, laughing, teeming with joy‚Ä¶ How often does that happen? 

Maybe it‚Äôs been awhile? If I‚Äôm being honest I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm generally pleasant, even cheerful, but not in this place too often‚Ä¶ 

Now try to get into that state for a minute right now. Go ahead - crank it up - summon it - act it out‚Ä¶ 

If you‚Äôre like me then you don‚Äôt get to this place too often AND you can‚Äôt just snap your fingers and get there. That right? 

That‚Äôs my experiment to suggest that most of us are lacking in these upper range emotional muscles. 

Part 2

This one is going to require some bravery. Think of that 11/10 place we just mentioned. And think of a a person you'll see today that you'd like to show up for at this level. And if you can‚Äôt get all the way to 11 per say that might be for the best (so they don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve lost it). 

But try to think of at least doubling your usual emotional energy level for how you meet them. Before you see them get some movement going, maybe jump around. Just act out being super excited as if you're trying to get an oscar. Pretend you‚Äôre being reunited like a kid pulling up to their best friend‚Äôs house - you just can‚Äôt wait to see them. 

See how this changes things (especially if the person you show up for is a partner or family member). And if you notice how that‚Äôs different. Ask yourself why not show up for them like this all the time?

This sort of out there little experiment is one I‚Äôve found pretty fundamentally life changing. 

I feel the greatest gift I can give people is not money or advice or anything like that. It‚Äôs presence and positive emotion. And to this end I've decided to make ""full range emotional mastery"" a part of my meditation practice.

292,Dilemma,"How long have you been meditating? What type of meditation do you practice? Do you count your time invested in the practice of meditation? What are your realizations?

I don't have much experience in practicing meditation. For the past 3 years I have spent around 1200 hours of solo daily meditation and have taken two 10-day Vipassana retreats and one 3-day retreat. I have practiced Yoga for around 800 hours by myself following an app.

My motivation and determination came out because I used to be a chronic sufferer of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder and nothing really helped, all was tried. Depression teached me a lot. For 10 years I have suffered chronically. Meditation is the only refuge I have found to keep up with living.

Though I am at peace now, I still find Life a nonsense. I'm 30 and thinking of retirement. The only thing I want is to have this financial freedom so I can buy time rather selling it to a job. I want to buy my time and spend it mainly on retreats. I feel very drawn to continue practicing, not because it fixed my mind, not because I want to get enlightened, not because I am looking for something specific. I just want to sit as much as possible.

I cannot describe decently my perplexity to why do I have to live if I didn‚Äôt choose it? Or did I? If not, why this ‚Äúthing‚Äù or force or will or whatever it is behind all creation wants to express and take a form of life? Why suffering is a mandatory and a necessary prerequisite? How strong the will to turn the longing to live in the will to not live? Why the need to fill the empty nothing with worldly illusions? Why is the unstoppable ever-happening present manifesting so determined to exist? And then, if you terminate all the formations within yourself consciously and eliminate the vital force, how certain is that this very life energy won‚Äôt erupt at some point and take you back to this realm? Is it possible to ignore suffering? I guess not. You live it. Breath by breath. Such a nonsense‚Ä¶

An observation that was depicted in my experience is that depression reveals itself to be a great teacher, if not the best, if you undergo for the full course, and peculiarly quirky and fascinating at the same time is that same lessons can be learned from the practice of meditation, in a more elegant way. With more clearer realizations. Depression and meditation‚Äôs ways of experiencing oneself are like two blind brothers, with opposite approaches in seeking the same thing forgotten on different roads. The same emptiness with opposite views on it.

Death shapes my Life and that is both a relief and an ominous joy. The reality is fully distorted with illusions. I can see it more clearly now, and if I had the choice to experience life and existence again, I would choose not to be born at all. In any form.  I do cherish this very life dearly now, but I can't attach any meaning to it. Is it selfish to want to only meditate?

293,"How do I maintain daily mindfulness by not getting involved with the content of my thoughts, feelings and emotions when at the same time I need to tackle them head on in order to solve problems by getting involved?

There are these times where I feel I'm on the right track but then there are moments like these when I start doubting the practice and myself.

Meditation and mindfulness want you to step back and observe the thoughts, feelings, emotions without getting involved in their content. How then do you maintain mindfulness throughout the day especially when there are strong thoughts, feelings and emotions that are creating disturbances in your mind and life. By not being involved with their content, how do I solve them? I need to understand my emotions so I have to get involved. I need to solve the problems that my thoughts are ""talking"" about, I can't just ignore my problems, so I need to get head on with thinking, analyzing, making decisions etc., i.e. get involved with the thoughts. Otherwise I'll just be noting ""thinking, thoughts"" etc. without doing anything about them until they pass.

300,"meditation, l.s.d, psilocybin mushrooms, hallucinations and addictions","meditation is defined in many different ways, be they mystical, cultural, or scientific. the benefit of meditation is in allowing opportunity for your brain to process backlogs of input/experience. you can suppose that you have meditated sufficiently when you can honestly say that you don't need time to think.

what happens when you keep meditating even after you've processed all of your input? we can know what happens in three ways:
1) we can listen to what others have to say on the issue
2) we can experience it for ourselves 
3) and we can model this with machine learning via digital neuronal networks

simulated neuronal networks that have no input will, if properly designed to mimic the brain, form feedback loops. the networks nodes can start adapting to static/garbage as if it were important. in the human mind this garbage feedback is experienced in the form of hallucinations such as is commonly experienced in sensory deprivation and solitary confinement.

these hallucinations are the product of pure garbage input like a squealing speaker system when the sound output is the product of microphone feedback. we can also induce this state quickly with drugs that screw with our senses and neuronal networks.

some people have suggested that these hallucinations can be valuable. it is my assertion that they are not. i do believe that some drugs that cause hallucinations can be valuable, not because they cause hallucinations but because of how they cause hallucinations. it has been found that some drugs scramble our neuronal networks somewhat and that scrambling disrupts some naturally occurring feedback loops. one consequence of disrupting these networks is hallucinations. this process is a lot like cutting the microphone to stop the feedback squeal. among the greatest benefits of the neuronal pathway scrambling is disruption of addictive behaviors.

contrary to the claims of some experts, the hallucinations of extreme meditation don't replicate the benefits of these drugs. moderate meditation can help by reducing stress and allowing some self reflection though mediation doesn't disrupt those feedback loops, if anything meditation creates feedback loops that can be destructive as is the case with people who are isolated for too long.

i suggest meditation when you have some external cause to be stressed. i do not suggest meditation when the stress is possibly due to a mental disorder. in the case where a person is suffering from addiction or self-destructive thought patterns, i suggest l.s.d or psilocybin mushrooms, which are now known to disrupt (if only temporarily) those feedback loops.

an added benefit (or primary benefit for some) of those drugs is the ability to see one's circumstances with a different part of the brain. ""with new eyes"", as the expression goes.

contrary to government propaganda, these drugs cannot be addictive. the opposite is true. because of how they operate, they, of all substances, cannot be addictive. whether it is incompetence, ignorance or malice matters not. the illegal designation of these drugs by the government is inexcusable.",yvp2z5,7,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yvp2z5/meditation_lsd_psilocybin_mushrooms/,meditation

304,Inner child healing mediation,"I wanted to share with you a powerful healing meditation that I've stumbled across.  I'm sure many others have done this as well before.  As many of us do, there were some tough moments in my childhood that contributed to my disconnection.  That same disconnection would drive my behavior in ways that I wasn't always proud of.  

That behavior would look like the need for external validation.  Needy to a point where my relationships would suffer.  I would withdraw and give people silent treatment.  I'd be wallowing away in my own self-pity party of one.  None of this ever served me or made things better.  

As my meditation practice grew over the years, I became aware that this was a response to old wounds.  For example, having an event when I was a child that got me emotional.  The response from others was to control my behavior.  That control came at the express of disregarding my emotional needs.  As a kid, I didn't know how to express that at the moment.  Invalidated and feeling shame/guilt, I learned to disconnect as my coping mechanism.

That became a pattern in my life, which became a significant limiting factor.  I had to heal that.  How?

In my mediations, I would visualize those past events.  I would see my adult self come to my childhood self and provide the emotional support that I needed.  The support that I didn't get then, I was able to find a way to give that to myself now.  This started created a massive shift in my emotional connection.  It improved the relationship I had with myself.  Which resulted in an increase in the quality of relationships with others.

The voice in my head just disappears and time moves faster.

Compare that to when I sit down in a relaxing place and become extremely mindful of things around me, every sound, smell, sense, touch etc... both internal and external. 
I sit down and reflect on what has happened to me, and how I've responded over the last few days. And I assess whether Im proud of my actions. Then I plan somethings for the near future. 

I find these two mental states on the opposite end of a spectrum with most of the time being in between. 

Simple question: Which of these two states, mindlessness or reflection, is meditation supposed to put me in?",yvq222,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yvq222/mindlessness_or_reflection/,meditation

313,I am the wave who forgot it was the whole ocean.,"I am the silence from which all sounds arise.
I am the space between each thought. 
I am the unchanging, universal center of experience that bears witness to an ever changing world. 
And I am aware that I am aware. 

My mind may grow in knowledge
And my body in age,
Yet the I who sees all this somehow remains unchanged. 

I am the kingdom of heaven within. I am where you have come from, and I am where you will return to. Though I cannot be found in time nor space.

I am the love within you,
And I am also your beloved.

I am everywhere but nowhere. 
I am every thing, but no - thing. 

Slowly surrender yourself into me and I will consume you whole. 

For I am the light of the sun that gives freely of itself, expecting nothing in return.  

Shining bright above the clouds on even the most stormiest of days. 

The further you move away from me, the colder it will get. For it is the cold that serves to bring you back into the warmth.
With a willingness and gratitude. 

You can find me in a lover.
You can find me in a friend. 
But you will eventually find that comes to an end. 

Unless you find me at my source, only glimpses of me can be seen. 

For I am the light of life,
inherit in us each.

Turn your attention inwards and you will no longer need to seek.

315,My Experience,"I am a 17 year old who had thought about meditation before but haven‚Äôt really acted on it, I heard many things from different people such as ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard starting out‚Äù or polar opposites from people who have been meditating for years, about a year ago I decided I would change my religion as I was baptized Roman-Catholic, I looked into Buddhism and really felt a connection, now this is not me saying that you need to meditate to be buddhist, but as of now I‚Äôm saying that it helps connect you to the topics and beliefs. Today I set a timer for myself as I only wanted to try it for 5 minutes or so, just because I didn‚Äôt want to set expectations way too high for myself, fortunately my phone is on silent and I didn‚Äôt hear it go off so I thought to myself ‚Äúthis is a really long five minutes‚Äù but I relented and sat patiently in presence of myself and my surroundings, turns out I had been meditating, thoughtless and motionless for 15 ish minutes while my phone was telling me my timer was done. It was possibly the best experience I‚Äôve had in a while, it cleared my mind and reset me mentally for the rest of the day, I really recommend meditation for anyone who is looking into it, or anyone who‚Äôs going to quit.

317,Can you suggest me a practice to cultivate hope/stop being anxious towards becoming myself?,"Hey people!

I've lately found enough time and energy to work on some things that were bothering me about myself, things I needed to address. But the problem is that I have like 5 to 6 different avenues which will require long-term commitment. That means that I fail at doing at least some of them every day, and that some weeks I am more focused on one of them in detriment of the others, etcetera

This is giving me some anxiety, because it feels like a big neverending battle, I am getting tired of pushing this stone uphill, and, making some progress, but also failing here and there, and feeling that at any point I could just ""forget"" to do one of the things that I feel are important, and realize months later that I just stopped doing it.

I am accepting rational/emotional analysis about how I am creating too much expectation out of myself, or how I should tackle only one thing at a time, but to be fair, I don't think I will be able to incorporate the many ways to look at this. I would really like some sort of practice that could help me be calm and put things into perspective on a day-by-day basis, and I was wondering if this rings a bell to y'all?

To give some perspective I think I am on my... second year of meditation in pseudo-serious practice, I mostly enjoy ohm chanting, fire-breath-like pranayamas and candle gazing.",yve9kc,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yve9kc/can_you_suggest_me_a_practice_to_cultivate/,meditation

When I started I remember I was so restless and use to think while meditating that am I doing it right, and I had no answer to it since it was subjective to just me. Slowly and steadily I realized that there is no answer as ther is no question and acceptance is the key. 
Now, when I meditate such questions do pop up initially while meditating but I know now that any and everything is ok just continue bringing myself back to watching the breath as that's the only reality in that moment, and after a while I reach a state which I call Formless as most of you might have experienced it.
Formless state is something which can't be described so I won't even try describing it, you just have to experience it.
Last thing I will say regarding achieving the Formless state is, it helps tremendously in my day to day life by providing meaning to everything i do be it my family, friends or work.",yup6eh,11,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yup6eh/meditation_3_months_experience/,meditation

So I hope that people who have this paradigm will read this post.

I've been pretty depressed my whole life and recently I was so desperate to pull myself out of a particularly bad episode, that I was willing to try anything to get better.  I read the first chapter of The Mind Illuminated, and started meditating 20-30 mins a day, everyday, for the past month.

I wish I had found this sooner.  No miracle has happened and I'm still not where I want to be, but I am so much farther than where I started.  In this time I have noticed a profound quieting of my mind, a better understanding of myself, and so much more love for myself.  I get excited about my daily meditation, not because it is particularly enjoyable or fun, but because of how much it is helping me.

354,No progress after 1261 days of consistent meditation,"Approximately 3.5 years ago, I began my meditation practice as a way of reducing my migraine attacks and improving my wellbeing.

Instead of setting lofty goals of an hour of meditation a day or even 30 minutes of continuous meditation, I confined myself to 1-minute sessions twice a day. Then, when I felt more or less confident about increasing the duration, I added another minute. And another. And another. 

This process went on for about 2-3 months until I reached the 20-minute mark twice a day. Since then, I haven‚Äôt altered my routine much. Very rarely, I merely change the object of concentration, the state of my eyelids (open or closed) or use a guided meditation by Sam Harris. 

The issue I‚Äôm struggling with is the sense that I‚Äôm moving nowhere in my practice. I‚Äôm still an angry, bitter, unsatisfied teenager who can‚Äôt control himself in the face of pleasure and pain.

Has meditation helped me combat bad habits and addictions? No. In the past couple of weeks, I‚Äôve been indulging in sensory pleasure more and more. I‚Äôve tried applying mindfulness to amend the situation, but that was unsuccessful.

Has it increased my levels of peace and calmness? No.

Has it helped me with my anxiety problems? No. I still worry about trivial things that might happen and ruminate about my past mistakes.

Has it made me more present with other people? No. I frequently find myself zoning out and entering the vegetable state of no thinking and no awareness whatsoever when talking to other people.

Has it improved my concentration, at least? No. I can‚Äôt even concentrate on more than two consecutive breaths. After that, I get lost in thought.

I can‚Äôt help but compare myself to other people, who claim that meditation has been a game-changer for them, which incessantly helps them to lead a better existence. 

I know that I‚Äôm introducing a paradox here, because the real point of meditation is to go beyond this concept of progress. My consciousness is already free of the problems I‚Äôm trying to solve. Yet, I‚Äôm not willing to spend 40 minutes a day doing something that doesn‚Äôt make me better in any way. I can spend that time more productively by learning to program or preparing for my final exams.

What should I do? What am I doing wrong? I thank you for reading through this post and trying to help me.

Its like i'm getting more averted to how ugly the world is, so i meditate more and more. Less anything to do with the actual reality.

This surely cannot be the goal of meditating? I feel like i'm escaping, shouldnt i be able to be more at ease with the world as such?

Its like i'm getting more in tune , sensitive,and i do not see what i like.

Its making me hate the world. The bad things are too much too grasp. 

I can easily go into a meditative state and go ""this is very peacefull"".

I'm lying to myself i feel , so many horrible things going on.

359,What you think about Space-Time-Bridging meditation?,"Once, after meditation, I thought about why I want things so much. And here's an interesting idea. When I think about an apple that is in my kitchen, I may want to eat it, but if I imagine an apple that is in the kitchen of the same me in a parallel universe, then I don‚Äôt care about this apple in a parallel universe, that is, it turns out that the desire to eat an apple arises not even from the thought itself, but from perception. For some reason it seems to me that the enlightened see the world through the eyes of a parallel universe. It seemed to me that this podcast was about developing the ability to perceive the world in an optimal way and training the skill of perception through meditation.

I tried to write out the main ideas so that you can understand what's going on there without watching it, but I'll still leave the link below.

&#x200B;

Key points from podcast.

  **Interoseption** is everything that we sense at the level of our skin and inward. Sensation on stomach heart beating, what we are feelling on the surface of our skin, how cold or hot we feel. 

 Opposite is exteroseption**. Exteroseption** is peception of everything that's outside or beyond the confines of our skin.  

Another opposite of interoseption is **dissotiation**. 

Interoseption refers to a process by which your nervous system meaning your brain and connections with your body senses, interprets, integrates and regulates signals originating from within the body and thereby provides a moment-to-moment mapping of your internal landscape at both a conscious and unconscious level.  Okay, that's a lot of words to describe basically the process of perceiving what's happening at the level of the surface of your skin or inward.

 Dissosiation can be thought of as the opposite of interoception. It's a lack of bodily awareness or a removal of one's conscious experience from one's bodily experience and awareness. 

 About breath. You inhale more than you exhale - you become more active, you exhale more than you inhale - you calm down. 

   **Space-Time-Bridging** practice description and instruction. 

 It balances interoception and exeroception. It balances interoception and dissosiation and it crosses the various time domains that the brain can encompass using vision. Ideally you would do this outside or at a window, but what you do is essentially close your eyes.

 **You close your eyes** and you **focus your attention either on yor trird eye center(space behind the eyes) or your breathing** and you try put 100% of your perceptual awareness onto your breathing or on your third eye center **for the duration of three breath**. So you trying to be for 100% interoceptive.

 Then **you open your eyes**, **you focus on the surface of your body someplace**. I find that holding out of my hand at sort of arm distance and focusing on palm of my hand and focusing there visually. So im splitting my attention now between my hand and I'm also going to pay attention to me breath for the duration of three full inhales and exhales while also focusing on my hand so **you splitting interoception and exteroception as best you can 50/50**.

  Then **you subsequently look at some location in your immediate enviroment, maybe 10,15 feet away** and you focus your attention on that location while also splitting your attention so that you are still paying attention to your breathing. You **do that for the duration of three breaths**, but now you are in exteroception and interoception.

 **Then you focus your attention at some distance further away, maybe the furthest distance you can see**. Now this is why it's useful to do out of a window or on a balcone or outdoors. You focus on the furthest point, maybe a horizon, some furthest point **for the duration of three breaths** while also paying attention to your breathing and sort of imagine a bridge between the two if you find it to be challenging to focus on both. 

 And then, and this is where it can be a little tricky, but then what you actually focus on is the fact, and this is not an imaginary thing, this is a fact that you are a tiny spec on this big ball that's floating out in space, right? The earth that's floating out in space. And you **try and focus on your three breaths while also aclnowledging that you are a small body, literally, on this very seemingly large body The Earth**, but that's floating in a much larger, larger, expasive place. The universe. And you **do that for three breaths**. And then you close your eyes and you go right back into interoception and you do that for three breaths. 

 For measurable results, it is enough to at least do this for 3 minutes per day.

I had good trips, but found I got no more of an experience than what I got through meditation. A friend taught me TM several years go. He was an old Vietnam Vet and later a hippy. 

So, I'm meditating today and it's pretty normal. Lots of lights. Calmness. A sense of joy and relaxation. And after five or so minutes repeating my mantra, I get to my usual state of what I can only describe as stillness and as close to no thinking as you can get. 

All of the sudden. I have no bodily sensation. And what I experienced next was what people who have NDEs describe. I had a profound sense of joy, calmness, and love. I looked back on my own body for a moment and say my cat looking at me, looking at my body. 

I'm a rational guy. I have a degree in Biochemistry. Work in Information Technology. And I'm a retired paramedic. I'm a farmer.

We suffuse the future with hopes and dreams, but its reality is unknown. Any given moment could be our last, and that is true for everything.

379,My Meditation Journey," 

Throw away account for anonymity

Hi!  
It has been a few weeks since I (26M) started meditating ""seriously"" using Sam Harris app ""Waking up"" (which I find amazing btw).  
For the background story, I have always been disconnected from my emotions. To the point where for a long time I thought I was kind of ""emotionless"".  
Turns out, I am a hyper-sensible profile (therapist's talk), and I only walled everything because I never learned how to deal with it.  
Meditation has always fascinated me, but my ADHD ass never sat on it.  
As I have been taking my first steps into this inner world, I understood more things about myself than in my whole life. and I am a mess, depressed to the bone. The silent, background kind of depression.  
I feel that I progress every day in my meditative capabilities. But I feel like every time I dive into consciousness, I discover this ocean of negative emotions that overpowers me. For the first time in my life, I felt ""actively"" and deeply depressed. I feel like every time I come closer to myself all I see is darkness. It feels like every time I emerge from a meditation session, I'm soothed and relaxed, but I am later caught up in sadness. I have the impression that meditation half-opened a door and darkness is leaking from there all day long. I can feel this continuous flow of negative energy.  
I cried more in the last few weeks than in the previous decade.  
And it feels like all I have been talking about to my fianc√©e lately is how depressed and f\*\*ed up I am. She is the most loving, supportive, and sweetest person ever, but I can't help to think that I am fedding her up, as I am also tired of being redundant. It is the first time in our relationship that I've put myself in a vulnerable state, as I would rather be the caretaker. It just sucks feeling like shit.  
Sorry to vent here. But I am trying to get out of my mind the idea that meditation makes me more depressed and I would love to read your insights

Two nights ago, a spirit guide suggested that I go on a Mississippi River cruise on a paddlewheel steamer. I duly went there. As I was going up the gangplank, I met Captain Andy, a character from the musical ""Showboat"". He smiled, and asked if I would like to use Rhett Butler's cabin. I said, ""Yes, but Captain Butler won't be joining me!"" Of course, I fell asleep before even getting onboard. The next morning, my husband and I went out for breakfast. There was a schizophrenic man on the sidewalk. He was gesticulating oddly, and talking to invisible people. I felt nothing but sympathy. Eventually, I left the restaurant alone. The man was still on the sidewalk. As I went by, he said, very clearly, ""Did you use Rhett Butler's cabin?"" I was astonished, but kept on walking. How was this possible? Did he read my mind? If so, he went very deep, because I wasn't thinking about the meditation. Was he a spirit guide, or angel? The thing that disturbs me most is that it makes me wonder if our private meditations aren't really ""private"". Are there meditation voyeurs who spy on where we go in our minds, and what we do?

397,"Meditation can be an extremely dangerous tool for individuals who have survived intensive and continuous trauma throughout their lives. I am a survivor of the adverse effects of meditation, and I am posting to inform others of the dangers that can surface through practice.","Hi all,

First and foremost, I have been severely abused throughout my entire childhood and young adult life; anxiety and depression have been integral to my being, since I was in middle school. A friend of mine recommended to me that I begin practicing mindful meditation, in efforts to help alleviate my symptoms of anxiety and to aid my sleeping problems. 

I began practicing mindful meditation last year, in the month of October. The first month was life changing for myself. For the first time in my existence, I was able to genuinely be at ease. I would break down in tears out of pure joy to see how I could now live such a more fulfilling, present life without having to struggle with my anxiety. 

My life turned on itself in December, where immense pain would surface in my core; a pain that I would describe as someone gripping your stomach while simultaneously stabbing it, that would arise every 5-10 minutes. My anxiety heightened ten-fold, where I couldn't even step foot outdoors without falling apart. I would completely disassociate and depersonalize whenever I would simply walk to the corner store, or attempt to go grocery shopping. I had no idea what was happening to me. I knew meditation was the instigator for these feelings arising, so I continued practicing meditation, which was recommended to me, [in this post I created on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/stkeme/extreme_depression_obsessive_thought_loops_after/). I continued to practice, which further worsened the arising, stored trauma within my system, and my anxiety drove me to insanity, where I had to get professional help to keep myself safe.

I attempted to kill myself three times this past year, due to me not being able to handle and process the amount of trauma I was reliving every single day. 

Meditation surfaced stored trauma that I completely blocked out to protect myself, all at once, which completely altered my mental state. I have been a severe drug addict in my younger years, I have been physically, mentally and verbally abused by my parents and ex-girlfriend, and I was reliving all of the horrid memories that I tried so hard to escape from. I would feel lashes on my skin from simply hugging people. I lost communication with all friends and family as I was unable to even think let alone speak to others. I would wake up screaming with terror multiple times throughout my nights in the past.

I then sought help. I reached out to my therapist and she told me I needed to see a psychiatrist immediately. I was then diagnosed with complex PTSD and abnormal OCD, which meditation triggered. I am now on three different medications to simply keep me grounded, but hopefully I will get off of them with more time.

Mindful meditation can be a wonderful tool, but one's experience with it is extremely subjective. Every single human being's psyche is so different from one another. For those who have suffered the darkest days of hell, for those who have pulled themselves out of the trenches of true despair and darkness, it can cause those days to surface and it can destroy a human being if they're not strong enough to pull themselves through. 

Please, do not respond to this post informing me that I have practiced meditation incorrectly or that I should have sought a professional teacher to begin my practice. I know that. I would've done that, but meditation is a commercialized, ready-made tool, where one can simply download an app or watch a youtube video and embark on their own, subjective and personal journey with the practice.

Please, if you are a survivor of trauma like myself, be aware of the adverse effects of meditation. If you are currently experiencing symptoms like what I described, or feel like your entire mental state is falling apart, to the degree that you don't know what is real and what isn't, please reach out to me. 

We all deserve so much love. All I wanted to do was to improve my quality of life, hence why I began my practice. Meditation through me into the darkest days of my life, and I am on a life-long journey to heal and repair myself from the amplified trauma that I have to survive through day by day. 

Survivors, you are not alone. With love, all.",yry6bl,151,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yry6bl/meditation_can_be_an_extremely_dangerous_tool_for/,meditation

399,Bad days and good days,"Hi y‚Äôall! Some background - I‚Äôve been sitting on and off for a few years now and more recently, in the past 4 months, I‚Äôve had a more consistent sitting practice of 30 minutes to an hour every day. In sitting I usually focus on the sensations of my breath for the first 30 minutes, then do open awareness for the next 30 minutes. I also throw in some self compassion meditations as well.

I‚Äôve been noticing fairly large mood swings day to day. Some days I wake up feeling great, ready to face whatever challenges arise. This is accompanied by a feeling of lightness, ease and relaxation. Other days I wake up feeling tight, frustrated, angry, closed off and anxious. These feelings mostly persist throughout the day.

I will say that I definitely have more good days now that I‚Äôve been sitting regularly, but it seems to be a double edged sword in the sense that the bad days seem more frustrating, especially after a good day. And I‚Äôm also much more aware of the feelings of contraction or expansion when they occur - I just feel a bit helpless when it comes to the feelings of contraction.

Writing this in noticing how much I‚Äôm using the words ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù which maybe can point me in a direction. But I was just curious how others handle this feeling of expansion and contraction.

400,Confronting past trauma or negative memories during meditation...then what?,"I've heard many people say that during a 10 day meditation retreat or during a deep meditation session that they were able to confront and free themselves from past negative memories or traumas...I was hoping someone could explain to me how exactly.

My confusion is this: 

My understanding of letting go of negative emotions  ( from reading books such as Letting Go, The Sedona Method and The Untethered Soul ) is to let the memory come up and then to simply feel and observe the emotion/memory with equanimity and without judgement until it eventually runs it's course ( and leaves your body in a sense )...the memory is still there however it no longer triggers you into a negative emotional state and you are free.  HOWEVER...my understanding of meditation, like vipassana for example, is to focus on your meditation object ( breath or body scan ) and when thoughts or memories come up you are supposed to simply acknowledge them but then re-focus on your meditation object ( your breath or your body ) and let that memory/emotion simply slip away.  

 So which one is it?  I understand that past memories good and bad will eventually come up during meditation but am I to sit with the memory and emotion and ""feel"" it out ( essentially making the memory/emotion my meditation object ) OR...am I to acknowledge the memory and quickly refocus on my breath / body scan and let that memory drift away?

&#x200B;

401,An attempt at an unbiased Meditation FAQ,"**What is meditation?** It's connection with the present. It's awareness. It's letting go into the moment.    


**What is this moment?** Ever changing. No two moments are ever the same. Everything is impermanent.    


**How do we meditate?** We practice. We either begin to take in everything from moment to moment, or we begin to reign the mind into observing one single, ever changing thing (like the breath) and then once we achieve that, we take in everything. Or we label the things we are aware of from moment to moment to cease judging and attaching to our experiences and to strongly notice what we are noticing in a given moment. Any practice that brings us closer to nonjudgmental awareness in the present is a good one.    


**Why do we meditate?** We all start meditating for some reason, whether it's for the long list of health benefits, to seek truth, to experience a different reality, or to prove that we are more spiritual than anyone else.  As our practice develops and we have a rock solid and consistent practice, we become wholly convinced that the meditative path is for us, we let go of our reasons, and just show up to the practice, earnest and intentional, for its own sake. We keep a beginner's mind, as we don't know where this journey will take us or what will unfold from one moment to the next.  We watch ourselves transform through the practice in ways we never imagined, and we don't resist it.    


**How much should I meditate?** The most important thing is that you practice every day. If you only want to meditate to relax a bit, then any time you want to meditate is fine. But if you want more, than you need a consistent practice. Start with 5-10 minutes or 2 minutes if necessary. When you feel confident in the practice, begin increasing up towards 20 minutes. 30 minutes, 45 minutes. That much may seem impossible right now, but this may be because you are wasting so much time in unawareness that you don't even know how much time you really have. More important than how much time you spend meditating is the intention and diligence you bring into the practice. There's no need to rush as the practice is lifelong. Go at your own pace.

&#x200B;

**Should I meditate in daily life too?** Bring your seated/lying down practice into your daily life. Carry the weightlessness that is the fruit of your practice as long as you can throughout your day. Notice what things you do that lead to unawareness and drop them.",yskrjj,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yskrjj/an_attempt_at_an_unbiased_meditation_faq/,meditation

417,what do you have to tell me about dropping all eforts?,"I've been searching for this person, today specially. It drove me crazy. I went places and thought I'd find him there but always felt like I just missed him. Or when I stayed somewhere and didn't choose to move, I miss him again because if I would have move, I would have found him. 

Now I'm back home sitting on a bench in fron of the building and I don't wanna move anywhere. Anymore. 

Why the fuck should I chase, what makes me believe I will ever find him if I do

I will always miss him. Unless I find him in myself and stop looking outside. That's when I'll stop needing him. 

But then, will I ever find the physical manifestation of him? I know he's in the same city. 

What should I do. Please, I need your Light

I am about to just drop doing anything for the whole weekend and just stay home, maybe eat once a day. I'm tired. I'm done. I don't need him anymore. I need myself. I need my self love. I need to be happy. 

I feel like quitiing everything: university, keep rejecting my parents and stay in this appartment until the end of this month when I won't have money to pay anymore. Then, leave because I have no choice. 

I want to drop all efforts and I want life to push me in the right direction. Without me trying. I am done.

And I want this telepathic connection to end. It keeps pushing me and telling me to go places. I'm done moving. I stay here. I won't even go to university anymore. 

I just wanna wait for him here. If he doesn't find me, I'll become homeless. I'm not moving one finger anymore

I want to not care anymore about finding him. I know he is searching too

I wanna freaking drop the search. And feel free. Free to love myself, able to without any man

Able to take care of myself and stand up for myself and chase my dreams. I just asked for help from someone. 

I just asked for reunion

If we are meant to be together, why is the Universe keeping us appart


All that mattered that I heard was him saying he can't wait to hug me and lift me up in joy. I saw that happening. I saw him cry and laugh and tear and burn and shake. I don't know what to do


I just feel him closer and closer everyday. In the physical reality. I see him in everyone. I know he's here, close


I planned today to meet my twin flame. I am now sitting without my twin flame. I don't know anymore. I was sure I'm gonna have him. I even told my groupmates that I'm gonna bring him with me next week at a gather. 

I planned and it got destroyed by Universe. 

All plan is bullshit. I don't wanna play anything anymore ever again. Nothing I plan sticks and offers the result I expect

I'll get right into it. I meditated, surprisingly short. I had to stop my thoughts which wasn't easy, almost like a fight. But as i managed it. Something beautiful and incredible happened. I felt a strong energy above my head and I intuitively pushed it slowly down my body till my coccyx. As it arrived there, i felt a strong energy curled back up my head and above,  and intruduced a a explosion of light filling up the room. 
The time literally stoped for a while and left me with a intens sensation, that can't be explained different than an orgasm. Better than anything i ever experienced in my life. But by far, leaves an orgasm behind. and I heard a loud ""gong"" clinging.  And i saw everywhere geometrical structures of light (in my case yellow or golden and green) everywhere around me, like forming in continuously changing beautiful patterns around the materia, around you, your body, the room. When it was dark, i still could see everything, cause the structures where forming the material things. I could literally see in total darkness.
I could make the Materia also completely invisible when i concentrated on it and just saw the world transparent and made out of nothing then these beautiful living web of Lightstrings. 
I felt a strong moving energy field around me and I still realized a big light bulb above my head. I looked at a painting from Kandinsky later on and a whole dimension opened up in there, i saw it like a 3-dimensional movie telling a story through different layers till a big final. 
This was a bit different then fixing my concentration on a white wall, it became a 3dimensional ""story"" or visions, i saw things, almost like a video.. The geometrical structures, this web of energy, formed these ""videos"". These structures formed figures and worlds and more. Everything you can imagine.
I knew this web already from different, drug intruduced happenings in my past. But never through a deep meditative state, and never that special, clear and complete. 
This might sound crazy, but i felt like a very powerful and wise entity. Shining so bright, so connected, full of wisdom and powerful. 
The only thing I know and remember for sure is that i activated the two pyramids that are inside each other, turning in the opposite direction, cause i saw it with closed eyes like a vision. 
Also i felt all the time the presents of energies like people, that felt like they are hear , taking care, protecting me. I felt there presents and they showed as parts of my thoughts, cause any thought there, was information, spoken with care, very poetic and guiding. 
I felt illuminated in the true sense. Even that after some beautiful  hours of discovery, i fall asleep and woke up as this Human, that i am and stayed with the memory and sensation of that day. 

There, of course, happened much more things, but this is the most important.

I posted this here, cause i hope to find people that might have made some similar experience or might understand a little bit what happened to me and could help me with some topics, some clue words,  i could use to do some research. 

Or to help others, i am happy to answere questions and I like to help. Go deeper in things you want to know more precised. Just feel free to ask me. 

- i personally believe i activated my light body, the merkaba cause of my vision.

- I never found anything about these geometrical structures made out of yellow and green light. 

- Kundalini awakening might have been a part of that 

Greetings from Geany and thank you for reading. I am glad I found the trust in myself to talk about it, cause as you can imagine.

427,Meditation releasing suppressed negativity,"I have been meditating off and on since puberty. 
Over lockdown I meditated daily and found myself more irritable and negative. I feel that meditation is opening me to the negative emotions and thoughts I suppress during my day to day life. 
I find meditation useful for coping with stresses I experience, but struggle with it due to this release of negativity which I don't feel like I have the time or mental capacity to deal with. 
I'm on antidepressants, but do not have a therapist or any talk with a professional, is this maybe a way of dealing with this?
Wanting to know if there's a way I can meditate purely for my stress and depression without unearthing all my struggles that I don't have the time to deal with every day.

I'm currently suffering from severe panic attacts that go together with stomach pains on daily basis.
My worst nightmare is being locked up somewhere or totally surrounded by people.

Since i sought help for this (Reiki) my healer told me if the fear comes to stay with it, meditate on it, and breathe. And to my surprise this actually worked!! Togther with self-Reiki for the pains I was actually able to make it disappear. I was so happy!!
I finally understood that you have to let go of the resistance.

But since a few days its back. This afternoon after a good meditation in the woods, I got back to ""society"" and my fear was just trough the roof. Eventhough i concentrated on it, i feel like it creeped back up on me.
I just had to wait in a stupid waitingroom at the vets and it was living hell. Had to go outside twice. 
Even hours later i still have thoughts like, why can't i just act like a grown up. Why do i always have to do this. and I feel so much shame.

450,meditation to freedom,"Meditation to break us free from our ruts. It seems a staple to this human journey to get stuck in ruts. A powerful undercut to this getting stuck (platueing/complacency) is to meditate. I think when we live by routines we are forcing it. I think that through such mechanistic behavior, life becomes dull.(boring/uninteresting). 
I think its important to mix it up. We can utilize meditation as a tool to help free us from monotony. Meditate to help us keep things mixed up. This is also an accepting of change rather than resisting. I think it is a neat idea that I read from Alan Watt's autobiography , that meditation should be medicinal rather than dietary. Although, mostly using meditation as celebration. The difference here being that I won't meditate in any sort of routine anymore. I will never again have a schedule for my meditation. I will keep things more mixed up in life than that. I will try to avoid making any plans the night before. I will wait for the next day and see how I feel during the moment and then act from there. I will let my meditations arise more spontaneously. 

I've made previous use of daily affirmations. It certainly helped me at those times to help detatch myself from the story I was telling myself and to the affirmations were telling me a new story. I loved reading these powerful quotes daily. What I'm trying to express next is that while this sort of planning was helpful, it was also in subtle ways, offensive to myself. In general, we should not be going in the direction of treating ourselves as robots or as zombies. We need to move in the direction of being a human being. Perhaps you have found yourself in a rugged situation as I had and feel the need to train yourself like a dog at first. I only ever jokingly said that I would take myself on a walk or exercise myself like a dog. And also our basic food needs work in this manner. But there's no need to be so authoritarian with yourself. So mean and controlling. I think all forcing, controlling, predicting and general thinking you know the whole story, is offensive to our true self. 

So included any routine. Don't treat yourself like you're a robot! Expect to be a mess hahhaha and react accordingly. Be in the moment! I invite you these waters are where it's at. It's just very lonely especially because everyone else either lives in the future or the past.

Relaxing is a subtle art. You can fidget yourself to death. Or you could not.

454,Meditation & Anxiety ‚Äì study and advice,"Good News: **Meditation works as well as a popular drug to reduce anxiety**.

Notice, though, that this study involved ""**patients who took an intensive eight-week mindfulness meditation program**."" Specifically, they learned ""**Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction**, or MBSR, an approach developed more than 40 years ago by Jon Kabat-Zinn and based on the principles of meditation established in Buddhist vipassana meditation.""

In other words, these study participants were NOT people who randomly heard about something called meditation, and that it might be good to do, and who then decided to try on their own doing something that they thought might be meditation, in hopes that it might magically make everything better in a few days or even weeks. **These study participants were taught, by qualified teachers, how to do a specific type of meditation that has been specifically designed to help reduce unmindful stress**.

[https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/11/09/1135211525/anxiety-medication-meditation-lexapro](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/11/09/1135211525/anxiety-medication-meditation-lexapro)

Far too many people who post on r/Meditation are obviously trying (sort of, more or less) to do something that they imagine might be meditation, with little if any clue about what meditation is, let alone having any understanding that there are many types of meditation, only a few or one of which might actually be appropriate for them to learn and practice. If you try to invent your own meditation practice ‚Äì without being taught, without understanding what meditation is and is not, without really knowing anything about meditation ‚Äì it is highly unlikely that you will come up with something that will be of great benefit to you. As it states in the linked article: ""**If you want to take it seriously, you've got to get a teacher**.""

Lots of folks here are using meditation apps, however, as is noted in the article: ""I really don't think apps are going to provide the same benefit as having in-person training. ... The benefit of having a meditation teacher is that you can ask questions.""

Note that MBSR (used in the study) is not necessarily the only type of meditation that can help deal with anxiety, it's just the type they used for this study. Similarly, there are various types of meditation that are best suited for helping a person deal with other issues, or do specific types of inner work, including spiritual work. No one type of meditation is good for everything. Also, although meditation is a powerful and wonderful practice, not everything can be accomplished by doing meditation. 

My suggestion is that any beginner really interested in learning how to meditate should find a teacher to work with. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people who do meditation or meditation-like practices and call themselves teachers, even though they are now well qualified to teach. So, it can be challenging to find a good teacher ‚Äì especially one who might be good for you ‚Äì who can help you learn a method most appropriate for you. Not everything that is called meditation will necessarily actually be meditation, or be a practice that is most appropriate for you. Trying to learn meditation from a book or a video or even online is not the same as working in-person with a teacher.",yqzeot,13,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yqzeot/meditation_anxiety_study_and_advice/,meditation
455,Samatha Meditation Instructions in Brief,"Lots of people on this site seem to be looking for basic instructions on how to meditate. I offer the following on Samatha Meditation. The Buddha taught Samatha\~Vipassana. He introduced these as complementary aspects of meditation. And he said that one can start with samatha, or start with vipassana, or develop them concurrently. He, himself, started with Samatha. So did I.

Here are some instructions, broken into the stages (as I see them) that one goes through.

=================== 1st Stage ========================

1. If you've been busy and feel a little amped up, then take a few minutes to unwind a bit before going to your sitting space.
2. Shut off distractions like your phone, music or videos, and have people (and even pets, if that is practical) stay out of your practice space while you're practicing.
3. Move to your sitting space, get into your meditation posture. Relax. Start your timer (for beginners twenty minutes is a good minimum, but within a month or so work up to at least forty). Close your eyes, and don't look at the timer until it goes off.
4. Restrict the heart/mind's wanderings gradually, in stages. For roughly five minutes, just direct your attention to exploring sensations in your body. If sounds or thoughts or words appear your awareness, just bring the attention back to body sensations. Don't apply much effort yet. Just be a bit interested and poke around and see what your body feels like. Relax any tensions you find.
5. Restrict the heart/mind's wanderings a bit more. Now narrow the attention to just one sensation: the breath. Simply *feel* the breath sensation--at the point the breath contacts your nasal area most prominently--and *feel* the duration of each in-breath and each out-breath becoming shorter and shorter and shorter. Keep doing this until the duration is a fraction of what it was when you started this step.
6. Note: As soon as you notice any distraction, anything that is not breath sensation, words in the mind, thoughts, daydreaming, awareness of a body feeling, sounds, whatever, just drop it; Turn your attention away from the distraction and reapply it to the breath.
7. Continue to maintain your attention on *feeling* the breath sensation at the point of contact, but now add a bit more effort. Try to sustain it there, second by second, as the in and out breath cycles through its various stages: pausing, stirring, increasing, peaking, subsiding. I'm not saying to note these various parts of the cycle. I'm saying to try to be with the breath sensation it continuously, through the entire cycle, cycle after cycle, without a break.
8. When you start to notice a shift in the clarity and steadiness of your attention such that your attention is settling on the breath and resting there, breath by breath, and there is a pleasant feeling of quietude and relief... Welcome to what I call the First Stage - ""Settling."" I call it this because at this stage the attention actually starts *resting* on the breath (in both senses of the word).

Note 1: Now your job is to try to figure out how to make your heart/mind get to this stage again, in another sit. It might not happen again for some days. But once it does, you'll recognize that this is a stage you can get to. Then your job becomes to learn how to get to this stage most every time you sit. Caution: it can take a while, months. Once it is happening regularly, your heart/mind will begin dropping down to the next level - Stillness.

Note 2: Don't chide yourself, when you drift off. It's going to happen a lot. So make peace with that reality. It will settle down after a lot of practice. Don't disrupt the settling process by introducing the very powerful distractions of irritation and frustration.

Note 3: It helps to learn to perceive the breath sensation experience as pleasurable. Just being with the breath sensation is restful, simple, uncomplicated, a relief, rejuvenating. Give the heart/mind the experience of pleasure hanging with the breath, and it will naturally stay with it more steadily.

In my experience, you don't get beyond the first stage for quite a while. Only after you've become quite adept at getting to the 1st stage most every time you sit does the process go deeper. Fortunately it is a very pleasant stage at which to be practicing.

&#x200B;

====================== Second Stage =====================

Get to the first stage.

1. Stay there and be with the breath so steadily, and so continuously, that there just isn't enough space left in your attention for discursive thought to arise.
2. As you develop the skill associated with step 1, your breath will become more and more shallow, and your rate of breathing will become slower and slower. The brain normally uses up to 20% of your energy, but your heart/mind is so still now that it doesn't need so much energy or oxygen. Your breath can become so subtle that you start losing awareness of it. It may seem like it is actually disappearing. Don't be alarmed. This is a good sign. And you're still breathing.
3. Inner chatter has long since disappeared. And in a while your heart/mind will drop down to this state, it will start to feel very, very quiet, and very, very still inside. There are no words in the mind. The mind is not moving around generating ideas and thoughts. It is deep stillness. It is a delightful feeling, dripping with a sense of inner ease and well-being, and there is much greater clarity in the heart/mind. This I regard as the second stage.Like before, in my experience you will not past this stage until you are adept at getting into the second stage most every time you sit.

&#x200B;

===================== Third Stage ==========================

Here you do nothing but remain in silence, for some time, and be contented to remain there. It is important not to try to get to this stage. Rather, you just stay in stillness and be contented to stay there in that wonderful feeling of stillness.

After quite a bit of practice in stillness, a feeling will bloom in the heart/mind. It is a very pleasureable feeling. It is the best feeling I know. It comes on in a few seconds at most, but can take a long time to peak, and can last forty minutes or longer. Interestingly, as you get to this stage a bunch of times, you can start to detect the glimmerings of this feeling in the background even when you aren't yet in this stage. It seems to remind the heart/mind of a freedom that is attainable to some degree even off of the cushion. This feeling is superior to the others you know, both in terms of its quality and how long it can go on for. It feels like a strong physical pleasure, but in the mind. This is what I regard as the third stage of meditation, and I call it ""rapture,"" because that is what it can feel like. It is euphoric at times.

This stage, experienced many, many times, has a big effect on your life. I consider it the ""tipping point,"" in meditation because if you get to this one you will keep practicing for the rest of your life. Also, your tastes will start to change. Things that you used to see as pleasurable will seem less interesting, and as a mixture of pleasure and problems. 

* they cost money
* you have to work for them
* they can cause health problems.
* they can lead to addictions
* and they are a hassle to keep going, maintaining a string of them running, one after another,  buying relief, one ""hit"" at a time, like an addict. And it's like being on a hamster wheel.
* And they just aren't as effective at improving the way you feel in any durable way by comparison with meditation.

Important ==> The effects of samatha always fade away after a few hours or somewhat longer. So they don't solve the problem inside. The idea is not to bury yourself in this type of meditation, and use it as a permanent escape. The Buddha himself called this a pleasant abiding, here and now, and he praised this type of meditation, but by itself it is not enough.

The idea behind Samatha is to use this meditation type to help clarify your heart/mind, to bring it temporarily to a state of not being emotionally dependent on anything for its well-being, a state of equipoise, and desirelessness and fearlessness so that the complementary practice of vipassana can do its work most effectively.

That's why he taught Samatha-Vipassana.

I myself am working on developing the next level, and I don't have a lot of experience with it yet, so I'll not say more at this point.

Hope this helps at least a few people.

Be well.

457,Difficulty feeling Metta in my heart,"Hi everyone,

I have been practising Metta for about 3-4 months. It has been a really amazing practice for me in helping me feel connected to myself, others and the world. However, I have a lot of trouble feeling Metta in my heart. When I meditate I can feel it flowing all around my body but I dont really feel it in my heart, my heart feels kind of closed off and distant.

I have difficulties with relationships and emotions from childhood/attachment trauma I would think plays a role here. Is it just a matter of patience or are there any exercises I could do to help feel the Metta in my heart?

471,"What does it mean to be ""spiritual?""","I was recently asked, ""When people say they are ""spiritual,"" what do they mean?""

I thought it was a brilliant question ‚Äî one that spiritual seekers themselves often don't stop to ask.

While there are countless practices, beliefs, traditions that fit comfortably under the heading ""spirituality,"" I think there's a simple answer to this question that unites them.

In short, to be spiritual is to seek connection with the spirit of the world.

OK. That's well and good. But what is the ""spirit of the world?""

To answer that, it's useful to distinguish between ""spirit"" and ""soul"" ‚Äî two words that are often used interchangeably.

Writers like John Welwood and Bill Plotkin define ""soul"" as the essence of an individual entity. On the other hand, ""spirit"" is the essence of the universe.

The spiritual landscape can be roughly divided into traditions that focus more on spirit or on soul.

Plotkin characterizes spirit as the upward path while soul is the downward path (though not in a negative way). Spirit is universal, transcendent, and is characterized by the upper world: the realm of light. Soul is personal, immanent, and is characterized by the descent inward to the essence of who we are: the intimate darkness.

While all religious traditions acknowledge both spirit and soul in some way, Plotkin argues that the dominant world religion focus on the upward path of spirit. This includes Buddhism, Abbrahamic traditions, Hinduism, Taoism, where the goal is to know, unite, or align with the universal essence.

By and large the earth-based, indigenous, animistic, magical, traditions emphasize the path of soul, where the goal is to descend into the earthy, watery depths to find there your true self. 

The traditions that focus on soul‚Äîthose that are earthy, natural, or ""dark""‚Äîhave been considered ""less than"" the spirit based traditions or literally demonized.

However, the movement upward and downward are really both a movement toward a central truth.

Whether our spiritual practice seeks to touch the universal spirit (the essence of reality) or our personal soul (the essence of ourselves) we are reaching for, and connecting with, the same thing.

In Hinduism, atman is considered both the universal soul and the soul contained in every individual.  


In Kabbalistic Judaism, each person carries a ""spark"" of the divine.

In Christianiy, the Kingdom of Heaven is said to be within.

The last thing to mention about spirituality that distinguishes it from philosophy (as it is generally understood today) is that spirituality doesn't seek to understand, it seeks to experience.

In the practice of philosophy, the tendency is to try to understand the world with reason, keeping it at a distance in order to maintain intellectual clarity and control.

In the practice of spirituality, the aim is to let the world wash over and through us, to achieve an intimate, felt experience of connection - or union - with reality.

To be spiritual is to seek connection with the spirit of the world, and thus enter fully into the heart of life.

‚ÄúGo within into your silence. Envision yourself entering a room. No one is in there but you. Suddenly, across the room, you perceive yourself as you really are, in your inner beauty. Allow yourself to make your acquaintance, tenderly, lovingly.
Now take yourself by the hand. Bring yourself back with you. Keep yourself close to you for the rest of your life. That being you have just met has been waiting for you to notice them throughout your entire life. And once you have noticed, once you have learned who you are (and it will take many such exercises; I urge you to do them at least once a day) you will begin to realize that it matters very little what anyone else thinks.

I'm making this post in the hope that someone has heard or seen it somewhere else, or perhaps even identify the name of the whole lecture

I started meditating maybe 5 years ago. I would practice on and off but never really committed to it every day for months on end. It helped to a degree but the emotions and negative thoughts were so loud and overwhelming.

Anyways skip forward a few years and life got a lot better. BUT it felt like my brains was still hard wired to be anxious and overthink because that was a defense mechanism growing up, trying to be perfect and be accepted..

So I have now dabbled with mushrooms twice and it‚Äôs been a life changing experience. I have never had that type of clarity and understanding. It was like i took a step back and could see my whole life on a projected screen and I was just viewing it objectively. I could put all the puzzle pieces together and understand where the insecurities and negative thinking patterns and anxiety came from. A lot of realizations to say the least.

The craziest/best part of the experience was truly understanding that we are consciousness or awareness. It‚Äôs like my awareness zoomed out 100x and I could just see my life and everything in it with such clarity. And I totally understand the term monkey mind now. Yours attentions wants to follow thoughts and jump from one thought to the next, but when you can catch yourself doing it and give your full attention to, let‚Äôs say, the music (Dark side of the moon) it was overwhelming to experience the music without any distractions (thoughts).

501,seeing through my closed eyes?,"Okay so I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask but it's happened during meditation as well so I assume you guys would know the best about it.

Anyway about 3~ months ago I first experienced this, when I was having trouble falling asleep, eventually when I think I was very close to actual sleep noticed that I could see, but I definitely knew that my eyes where closed. It kinda woke me up mentally so I tried opening my eyes, saw my room normally, closed my eyes again immediately after as I was very confused and saw nothing.

Now this has been happening more and more, usually right when I'm about to go sleep, when I've been lazy in the morning and stayed in bed until I can't sleep (and then some) and it's happened once or twice while meditating, in a very clear, non sleepy state of mind.

I've noticed it's not usually in color, if ever actually and if I'm able to realize what's happening without properly waking up it'll kind of fade away, like I'm loosing focus, sometimes it'll come back and then go again and when I'm able to ""study"" what I can see for long enough I always recognize it as my room but sometimes it'll be slightly different or I can only see where the center of my vision would be.

Finally, this has only happened once, but when my head was near the edge of the bed and I could ""see"" most of my room, I saw two white dots next to each other on the wall of my cupboard, everything else was in gray-ey blackish but the dots where clearly white, I opened my eyes and saw nothing that would maybe shine through my eyelids and this weird feeling that like my room itself was judging what I did next, like I was almost embarrassed and on edge but I've ""seen"" with my eyes closed since and no white spots.

Sorry for the long post I just really wanna figure out what could be happening, I find it quite cool when it's happening and wanna find out if I can ""practice"" it somehow.

502,Feeling the breath is so important.,"Been meditating daily, twice a day, for 25 minutes each time. I've entered my 9th week of daily meditation and it's been a game changer, honestly.

But lately I've realised that the most important thing to calm the mind is to feel the breath. I always count my breath to better know where my awareness is going. However counting became automatic, and I could see myself still keeping track of my breath while seeing my mind going somewhere else lol

Maybe this seems trivial and obvious, but it's very difficult for me to understand what it means to ""watch the breath"".

As soon as I started feeling my breath, feeling the sensation of the air coming in and out of my nostril my inner dialogue got cut in half. 

I'm watching the flow of the air everytime I start meditating, but I've realised that I've lost this ""sensation"" over time throughout my meditations.

Actually, the same thing happens to me if I start to focus on external sensations, like what I'm seeing or hearing. 

I've realised that there are sensations that I can experience through all of my senses, but they are separate from ideas and thoughts. It's so easy to mix the two. It's so easy to have an idea about anything that I forgot than things exist beyond my ideas and opinion about them.

Focusing on sensations beyond thoughts is what works for me, and I believe it's the key to inner peace. If I'm focused on the present moment, thus my sensations, I barely get any thought that arises. They do, but they quickly fade away. 

Which makes me wonder : If I'm entirely focused on the present, where are my problems ? When I don't think about my problems, where are they ? Do they even exist ?

505,"PSA, jumping to excessive meditation can be unhealthy","I'm going to say some things you definitely shouldn't believe just because some guy on the internet told you. Don't commit anything to your core beliefs, and probably just don't even listen to any of my ""facts"" if they're corrected by the comments section, or if the post is still fresh. 

With that out of the way, I've seen a number of posts lately about meditating for hours and hours, or taking up an entire day with it. For starters, I look at that as a yellow flag of lack of life balance. You really have *nothing* better to do with your day than, what is from a certain point of view, nothing? Nothing is absolutely something worth doing, but the time periods suggested are not mainstream yogic, buddhist, or similar practice, or even devout. See footnote A. 

I ran into a study awhile back where participants struggling with various mental health situations were prescribed daily meditation, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours... Meditation in excess of 30 minutes in this situation produced negative outcomes, up to and including hospitalization for psychosis. These were students new to meditation, this is certainly not true of everybody, but I suspect those here who *can* meditate more than 30 minutes in a sitting don't have to ask on reddit if it's a good idea. 

The path to enlightenment is not something that Reddit is going to find for you by encouraging you to spend ""all day"" in meditation. There's a fine line between meditation and catatonia. I've been down that path. I've been psychotic. I hadn't slept in like 4 days, and when I was lying in bed all night, my brain wasnt doing the brain stuff that brains are supposed to do during sleep. I thought I was doing some kind of miraculously discovered ""sleep"" thing, but all that was happening was my subconscious was doing cartwheels turning reality into the promised land. I jumped from no meditation to hours and hours of catatonia per day. Shit went downhill fast. 

I'd also like to address psychedelics for a moment. The experiences they can bring about can be immensely beneficial through introspection, and sometimes resemble hours and hours of meditation. But I don't think that's likely. Certainly, the altered state the drugs bring about is a contributing factor. 

Maybe I'm just not ready to hear the concept that this might be a good idea for anyone questioning that it might be, but please speak (type) if you think this might be the case. It's not going to send me to doing it, or anything like it, in the near future. I'll be alright. 

**Footnote A:** There are plenty of ""out there"" examples of these practices involving all sorts of weird things, including solitary gurus in the mountains doing nothing but food, water, and meditation, but another example of such practice was getting dehydrated as hell and walking around a bell in a circle, ringing it periodically, until you fall over dead, and your master knows the bell stopped ringing and comes to collect your body. Others included meditating one's self into oblivion, thus achieving a form of emtpiness that *could* be interpreted as contentment, but if you have a device connected to reddit, it's unlikely this can lead to a healthy life path.",ypztk7,7,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/ypztk7/psa_jumping_to_excessive_meditation_can_be/,meditation

513,Watching thoughts vs. Focussing on the breath,"I have been meditating every day for about 11 month (started on New Year‚Äôs Eve ;)) and I never really got my mind quiet or more quiet than before so far. It is more of a constant observing of my stream of thought. Which is really insightful and my concentration and happiness has gotten better nonetheless , but I never really hold my focus on the breath. Maybe because I don‚Äôt try to get rid of my thoughts and I don‚Äôt force my focus so much. If thoughts come I just observe them but I feel kind of stuck now, because that observing is all that happens. I still get  involved in the thoughts to a certain degree and i don‚Äôt really find peace. 

About my technique: I am doing mostly short sessions from 2-15 minutes.
During those sessions I count every thought (1,2,3) before i try to return to the breath whenever there is a pause. I started this so my thoughts don‚Äôt overwhelm me. It helps me to distance myself from them. 


Any suggestions on how to get ahead and improve? ;)

Meditation is an extremely powerful practice that if devoted to with consistency over several years will completely restructure your mind. Your entire stability with depend upon it because you will achieve elevated height of mental fortitude.

But that will happen with consistency. It does not matter if this time you couldn‚Äôt hold your attention. It does not matter if your mind is cluttery. It doesn‚Äôt not matter if you felt like it was a bad session. It does not matter if you are lost and wondering if you‚Äôre doing it right. Practice. Accept. Relax.

Meditation is a skill. It doesn‚Äôt matter if your trying to be a laser sharp genius or a beyond bliss Buddha it takes time to go up and learn how to go down.

Understand what you expect and throw it out! Let the experience be your guide not what you want! Our expectations are not reality and they are getting your way!

For me this is doing sports, working, spending time with my family. All good things, that are very important for my wellbeing. There was a time where I didn't enjoy these things. I got lucky and found the right strategy, which is when they became fun and something I love doing.

Now I still have several problems and a lot of them come from missing impulse control, getting stuck in a certain state of mind, feeling out of control, etc.  
I heard that meditation is supposed to help with these things.

I decided to try it out:
Did a free 10 days course in an App
It felt good, not great but good, so I decided to follow it up with listening to guided meditations on Youtube and in certain free apps.
After a while I felt bored, good feelings went away, it felt like a chore.  
I tried meditating for myself in quietness, for 2, 5, 10, 20 Minutes.
Resulted in me falling asleep or getting distracted.

The more I did it, the more I got annoyed of it. I didn't want to do this.
I heared it should help, but I didn't experience this.
So I stopped doing it.

After a while I did some sort of counseling, they suggested me a bodyscan audio guide.
It was quite long, starting from 15 minutes, ending in 40 minutes in the last episode.  
Same experience, in the beginning I loved it, I told myself to push through.
In the end I hated it and had to stop.

2 Years later, this year, I tried again.
Bought the another app, finished the beginner course, liked it.
Still, the more I go, the less I enjoy it.
Currently I'm once again at the point where I just want to stop.

I have a lot of activities that I clearly enjoy.
Journaling is nice, I plan my weeks, do sports, spent time with family, and so on.
But I haven't found the same enjoyment for meditation.  
Maybe it's the strategy, but I varied the exercises, duration, start time, etc.

Do you feel the same?
Do you have any advice?

But i also just had enough and wanted to go.
I think i came thinking after 10 days something magical would happen to me but after 5 days i was the same person and i knew id be the same person after day 10 so i didnt see the point in finshing just to prove something to my self. I knew i could of completed it if i just wanted to to prove somthing to my self because i had a honest talk with my self and i knew i could compete it but i thought whats the point if staying here 5 more days just to prove something to my self 

Also why do they say it dangerous to leave early? 
Another thing after leaving ive been googling vipassana ( i actually done no research before attending) ive seen some blogs and vids on youtube saying its potentially dangerous for some people some people go crazy , some people commit suicide afterwards ????

539,Meditation for anxiety and depression- What I did when nothing else worked,"  

&#x200B;

Hello everyone. I will try to keep this post clean, even though the entire journey has been anything but. I didn‚Äôt want to make a post until I found something that serves me well when it comes to meditation, but as of a couple of weeks ago, I can say my brain has changed enough that I feel this could help someone.

I‚Äôve been suffering from anxiety and depression ever since I can remember. Honestly, now that it loosened its grip (it did not go away, I‚Äôll make a post about it soon) on me, I can see how bad it really was. I‚Äôve tried and given up on meditation countless times. It was hard, it made me feel like crap, and most teachers went on and on about ending suffering, founding stillness in thought (maybe some of you guys can stop thought, I can‚Äôt), focusing on breathing et cetera. I won‚Äôt go into what did not work for me in detail. I‚Äôll just say, body scans, sitting cross-legged, just trying to breathe for 40 minutes, especially while I was living with someone else, with little to no privacy, did not help. I‚Äôm sure you can relate when I say that when you think it started helping, something bad happens, a stressor, a bad day at work, and you forget everything you do while you‚Äôre meditating, and you chastise yourself for reacting a certain way. You‚Äôre a damn yogi, you should be stoic and still and not let anything get you down. Right? So for us, who have to face a difficult daily life, with friends, family, co-workers, who have no time, no patience, who are fighting a losing battle with mental illness, how do we meditate every day and make it work for us? How did I do it?

**1. The basics are important but only as a ‚Äúgateway drug‚Äù**

Mr.Sam Harris made his Waking up app available for free during the pandemic. I went through the introductory course at a particularly bad period of depression brought along by very shitty circumstances. Looking back, I found guided meditations annoying even then, and I definitely should have waited for my depression to loosen its hold before starting anything. But it helped get the basics down. 

What I learned about mindfulness is that *it‚Äôs* *not about stopping thought*, meditation is a process of drifting off in thought and getting your attention back to an **anchor**. Quite early on I found I hated breath as an anchor (I later made peace with it, but not at first). I went from focusing on breath to something called choice-less awareness quite early on. Google is your friend here, it‚Äôs just focusing on what is there. 

 I would focus on sound, the feeling of air against my skin, or my seat against my butt. Sometimes I‚Äôd move my palms against any surface and feel it completely. If I didn‚Äôt feel like meditating that day, I‚Äôd take a shower and focus on basically all five senses; the feeling and taste of water, smell of shampoo, the way it looks, the sound of everything around me. In the beginning it is vital you snap yourself out of a reverie, if you are prone to overthinking, negative thoughts, etc, and you don‚Äôt have to do this by sitting cross-legged for an hour. Mindfulness is not about focusing on what feels good. It‚Äôs not about extreme focus either. It is focusing on what is there. 

I learned to love and work with my thoughts later, but for starters you have to connect your body to the present. You‚Äôd be surprised to find how much time you have spent in your mind because your body will feel fucking weird doing this. Like I said, if you can‚Äôt sit, try and find other ways to incorporate mindfulness. Take what works and discard what doesn‚Äôt. Don't listen to me. don't listen to other teachers. And start slow, I cannot stress this enough. If you try doing this for half an hour a day, from day one, you will quit. Make it into a game. Make it as effortless or as short as you need to. It‚Äôs a marathon, not a sprint. Later on, I will explain other things you can try now and feel ok (not better, not worse, but ok) almost immediately. But I just wanted to tell the story of how I started.

Let me know if you‚Äôre ready for part two since I think doing this in one go will be too long.",yohbqu,32,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yohbqu/meditation_for_anxiety_and_depression_what_i_did/,meditation
540,FAQ: Is it ok to meditate to sleep? Does meditation help with sleep?," A: Yes it is ok and yes meditation is beneficial to do right before bed.

Generally, meditation is a great practice for building mindfulness where being awake and alert (sitting in an upright position) is important for maintaining focus. Focus is needed to practice being aware of thoughts when they pop up and letting them go without judgement.

However, meditation does not have to be solely for exercising mindfulness. Meditating to calm the mind and body in the moment and bring the body to a relaxed state ready for sleep is also a valid and useful practice. Counting your breaths in slow, even inhales and exhales is a fantastic way to lower your heartrate and focus your mind away from stressful or preoccupying thoughts.

In addition to using meditation for sleep, I also recommend the following habits to getting to sleep more easily:

1. Avoid caffeine after 12pm.
2. Stop use of screens and engaging activities right before bed (videogames, intense movies, online news, studying, etc)
3. Keep room dark. Get a cheap eye mask to block any additional light entering your room.

553,My lessons from ‚Äúyou are not your thoughts‚Äù - I transformed my thoughts and did not try to give them up entirely,"Now I think many seasoned practitioners know that you are not your thoughts, you are the supreme awareness behind the thoughts. I first took this as a lesson that I have to go beyond my thoughts, let thoughts not flow. I later learned that I have to just sit and be aware of thoughts coming up and rising.

I realised I need thoughts everyday to direct my actions, to think, to work, to communicate, it is utterly impossible for me to have given up my thoughts and I feel like the idea of anyone being thoughtless and empty is bullshit. At least for us regular folk who work, have friends, families, etc and who can‚Äôt afford to spend an extended amount of time in meditation retreats.

But during my spiritual and meditation practice, my thoughts were completely transformed. Prior to this, I had a lot of self hatred, I‚Äôd feel so crushed and incompetent, I would call myself a loser, an embarrassment. But slowly over time, whenever I cringe back on memories, think about regrets, worry about the future - there is always the constant voice in my head who tells me ‚ÄúI love you and I am here for you. You belong here and you are loved. No matter what the world does to you, I will always love you‚Äù.

This has also extended towards others, giving compassion and kindness when I need to, thinking about the bigger picture, thinking about our common foundation, my perception of another human being or animal as a member of this Earth family. 

So this was my lesson. Meditation has helped me transform my thoughts from destructive self-hatred to a pure form of love. I‚Äôm still learning and there are many lessons to be learned as life goes on. I cannot give up my thoughts, but I think with enough practice, I can weather the storm inside the mind. 

I‚Äôm so grateful for everything and everyone I have in life, and the constant love that will never leave me.",ynpqe3,73,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/ynpqe3/my_lessons_from_you_are_not_your_thoughts_i/,meditation

I think the app has been somewhat useful, so I had been trying to incorporate some of the lessons today. For example, I tried to hear the sounds around me, and that was going pretty good. When I tried to do meditating through observing my surroundings, I felt like something was off. Everytime, I would look at a tree, rather than having a thought form, I would tell myself to look at it objectively. (The reason i wanted to look at it objectively is that when I would look at them before I would have thoughts such as how trees are not too different from other humans, and that bothered me a lot). Anyways, after telling myself that I should look at it objectively, it was so peaceful not having any thoughts. However, it became scary when I went to my local coffee shop to get some work done, and I literally could not focus at all. Like I was just there but my mind was slow and wasn't working and processing information as I usually like it.

580,how to combat sleepiness?,"I want to meditate all day and all night, I am constantly in that state and during activities, walking too but one thing puts a hold to it: sleep. Whenever I just sit and try to be in this state (when it's not an intense feeling like pain or anger) I just get so sleepy. I know I shouldn't sleep in that moment, in some moments specially but there's a voice in my head that sais ""just go to sleep, leave everything"". But then, I miss realisations and taking important decisions that might change the timeline I'm on. I feel that if I sleep I miss out. I had some nights in which I didn't sleep at all and I was full of energy. This weird feeling comes: after I get really really sleepy -at a point where I can't fight it anymore, I fall into this sleep unconsciousness for a bit and then something happens energetically that transmutes that sleepy energy and gives me a boost so I wake up after minute feeling so refreshed, full of energy and with new motivation, stronger. However, this doesn't allow me to get enough sleep and I'm feeling a bit afraid. I planted the desire to not need sleep anymore. Maybe it's coming true? I don't like to sleep. Feels like I'm loosing time. I want to always be conscious, awake and being magic. In this magic. I don't wanna miss a second of this life experience. By falling in that unconsciousness. 

I only like sleep when I feel there's nothing for me to realise. And that I can just be. But even then, I don't like sleeping more than a few hours. I'd rather be awake and on *watch* always. I wanna take in that Prana as much as I can and when I sleep, I can't. But I feel that, the more I feed on the Prana, the less sleep I need. 

So I guess I wanna eliminate the sleepiness totally from my experience.

582,"[jh√¢nas] What is the difference between ""feeling"" and ""knowing""?","Hi.

In the book ""Practicing the jhanas"", it is said that one should not simply ""concentrate on the breath by feeling it"" but that one should ""concentrate on the breath knowing it"".

But I don't understand what is the difference between the two. Indeed, I have the impression that when one concentrates strongly on feeling the breath, one is necessarily knowing the breath. I don't see how one could ""concentrate on the feeling of the breath"" without ""knowing the breath"".
This worries me because I may have misunderstood the practice.

The method taught in the book is that of Pa Auk.

Here are two excerpts from the book talking about meditation through the knowledge of the breath:

1/ FIRST EXTRACT : << Another method to develop concentrated awareness is to notice the length of the breath, long or short. This is not a mental evaluation but an aware knowing. It is also not ‚Äúnoting,‚Äù as in associating a word to the knowing. Simply, upon the in-breath, you know whether it is long or short. Upon the out-breath, you know whether it is long or short. As with counting, this can be dropped once concentration develops. >> ;

2/ SECOND EXTRACT : << We must remember that the actual instruction is to know the breath at the ƒÅnƒÅpƒÅna spot, not just to feel it. >>

My problem is that I feel that when we focus on feeling the breath, we are necessarily knowing the breath. So I don't see what the book is getting at by saying that we need to ""know the breath, not just feel it"".

Thanks in advance for your help.

583,How is it that some people complete a full 10 day Vipassana course and say they got nothing out of it?,"Not hating here.  Not calling anyone out or being snarky. I'm genuinely curious as I'm a few weeks away from my first 10 day retreat.

So I've read in several articles and in several sub-chats - people coming out of a 10 day silent retreat with little to no real effects.  Just the usual ""I felt more calm"" or ""I felt less stressed"" and they go on to say that ""but beyond that nothing drastic or eye-opening"".

I get it that everyone's experience doing a retreat will be highly personal to them and unique but one would think, or rather I'm thinking that anyone spending a whole ten days just meditating with no stimulus and nothing to do but go inwards - that this in itself would change your whole way of thinking/living...at least for the 10 days.  How could it not? The retreat life is so far from everyday life that you're 'forced' into a different state...right?  I mean, no electronics, no entertainment, no stimulus, heck, no talking or eye contact. You're literally forced to dive deep into your mind and explore and if your lucky to heal as well. And 10 days of doing nothing but this is rather long (relatively speaking)...and hard.   But for someone to come out after 10 days and say ""ho hum, its back to normal life I go""....were they doing it wrong?  Is there a certain mindset one must have in order to reap any benefits from the course?   This is interesting to me.

584,You know that weird half-asleep state you experience sometimes? I had an aha moment there this morning.,"I was in that surreal dreamy state in which you're aware and have pseudo-control, but not actually awake yet. In the dreamy state, I was able to reject thoughts that were ""worldly."" What I mean is that I remember thinking things like ""is it going to be windy today"" and ""do I hear a dog moving,"" and just simply reacting with a ""nah, don't care."" By not latching onto these thoughts or not giving them credence or not identifying with them - whatever you wanna call it - I was able to prevent myself from waking up. 

What finally woke me up was an intrusive thought about work that felt too ""real"" to ignore, I guess. It was more of a worry than a thought, so when it popped up, it was harder for me to shrug off. Once my brain had acknowledged that I ""should"" pay attention to this thought, it was game over and I was fully awake. 

I've heard many times that identifying with a thought is what gives it power, but it never really hit home until I was able to flick it away in my dreaminess. It seems pretty obvious now that I'm writing it out, but for whatever reason I didn't have that resolute sureness that the key to controlling any unwanted thoughts is to not latch onto them, reject them, and most importantly to not identify with them. Now I guess we'll see how much easier said than done this will be. üòÖ

592,The cleansing breath,"A good way to start each meditation session is with a cleansing breath. 

Simply breath out slowly and completely through the mouth while bending forward with the hands on the knees or on the floor in front of one‚Äôs seat. Tightening or pursing the lips while exhaling puts some additional pressure on the lungs, which opens up the multitude of tiny sacs that are essential to efficient use of the air and revitalization of the body.

Continue to exhale slowly and calmly until it seems that no more air will come out ‚Äî then blow three short bursts to get every last bit of air expelled. Follow with a deep inhalation through the nose. Or, if one has the genetically inherited ability, breath in through a wet tongue rolled up like a straw, to sooth and heal the lungs with moisture.

To heighten the positive effect of the cleansing breath, imagine all the toxins, both physical and mental, being blown out with the outbreath, along with distracting thoughts and negative emotions ‚Äî which is essentially what takes place with this simple breathing exercise.

Normally most people breath with only about a third of their lungs, or even less. The remainder of the lungs accumulate toxins and other contaminants that eventually degrade the lungs, causing various health problems later on. A vigorous expulsion of the air in the lungs not only cleanses and detoxifies, but also stimulates and de-stresses the entire body/mind system. It is especially recommended for smokers or after exposure to dust or fumes, and for those with lung or breathing problems.",ymy5mh,9,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/ymy5mh/the_cleansing_breath/,meditation
593,Mind helps us make sense of thoughts and there is more to it,"There is a person. An empty person. The person never received any thought.

The person receives their first thought: ""I'm the best of all"". The thought will have an effect.

After a while, the person receives a second thought: ""I'm the worst of all"". The thought will have an effect proportional to the impact of the first thought the person had.

If the first thought was received in a very personal manner, the second thought is gonna bring misery. If the first thought was 'observed' for what it is: just a thought, the second thought will also be 'observed', and the person will not be bothered.

Mind is the intensity with which we identify with a thought.

There must always be some mind: healthy attachment to certain thoughts, like one's name. If someone calls one by 'one's name, one will take it personally, and respond back.

If someone calls one NOT by one's name, no attention will be paid.

If the attachment with the name or the identity gets stronger, anytime one sees a person whose 'identity' is more or less than one's, one will get the effects of it. It might be different emotions, like pride or jealousy, etc.

&#x200B;

Do we control our thoughts? Do we think what we want to think? Maybe, there is an answer to it, or maybe not.

Meditation, any kind of meditation, helps us be aware of our thoughts, of our attachment to those thoughts, and with the passage of time, through the power of observance, the mind becomes smaller. A thought comes & a thought goes. The self isn't bothered by it.

One gets angry; one observes the thoughts of anger, and down the road, the anger settles.

One gets angry, one puts too much focus on the thoughts of anger, and even though the anger settles, one has been trapped in the mind for some time, and the mind was powerful.

Observing one thought at one time...

599,Practicing while doing physical exercise?,"(Did a search, couldn't quite find what I was looking for)

For outdoor, engaged activities, I see the wisdom in NOT specifically meditating (yet not zoning out either), particularly with dangers of dogs, people, etc.  However, winter is coming and my exercise equipment consists of a yoga mat and a stationary bike.  I do yoga often, and for what it's worth have a long relationship with meditation and currently do 45 min-1hr daily (I say this not to brag, but I am comfortable sitting with myself for decently long periods of time).  


So obviously yoga (at least how I practice) is fairly meditative, and I enjoy that aspect of it, but I need to incorporate some cardio into my daily routine, and that is where the stationary bike comes in.  I've been attempting several different exercises that I do or have done, such as TNH's ""in out, deep slow, calm easy, present moment wonderful moment"" (my go-to for sitting meditation) and it just doesn't feel right.    


So that brings me to now; what would be some literature, or preferably meditation exercises I could do while on the bike?  I don't want to game, watch shows, or listen to music, as I feel this is a safe enough place that I could embark on another mindful journey.

It's a very very difficult experience to describe. But when I meditate I frequently enter this very same state as my breath becomes very shallow.

626,"What does this ""consciousness"" mean in self-inquiry ?","So I recently got interested in self-inquiry.

The concept of self-inquiry is to ask the questions ""is this I"" to cross out what you are not (the body, the senses, the thoughts..). Finally, arrive to the conclusion that this ""I"" is consciousness itself. 

I listened to Mooji's talk and read Ramana Maharshi's short book ""who am I"".

They all talk about ""consciousness"" or ""Self"" as if this was an essence not bound to the body.

But I can't stop the doubt, consciousness too is just another product of the brain. 

It would've been understandable if it just pointed to the core thinking functionality of the brain.

I suppose this is true or false depending on your definition of meditation. However, I feel as though on a base level its mostly true. I can only speak for myself but when I am having thoughts, good or bad, I find it easy to spend 15+ minutes completely consumed by them.

631,Runaway Trains of Thought,"Disney‚Äôs Inside Out has a couple of metaphors that I just love:

1. the marbles which encapsulate memorable life moments, and 
2. the Train of Thought

A few months before Inside Out was released, I was sitting in meditation during a 2-week retreat.  During my meditation, I became aware that I was thinking about something, and I immediately became curious: when had my thoughts actually ‚Äúinterrupted‚Äù my otherwise inner silence?  So, I focused on the thought, and then I focused on what was I thinking just before that thought, and then the one before that, and so on.  

What occurred for me was a vision of a train, where each car on the train was just like the marbles of Inside Out. (And I hadn‚Äôt even seen the movie yet!  So Spooky cool!).  Anyway, I could peer into the car, and see the context wherein that thought lived.  Focusing on the beginning of that thought / car / marble led me to the preceding thought, within an entirely different car, with its own marble-like life context.  With enough practice, I was able to go backwards in time to the very first train car / marble that originally ‚Äúinterrupted‚Äù my inner silence.

I share this today because I see a lot of posts about folks whose mind is so ‚Äúcluttered‚Äù with thoughts that they report problems meditating.

Perhaps, for some, my technique might be useful.  Just to be curious about the thought, and to try to recall what thoughts led to that thought.  Perhaps this alone may allow some to achieve a perspective between the runaway thought patterns and the one who is meditating.

633,Having a weird day today,"Dunno, just feeling philosophical as of late.
It's my day off today and I've just been getting on with stuff and life feels just hollow. I don't wanna sound negative but it feels like I'm bored of life yet I don't want to die.
I'm 33 and all my efforts just feel like a pathetic attempt to cling on to youth as all the excitement that life once brought just kinda fades away.
I went swimming and I did well, a fair few meters. I reached my goal then even pushed myself. Well done me. Half way through I just thought ""hey I'm swimming"". I stopped looking ahead and just realised I'm in water. I enjoyed the journey instead of the destination so to speak. It was nice. The glistening of the surface, the swishy sounds.
Then I went shopping for food and I really don't like that anymore. I used to but now it's just effort. We spend all our time being bombarded with food ideas yet I get to the supermarket and find I cannot for the life of me think of something new to eat so I just eat the same things over and over. Its like I've spent the last 13 years or so just googling everything, so much I just cannot think for myself anymore.
It's also my day off and I know i'm gonna try my best and fail to do something today that gives me some sort of meaning and forget that tomorrow I'm back to work longing for my next day off so I can do it again.
Christmas is also coming which is cool. I love Christmas so much, I even love how the thought of it coming makes me feel excited but even somehow in that there is sadness. Its sad because life goes so quick now, I know it will be over so quick and It will be winter soon and it will suck. Then I'll long for the spring, then it will be over then summer will come and I'll long for autumn then Christmas again. Repeat repeat repeat until we die.
Our only hope is to fill our days with some sort of goals, to make us feel like we're improving somehow and we're not just aging. That's what gives us meaning. Yet the desire to achieve these things also brings suffering. Yet we must have something, something to ache for because we're afraid of not having something because that would feel like we're just existing and we don't want that. It's like we don't like that voice in our head but God forbid it disappears.
I even asked my colleagues the other day ""what gets 70 years old up in the morning?"". I like seeing places and going for walks and stuff in the great outdoors but sooner or later I can see even that getting boring.
Anyhoo, I don't wanna sound negative that's not my intent. I just wanna express my mood if that resonates with anyone.

637,Can someone explain my experience and what it means? if anything,"I've made sure to capture every detail I deem important, apologies if the read becomes tedious.

&#x200B;

I'm 20 and have been meditating daily for almost 2 months now. I always aim for an hour a day, sometimes I go over sometimes I'm under, but I always do it. My sessions are normally around the 20-25 minute mark and within this time it's not uncommon that I achieve a fairly deep state of calm: feeling my body completely disappear into nothing or feeling areas of my mind completely quiet (shut off?) outside of my object of focus.

Recently, in order to mitigate the urge to masturbate, I opted for a quick session, it was only meant to be a short one. About 30 minutes prior to this I had smoked a small joint but wasn't particularly high. I was sat at my desk chair with my elbows on the arms of the chair and my fingers splayed and touching their opposites in that way people do when they're thinking deeply, only sideways (thumbs facing the ceiling, fingers facing in front)

I haven't really paid too much attention to chakras until recently since what attracted me were the benefits to the mind and body that modern research has proven but I've come across them here.

(After a lot of background) I focused on the energy manifesting at the bottom of my torso and after a while decided to try and move it up through my body, in no rush at all just making sure to let the process take me wherever. As the energy moved up through my body, spending longer periods focusing on where I felt the energy centres were and continuously feeling this energy intensify and grow. I felt different emotions, insights and states of mind the vast majority of which appeared consistent with the chakras' functions that I've seen on pretty much every diagram.

Two important events:

* During and after passing my navel I felt lots of heat flowing between the joining of my fingertips and it felt almost essential that I focus on this heat and the space between my hands. I can only describe the following feeling as the collected energy moving out towards the space between my hands and as it grew to fill the space the heat through my fingers, as well as my hands themselves, became increasingly hot. After a while this feeling spread back through my body and reconstituted itself at my solar plexus.
* When this energy reached my head the stillness of my mind (which for a while had been a 'colour of absence') was filled with dimmish light and a sphere of concentrated light in the middle of my mental space. I felt I should focus on the centre of this sphere which proved difficult not because of the brightness but by nature just felt hard to keep my precise focus centred on. After some amount of time I was able to stay on it and all of a sudden everything that had been otherwise empty and still was filled with this truly immense feeling. I had no thoughts at all, barely even of my breath, my mind was filled with intricate, moving morphing patterns of spirals, tunnels and zigzags. I could also hear a sound, hard to describe but somewhere between the high pitched mechanical beeping of a printer or modem pre-2000s and the twinkling of stars. Ripples, waves and spheres of light I know are a common experience and I've had a few sessions with more intense and complex patterns filling my mental space but this was far beyond anything I thought possible with a beginner's meditation. Also, while this happened the physical space in my brain felt like it was suddenly firing away at 100%, completely filled with electricity.

After the 2nd event came to a close the energy once again I felt move higher still and I came to reach a very wonderful feeling of insight and unity with the universe.

What was supposed to be a quick meditation blew the normal 25mins out of the water, lasting about an hour. Since this has happened (5 days ago) every other session has ended up being 30-45mins. Finally, probably the most significant change: I normally smoke weed twice a day and had been trying but failing to smoke less, since then I haven't felt the need to at all and when I did smoke (a couple tokes to be social) it felt much less satisfying than in the past. During my meditation a recurring thought had been that I need to smoke a lot less.

I‚Äôve tried to practice meditation. For awhile I thought I was. I would really focus on my thoughts, what I was thinking, where my focus was.

I started to get into yoga during that time as well, trying to count my breathe and eventually I got to a point where I felt like all the chattering went away and I could kick the bad thoughts to the curb.

I would take this into my commute to work, contemplating life (typical what is life questions, where is god, how can I become a better person, am I doing this or that right etc) and on my commute home I would get answers 

I would feel this electricity flow thru my body and I felt so free and motivated 

Fast forward a few years and that‚Äôs not the case anymore. I‚Äôm trying to get back to that

I‚Äôve never met ‚Äúreal meditators‚Äù so idek if I was doing it right but I felt like I was

Why and how this is useful?
Let's say you need that emotional/energetic state but you can't do meditation situations like stuck in a traffic, or before a presentation or before a date, or before meeting your loves one's etc.

Try testing it while you are not in meditative state but wanted it at that time,

Just utter ""Active "" your term that you saved during peak state""

670,A metaphor of meditating on Oneness,"I was meditating on the idea of becoming one with the ‚Äúspace‚Äù of the Universe. 

Imagine that your body was hallow for a moment. 

Like a chocolate rabbit. 

Imagine you had two hollow chocolate rabbits filled completely with ocean water on the inside. 

Then put them into the ocean. 

We are like two chocolate rabbits, hollow, made of the same watery material on the inside as the surrounding environment. 

when we touch each other, we at met with flesh and bone (or chocolate in this instance) 

This is the illusion‚Ä¶ the idea of separation. 

The chocolate is this reflective, veil material that we call reality. 

The ocean water inside of the rabbits is a ‚Äúdrop‚Äù of the ocean. 

And the ocean is the source of love, which is what is simultaneously inside and outside of us. 

Break open the rabbits while they are inside of the ocean, and the water from which originally came from the ocean in the first place immediately joins forces with the greater volume and original source. 

The drop is once again reunited with the ocean. 

When you meditate on Oneness and Sameness; your chocolate rabbit shell ‚Äúmagically‚Äù disappears for a moment. I don‚Äôt know how or why yet but this is what I have experienced. Although your rabbit shape is contained, you are reunited and remember and realize your true nature.

If you see the the spiritual eye or blue pearl while meditating, you are ‚Äúpiercing‚Äù the veil that is this chocolate. 

And you feel reunited with the source from which is inside and you realize has been around you the whole time. 

If you‚Äôd like to entertain a quote that is relevant is this: ‚Äúyou are not a drop inside of the ocean; you are the ocean in a drop -rumi‚Äù

I used to meditate daily for the first 3 years of my practice, almost always 20 mins and sometimes more.

My mind feels calm, like I can sit and do nothing in everyday life and have peace, instead of constantly distracting myself to avoid my own thoughts.

However, as I've practiced more I've noticed most of the practices talk of letting go of trying to achieve a certain state of mind, of trying to achieve anything, but simply just 'being'. As I've embraced this, I've noticed my motivation to meditate has lapsed because I'm no longer focussed on the positive goals I want out of it.

This seems to be a paradox: mindfulness promises positive outcomes yet says you should not aim for any outcomes at all. How do you square this?

There, I have two co-workers who love to talk to each other... only their desks are about 20 feet apart from each other, they both lack the ability to use an ""indoor"" voice, and my desk is situated directly between them. Their incessant, impassioned political conversations can go on for literal hours; sometimes from the first sip of coffee until COB, absolutely non-stop for 8+ hours.

I've only recently subscribed to the Waking Up app (and meditation, in general), and I'm trying to learn to be as zen about this situation as I can be. I am okay with practicing mindfulness in noisy environments but I struggle when the noise is actual words being spoken (loudly) that have meanings which my mind translates without my even trying. I wish I could hear their words as pure sounds, but I can't seem to not understand what I'm hearing, if that makes sense. The syllables create words which create sentences that I can't not interpret automatically.

I find it incredibly distracting. I assume the goal is to simply return to my mindfulness whenever I notice it's slipping but I find it nearly impossible in this environment because I constantly get sucked out of my focus.

694,Spontaneous Kundalini Awakening,"Last night, after a month of theta wave meditation, I sat down in half lotus, on my bed. My husband was sitting next to me. I cannot tell you what exactly we were talking about. I had just had my night time cannabis  for RA so I could sleep. 

All of this is quite normal. However, before I knew what was happening I was in a trance like state with my eyes closed, without provocation or intent. I could feel gyrations of my pelvis, core, heart center and shoulders, hands, and neck and head. All gyrating at different speeds and complimentary directions, as if they were on separate energetic planes. 

As they gyrations ensued, where the planes changed, sparks of gold flashed as the orbs of energy moved. Each of the aforementioned body sections were ensconced in. White iridescent like light, except where they connected at the next plane with another orb spinning. That was gold. 

Around me the most vibrant array of colors swirled about me. The bottoms of my feet opened and a blue stream of energy and a green stream of energy went up into each of my arches, up nerve branches in my legs to my sciatic nerves and merged at my pelvis. It coiled and spun until lights more brilliant than aurora borealis burst out of my lower body. The rays began to coil, and serpentine up my spine in a double helix pattern, pulling all the colors with them. As they rose a shape akin to the hood of a cobra flared out, a golden color, reflecting green and blue. Heat rose with the energy, and energetic hood and it felt as though my body were being elongated. 

As the energy moved to my head, the gyrations of my head moved so rapidly and violently that my husband was afraid I would snap my neck and have my head fall off. I heard my own fear rise, and a voice told me if I fought the movement I would hurt myself, possibly break my neck. When the energy made it to my brain, it felt as if my head burst into a million tiny pieces as light forced it‚Äôs way through my skull. The most brilliant white, pink, lavender, opalescent light.  My third eye became brilliant. 

Then the image of a perfectly calm and still me appeared, with a serpent head shading or guarding me some 2-4 feet abound my head. I have no idea how much time passed. It felt like a week, but it wasn‚Äôt even an hour. The serpent relaxed back into my spine, resting it‚Äôs head on top on min. As it descended the scales fell into thousands of iridescent fire opalescent like lotus petals and I sat in the center of the flower. 

Since then I have felt a buzzing about me, and it sounds like water rushing in a conch shell. I am walking about in a state of bliss.

695,Epiphany From Shifting Focus,"I recently watched Andrew Huberman's recent podcast on Meditation and had an epiphany on perspective and ""aiming the spotlight"": 

* If you're naturally hypersensitive to your thoughts/body, you lean towards being Interoceptive. 
* If you're naturally dissociative, you lean towards being Exteroceptive. 

Ask yourself: Where do I naturally lean? Whichever one your biased towards is your Default Mode Network. (They're not fixed and move around but there is usually a bias)

The recommendation is to train the ***opposite*** of your bias. This is more about perspective rather than different meditation techniques. 

For Example: I've been practicing for 5 years and increasing over the last 1.5 years to 2+ hours per day. I've been feeling like I've been getting ""worse"" and my mind has been wandering more (Attributed this to Dark Night of the Soul). This has been happening for the past 6+ months and hasn't been improving, even if I try let go of the notion of ""getting somewhere"".

Even when there's supposed to be an anchor (like breath) I've been naturally focusing the spotlight to my internal feelings/thoughts. It was strange when I opened my eyes and looked at an actual object, I began to feel wildly present, focused, relaxed and in the moment. 

What Solved it: I began to look at the breath (for example) from an exteroceptive perspective, meaning I focused on the breath as an object, something I can't change or control. Same with observing my heart beat. This had a profound improvement on my awareness, happiness, focus and well-being.-- I feel like things finally clicked.

This is very nuanced and I wanted to share with people in case it can help offer a different perspective.

699,How is body scan supposed to feel like?,"The number one thing I hate about guided meditations is body scans. I focus on the parts but I feel nothing. Headspace said to imagine a warm sunbeam passing through your body to feel it. But that makes me even more irritated. It frustrates me that it never mentions how I am supposed to feel. And at the end of the meditation I end up feeling dissatisfied and in a bad mood.

I know body scans are meant to release stress from certain parts of your body and separate the focus from the mind to a body part. I however, see no point or results from doing it.

I switched to Down Dog after, they do body scans too but not as often as headspace.",yjj66r,6,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yjj66r/how_is_body_scan_supposed_to_feel_like/,meditation

704,Does it matter if my focus shifts to different things?,"So I've been practicing different styles of meditation on and off for the past decade, but often times I am confused by information that seems contradictory to me. The simplest explanation that I think most people start off with is, to focus your attention on one thing, like breathing, and when you notice your attention wandering you bring it back to your focus. But what if your center of focus changes during meditation? I find myself focusing on breath for a couple minutes, then I'll focus on physical sensations like wind against my skin for a bit, then I'll focus on a particular sound, or the content of my random thoughts. Either way I try to bring my focus back to something that is happening in the present moment. Is it less efficient to do this, or perhaps more beneficial? I've often heard people refer to vipassana in this way, but then again many people associate vipassana with just breathing/mindfulness meditation.",yjc2y3,7,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yjc2y3/does_it_matter_if_my_focus_shifts_to_different/,meditation

There are a lot of things that are over hyped in this world and before drawing conclusions I would like to ask you: are the benefits of meditation really apparent/measurable or is it over hyped?    

How does meditation differ from any other activity where your mind is focussed on one thing such as surfing or playing the guitar?   

Being quite an introspective person I am afraid meditation will even backfire and make me more introspective. For instance, I can sense my heartbeat by just paying attention to it. Or I am oversensitive and twitch when something touches me unexpectedly.

Thanks a lot!   

By the way: I would by standard already consider myself pretty mindful already. Forcedly unfortunately. I suffer from a state called ""derealization"" since about 15 years. You can Google it but in short, it feels like you watch your life pass like a movie from an outer perspective, almost like during mindful meditation.

714,"Are we the only species not living in harmony with nature, and is meditations purpose to bring us back in harmony?","It seems to me we create so much waste, so I began to wonder if in nature there exists literally one life form that does the same. When it comes to survival, I would think life simply doesn't have that luxury. Yet look at the luxuries we afford ourselves at the expense of everything else.  

The life we live is simply not sustainable. We don't live self sustainable lives like life in nature does. And it creates waste, which I'm now learning is virtually a sin in the bigger picture. I don't think this is what nature intended. 

I believe we stopped living in harmony with nature a long time ago. And in the process, we've become unbalanced. My theory is that this is the reason we've sought out meditation. We know something is wrong/missing in our lives because we're out of balance. We aren't living in harmony. 

I think the true purpose of meditation is to help us realize this by expanding our awareness. And in a weird way, I think nature intended this for us. 

Perhaps we've become so good at adapting to solve our problems, that we forgot how to simply let go anymore. And if all this is the case, then I think it falls on us to do something about it.

715,Phone calls on stage...,"This morning before starting my meditation, a scene popped into my mind...my just-post-toddler daughter pacing around with the landline phone jabbering on with a pretend someone with pretend seriousness in a pretend phone call about a pretend situation in a pretend world, tying up the line so that no one can get through.  The scene ends with my telling her that she needs to hang up for a bit so that daddy can use the phone, and she'll have to call back later.

Suddenly, the scene and cast of characters switch it up...my daughter is replaced with a representation of my conscious liminal character/persona that pretends to be me, going through most of the routine of the day's machine that pretends to be the reality, made up of parts that pretend to be important...all in replacement of my daughter's play conversation in her play world.  I hope that makes sense. 

Meditation is me interrupting the pretend playtime phone call to open up the line to communicate with a more real world of existence.  The phone won't ring if it's tied up with pretend phone calls.  What if the incoming call were important, or I need to inquire about something that really matters? I don't think it is healthy to primarily live a mostly pretend life in a largely pretend world.

Backstory, I‚Äôve been to probably 60+ edm shows sober now. Multiple large raves and festivals. I was a photographer for the live events and I had a blast. Last night though, I put the camera down to just dance among the Halloween party goers. The music was almost the central sound of all the shows I have been to. House. Just. House. 

While on the dancefloor I shared many hugs and found myself dancing at a certain point with no focus in mind.

Partially opening my eyes the light show blurred, my hands smeared and I felt like I was on lsd (I‚Äôve dabbled in the past before I attended raves). I noticed feelings, and I welcomed them. I found myself falling into my feelings of loneliness, desire for intimacy, and many others while in this state, and I say with the feelings. I let them be. This continued for probably 10-20 minutes, but it could have been an hour. I was lost.

745,Why am I struggling?,"I first meditated in 2016. My practice was simple. First thing when I woke up, I would journal, do Yoga Asanas followed by 3 minutes of Anapanna. I kept this up for 31 days.
My focus was effortless, I had almost zero internal conflict(best benefit).
Sadly I didn't keep up the practice and I lost most of the results.
Earlier this year I attended a 10 day silent Vipassana retreat. I experienced similar benefits but they didn't last once the course ended. However I have been able to maintain somewhat of a practice with most of my sessions being 1 hour long.
The problem is, I'm just as distracted as before if not worse. I find my colleagues consistently reminding me to concentrate. This is so frustrating for me. Is insight meditation the problem? Should I meditate less? If you've had a similar problem, please advice.",yihty7,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yihty7/why_am_i_struggling/,meditation

747,"If Steve Jobs was a meditation practitioner, how could he ruin mindfulness for the world? (Posted also on r/mindfulness","(Please note: I made this same post on r/mindfulness, but I realize the input I was looking for was more based in r/meditation. You truly can use a smartphone mindfully, but my inquiry is more focused on when a smartphone distracts you from a breath-based or meta-based meditation practice. So my apologies if anyone is reading this post twice).

As a meditation practitioner for nearly 20 years, I've noticed how terrible smart phones are for mindfulness and meditation practice throughout the day. I switched back to a dumb phone for four years, but due to some international travel and work, I switched back to the smart phone. What a terrible device for my mind. I am again reverting to a dumbphone.

Does anyone have any insights how Steve Jobs was a meditation practitioner, yet he directed his life energies into creating a mini-computer with the internet that would constantly be in our pockets due to also being a phone (that we needed to keep on us)? 

The bigger point to ponder here is how our own career choices can conflict with our inner values.",yi5669,8,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yi5669/if_steve_jobs_was_a_meditation_practitioner_how/,meditation
748,Manifestation comes true??,"Hey guys! I started to meditate about 1 and a half years ago, but while I was keep doing it, I didn't see the results that I wanted, and my manifestations didn't come true. Yeah, I know that meditation has many benefits, it's good for anxiety, for stress, it helps you to be calmer, etc. Don't get me wrong, all of these are great benefits but I believe most people want something more of these things. It can be anything like a car, home, boyfriend, girlfriend, clothes, whatever. But the most basic in my opinion is money. You need money for everything. You need money to pay the bills, you need money to for to eat in a restaurant, you need money for vacations. Money solves 99% of people's problems. I don't know if you can relate, but many times you feel nothing is working. But finally, after a year of struggling, perhaps I found a way to manifest anything nearly overnight!!

751,Meditation not seemingly helpful but for concentration,"I‚Äôve been meditating off and on for years.  I have done several styles for various lengths of time, the mind illuminated(TMI), mindfulness based stress reduction(MBSR), transcendental meditation(and yes I did learn in person).  I have stopped meditating for a few weeks, my work schedule has been crazy.  I feel less connected to my emotions daily, I‚Äôm stressed with work but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs from not meditating, just life.  

What I have noticed is my productivity seems down despite my efforts.  Somehow even though I am focusing all the time I can‚Äôt seem to concentrate on my work, or even during the day.  I‚Äôll zone out while someone is talking to me, even if the content of their speech isn‚Äôt complex just a regular ‚Äúhow my day was.‚Äù  I‚Äôm looking for anecdotally what meditation people find the best for concentration. TM doesn‚Äôt help with concentration in my opinion, but TMI seems too complex and MBSR seems to aggravate my anxiety rather than help it.  I did a day retreat for MBsR and it was the worst, I was so paranoid and stressed out during it despite the 8 week training leading up and having done jon kabat zinns book myself years earlier.  

I should mention I have ADD and have been on medication for a few months after taking a period off.

753,Entered a state of mind where I experienced my weight differently,"At around 15 minutes in into my daily meditation I today experienced a state of mind where I felt myself turned into a very heavy ball. It felt very heavy and quite intense, almost scary. And in the midst of it all I had the thought ""am I experiencing gravity in an extra intense way or some kind of centrifugal force"", and then I quickly went back into feeling the sensations of my body. 

This ball was sometimes quite still but then took on different shapes (all with very round corners) and jumped aggressively and quickly around the earth's surface, just to come back to being still moments later. 

I've had a similar experience like this about 4 months ago, and I would love to experience it more often just to explore more, because it felt scary but important at the same time.

It's quite difficult to explain this so I wonder if someone out there has had a somewhat similar experience, and maybe can share some thoughts?",yi396i,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yi396i/entered_a_state_of_mind_where_i_experienced_my/,meditation

755,After years of meditation I've started getting panic attacks when meditating before bed. Any advice?,"Hey. I've meditated and practised mindfulness for five years now. The last weeks I've been increasing the time I meditate to 30 minutes every morning (20 previously), and then usually a 20 minute meditation during the day or before I go to bed. I'm also in a phase where I make an effort to be mindful/in the now most of the day.

Twice now, when meditating right before bed (when already tired) I've had a feeling of some strong inner darkness overcoming me like dark storm clouds in the sky, with thoughts turning into something nightmarish and frankly turning on *me.* Today I tried countering it with a basic Metta technique, imagining the faces of loved ones and sending them love, but I soon found myself unable to continue as if this darkness was stronger than the love. The faces quickly turned into all scary, nightmarish grimaces, that felt like they had ill intent towards me and were even kind of mocking me.

As I realised this is actually my own mind or Self being afraid of other parts of this mind, made me fearful that I'm actually going insane. The anxiety and panic started arising, and I tried to accept it and just view it from the perspective of consciousness itself. This was very difficult and I found myself very much identifying with the strong emotions and physical reactions to the panic. Afterwards I found myself mistrusting my own senses and being quite shaky and paranoid.

Does anyone have thoughts or experience to share on this? I would be thankful for some perspective on what the causes might be and how to work through this.",yhv4ex,11,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/yhv4ex/after_years_of_meditation_ive_started_getting/,meditation

I'm also looking for a way to get rid of stress and anxiety, workouts isn't one of them, so a friend suggested Meditation. I have an apple watch and an apple fitness+ subscription that does include meditation.

does it REALLY help as people describe it? is there a possibility it wouldn't work for me?

762,Who has the time? (The Mind Illuminated),"Hi. I just started reading ""The Mind Illuminated"" by Culadasa. On page 3 (Kindle version) he talks about the rate of progress moving through the 10 stages and says, ""What you need is a regular daily sitting practice of one to two hours per day in combination with some of the supplemental practices described in the appendices.""

As a ""householder"" who has to balance meditation with work and life, the thought of ""Establishing a Practice"" to that extent is overwhelming. And maybe I'm being unfair here, but his admonition against moving through the stages too quickly and without mastery of the current stage seems to set a tone (for me) that makes me a little uncomfortable because it plays into my desire for perfection rather than just letting things be.

It's probably not the book for me, but it came highly recommended and I'm not a person who likes to throw the baby out with the bathwater so I'd like to know what others think. Might it be helpful to stick with the book or move on to something else? And I'm open to anyone's reading suggestions.
