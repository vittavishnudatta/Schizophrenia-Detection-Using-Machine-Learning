0,New to r/Fitness? CLICK HERE FIRST!,"# Welcome to r/Fitness - Reddit's #1 Health and Fitness community!

r/Fitness is a **self-help** community.  Before asking questions, you are expected to have made a good faith effort to find an answer on your own and show it by explaining where you looked, what you found, and why it wasn't enough.  We ask you to respect that the people answering your questions are volunteering their time, knowledge, and experience.

To help answer your questions, get you started, or help you continue on your fitness journey, we have complied a comprehensive Wiki and FAQ.  [**https://thefitness.wiki/**](https://thefitness.wiki/) is the result of community discussions on best practice, expert opinion, emerging science, and general know-how from those who have made fitness their lifestyle or profession.

# The r/Fitness wiki is moderator funded, and this year we are asking for your help to make it community funded.

Domain registration and hosting costs over $500 per year, but it is important to us to house this resource off-platform.  Why?  To keep it ad-free and prevent any undue sponsorship or marketing influence, to keep it organized, to ensure content and links to outside resources work regardless of app or browser, to enable proper search functionality, and to make sure it's available during site outages.  **If you'd like to contribute**, you can anonymously donate any amount via [an Amazon e-gift card](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-1_US_Email-eGift-Card/dp/B004LLIKVU) to [purplespengler@gmail.com](mailto:purplespengler@gmail.com).  Donations will be closed once the hosting fees are reached, and we thank you for your consideration.

# Resources - Check these for answers before posting a question!

* [The r/Fitness Wiki and FAQ.](https://thefitness.wiki/)  Most questions that people come to r/Fitness with can be answered directly by the Wiki and FAQ or by applying the information found in it.  It will always be the best first place to look for answers.  Moderators or the community can help direct you to the right information if you have trouble finding it.
* [Searching past threads.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/search?q=&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all)  r/Fitness has over a decade of discussion threads that are very likely to have answers to your questions if our Wiki and FAQ does not.  Remember when searching that fitness and exercise are not fast moving topics, and even discussions that are several years old are going to be relevant today.
* [Google.](https://www.google.com/)  Yes, really, or your preferred search engine.  Google excels at being a source of answers for common fitness and exercise questions including exercise alternatives or progressions, meal plan and food options, equipment or product reviews, and so on.
* Yourself.  Many questions we see come down to a matter of personal preference or can be answered by ""it depends.""  You should check in with yourself before asking the community to decide something for you.

What's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Let's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

12,ettiquette while using a mobility aide at the gym?,"UPDATE: hi! thank you for all the nice comments! many of you are helpful! however, please do not call me inspiring or motivating! this contributes to something called ""Inspiration Porn"" and is frowned upon by many disabled people including myself. please look up the term if you are not familiar! i came for advice, not to be touted as an inspiration and it can be a little disheartening. thank you, much love!


obligatory to start: yes, i have spoken to my doctor, and we have discussed which equipment and workouts are safe for me.

the thing is, i could really benefit from using my local gym as a resource, but i use a rollator walker. i don't really know how to be polite and out of the way, as i will need it beside me to help me transfer between equipment. i would leave it up front with staff if i could.

are there specific disabled sections in gyms for people with mobility aides? or is there usually enough room between equipment that i shouldn't worry? as far as i can remember, i have seen treadmills and the like really close together, but this was before COVID. would people consider it rude for my walker to be beside me and ""in the way""? i haven't been in a gym since my diagnosis, so i just don't know how things will work.

i will definitely ask staff questions when i get the courage to try, i just honestly doubt there is much of a 'game plan' at any gym for people in my position. if anyone has experience or can help me know what to expect, please comment!! i have been exercising more, slowly, at home and outdoors, but my worries are keeping me from seeking out the gym.

here's to hoping r/disabilityfitness opens up again soon so i can crosspost there.",yx2r8r,600,165,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/yx2r8r/ettiquette_while_using_a_mobility_aide_at_the_gym/,fitness
13,How to optimize glute-focused workouts with glute activation,"Hi! On leg and glute-centered days, I try to incorporate glute activation exercises before lifting -  unweighted fire hydrants, kick backs, donkey kicks, and side leg circles. I want to be effective in activating the muscle I'm training but I'm really confused about the necessity of glute activation, the extent of it and many reps I should aim for with activation.

Does progressive overload apply to glute activation too? How much activation is necessary?

 I've also seen and heard of people doing around 3 sets of 30 reps with activation (of the glute activation exercises mentioned above) - is this generally acceptable? The purpose of glute activation isn't to exhaust your glutes so how do you know when you've sufficiently activated those muscles to avoid overworking them with a workout and lifting after?",ywl8ic,437,98,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ywl8ic/how_to_optimize_glutefocused_workouts_with_glute/,fitness

23,Physique Phriday,"**Welcome to the Physique Phriday thread**

What's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Let's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

25,Flesh & Metal Program Overview/Review,"I am wrapping up three months of bulking while running my flexible program Flesh & Metal. I caught covid in the last weeks which killed momentum and put me in a little bit of a limbo while I prepared for a cutting period but I still accumulated enough positive results to call the program a success. This write up will cover my results, an overview of the program as I suggest others use it, and a recap of my three month run. Flesh & Metal is appropriate for lifters of any strength level, but requires the user to make decisions pertaining to movements used and accessory work. It is a flexible programming approach which means it can be made to work for a wide variety of training goals and situations but it will not tell you explicitly what to do, so it may not be appropriate for trainees without a basic understanding of what works for them yet. 

**Results**:

Here are some notable PR’s from the three months:

I don’t have before and after photos, [I am already huge]( https://imgur.com/a/83FQOmX), so I do not gain significant muscle from each bulk anymore, I am lucky to be a couple pounds heavier every *year* at this point. Bulk just puts on a few BF% for the most part and a sliver of muscle. You’ll have to trust me that I know what needs to be done to gain muscle and that this program enables that. 
If all of this doesn’t convince you that I probably know what I am doing then you do not need to keep reading if you don’t want to. I won’t be upset. 

**The Program**:

To give the brief elevator pitch, Flesh & Metal (F&M) is a loosely structured training methodology meant to be easily molded. It can be run with any set up, for any length of time, and can focus on whatever you need it to. Its core philosophy is to push for a PR in your current movements every session then move on to new movements when you hit a plateau. The ‘program’ leaves many choices, including what those movements are, what your accessory work is, how many days you want to train, and many other areas up to the user. It is meant to be more of an inspiration/driving force rather than a comprehensive program, and thus might not be appropriate for newer lifters who do not have experience handling these areas for themselves. 

***Progression Scheme:*** 

F&M is centered around two core movements each day. The progression scheme for your core movements is as follows:

-Select your primary movement, and on its initial session push it for a hard set at a weight/rep range of your choice. This set should probably not end in grinding reps, you want a pretty clean set as a starting point. 

-For each subsequent session with this movement, you must achieve a PR in one or more of these ways: increased reps, increased weight, or increase in estimated 1RM (this option is only available if the weight is increased, you can use whatever calculator/formula you want, just be consistent).

-Continue to advance the movement every session until you fail to achieve a PR by the above standards. When this happens, the movement is relegated to the ‘secondary’ position, and your current secondary movement (if you have one), is dropped entirely. 

-Choose a new primary movement for the next session, and lather, rinse, repeat. 

***Session/Weekly Structure:***

Every session will start with your primary movement. Build up to and complete the PR attempt top set. I suggest including either build up, or back off sets for the primary movement. These should be relatively easy, compared to the top set. I suggest going with ~1/2 the reps you will be attempting for the top set, using the top set weight. 2-4 of these sets is probably fine. After this you will move to the secondary movement. Here you just want the 2-4 straight sets, at roughly 80% what your best PR was. This can be 80% weight, or reps, or something in between. The point is to have hard but doable sets, the goal here being to ‘lock in’ what you developed when pushing the movement for PRs. After these core movements you will perform your chosen accessory work.

How many days a week you train is up to you, but I recommend having a separate set of primary/secondary movements for every 2 days you train. For example, a 4 day structure would look [something like this]( https://imgur.com/a/Cb46iSY)

I think that in most cases 4 or 6 sessions a week is the right choice for this program. But odd numbers are doable, just keep moving down the ABABAB or ABCABCABC pattern regardless of the day of the week. You can also incorporate days that are not part of the program. For example you could run 2 or 4 F&M days a week and then several days of something else. 

When choosing movements choose variations you are not super familiar with, or have not focused on in a long time. One of the main purposes for this methodology is to take advantage of rapid potential for improvement when learning, or refreshing, a movement, and the fact that it provides a wide variety of stimuli. Rotating a small pool of movements or movements you frequently work is not in line with this. Simple variants, like using a new bar, or a different grip, or a different Range of Motion, are all good ways to achieve this without going to completely new movements. 

I think that keeping a pairing of upper body primary with lower body secondary, and vice versa, is the best practice here, but you are free to go against that if you wish to adhere to a more rigid split. Similarly, keeping each session's movements in a similar pattern, such as the example week with Overhead Press paired with a Hinge, and a Horizontal Press paired with a Squat, is a good idea too. This helps ensure you are not performing similar movement patterns on back to back days. 

***Rationale:***

F&M is set up as it is for several reasons:

-Versatility: this is a program that has zero equipment requirements/limitations, can be made to fit a training block of any length, and can fulfill any general training needs. It will not prepare you for specific goals as well as a more specialized program but can be molded to fit anyone’s ‘off season’. 

-Sustainability: By the very nature of this program sustained plateaus will not happen. You can run this program indefinitely and you will never run into a wall. Granted, this opens up the possibility to sandbag and spin your wheels, but that is a possibility in most any program, even if this one won’t rub your face in it. 

-Injury Prevention: I pretty firmly believe that injury is primarily the result of overuse in the form of long-term load mismanagement. While a specific incident might push an area over the edge into injury, there is almost always a building issue in that area that precipitates that incident. By regularly cycling movements it is much more difficult to overwork specific areas to the point of injury, as they are not being pounded by the same stimuli day in and day out. 

Novelty: By incorporating so many movement patterns into your training you are likely to be choosing some that work your body in ways it has not worked before, or at least in ways that it does not get worked frequently. This can help develop undertrained areas you were not even aware you had. 

***General Suggestions:***

-This program is appropriate for either a bulk or a cut, but choose your degree of accessory volume and/or the intensity of your build up/back off and secondary sets appropriately. When cutting these all should be lower, when bulking higher. 

-Do not go as hard as possible every session on the top set of your primary movement. You will reach the point of grinding soon enough, don’t speed that process. Doing so will not only force you to switch movements more rapidly, but also lose some of the inherent periodization of the program which could interfere with fatigue management. Your goal should be to chip your previous PR, not blow it out of the water. 

-If you do feel that fatigue is eclipsing your recovery, consider choosing movements that are more technically or mechanically challenging for a while, as they will require lower absolute loads and will likely cause less overall fatigue. 

-Consider tracking at least your primary movements in a notebook or spreadsheet. You will be setting a lot of PRs while running this program, and you might want to be able to reference them later. 

***Inspirations:***

This program has multiple inspirations, and unlike someone claiming that their programming is totally novel (it’s not) I will gladly talk about them. 

-Average To Savage 2.0, Greg Nuckols: I think that A2S2 is one of the best general-purpose programs out there. After running it in 2020 the combination of a lower and an upper body compound a day, and the incorporation of multiple variants as primary movements really stuck with me. Its approach of buildup/back off sets with a singular top set is not unique, but this was the program that exposed me to it. 

-The Wisconsin Method, Eric Bugenhagen: This is relatively obscure, and frankly the information is so scattered and that I cannot really point to anything or guarantee that I am properly attributing the ideas, but the concepts were presented to me with this name and attributed to the Bugez. In short, it’s the same basic principle, but with even less structure and more Bugez intensanity. My main takeaway was the idea of pushing to PR every time and moving onto a new movement when you failed to do so was from these various posts/videos. 

-Many Other People: It would take a while to list them all, and I would probably miss some, but there are a lot of people who helped put the idea of expanding your scope for PRs, training with high variation, and putting your focus on training hard and constantly rather than getting lost in specifics and living in a world of %s and Squat, Bench, Dead. Everything that I write to you is inspired in part or in full by those around me (usually in a metaphorical sense, as most of it is online interaction). I just aim to collect this wisdom, internalize it, then release it into the wild with my own spin so that it might spread farther and continue the cycle. 

**Recap of my Run:**

I ran F&M for just shy of three months, with covid messing up the planned weeks 12 and 13. My weekly structure was as follows:

-Monday: F&M, Overhead Press/Hip Hinge Core Movements

-Tuesday: F&M, Horizontal Press/Squat Core Movements 

-Wednesday: Upper Body Hypertrophy 

-Thursday: F&M, Overhead Press/Hip Hinge Core Movements

-Friday: F&M, Horizontal Press/Squat Core Movements 

-Saturday: Lower Body Hypertrophy 

-Sunday: Arm Hypertrophy 

The core movements I worked through were: 

-Overhead Press: Clean and Jerk, Behind the Neck Strict Press

-Hip Hinge: Zercher Deadlift, Single Leg Deadlift (Frame)

-Horizontal Press: Larsen Press, Slingshot Bench

-Squat: Marrs Bar Box Squat 

[Here is the whole tracking spreadsheet of weights used/reps achieved]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n64f9XNKrNDfAXWTqGisgpTBsHq0_VY0ojnt2Zb_34k/edit?usp=sharing)

Accessory Movements were fairly minimal on F&M days. Training every day requires acceptance that some days won’t have a ton of work. I went in *intending* to follow a similar Upper, Lower, Arms pattern with one day off accessory work but ended up just hitting each day however I wanted. 

As I am wont to do, I went off and maxed weird stuff instead of accessories on many days, but I completed at least the primary movement on nearly every scheduled day. My adherence to the secondary movement was hit or miss. I do believe it is a good idea, so this is an area of do as I say not as I do. I doubt many of you are as inclined to explore the depths of esoteric and Avant Garde lifts so you will probably not have to worry about being distracted by a Yoke Arthur Clean. 

The hypertrophy days were performed at a local commercial gym. I like the pattern of including three days at the gym dedicated to hypertrophy work in my bulks. It keeps me from getting too far off track doing weird shit, as the ultimate goal of every bulk is to milk whatever extra muscle gain I can. A guarantee of three days a week where I focus on getting the volume in boring lifts needed to do that goes a long way towards meeting that goal.
 I also like the large variety of machines available at the gym. I am a firm believer in the value of machines to accumulate additional, more focused, volume for muscle groups you want to grow. Fixed movement patterns let you hit the muscles you want despite fatigue, and let you circumvent the smaller muscle groups/joints/connective tissues that can be beaten up with free weight work. People who completely eschew machine work in their training because they believe it’s inferior are silly. Machines have value for every kind of lifting related goal. 

Upper Body Days are general alternating movements for back and chest, usually following a pattern of heavier/more compound to lighter/more isolative, shoulder finishers included at the end when I remember. As example, an upper body day might look like Smith Machine Press, Heavy Single Arm Chest Supported Row, Converging Chest Press Machine, Lat Pulldown, Chest Fly, Cable Lateral Raises. Most of these end up in the 10-20 rep range. Not because I believe that range is special, it’s just what feels best for me. 3-4 sets per movement. 

Lower Body Days follow a pretty defined pattern for me these days. Leg Curls, building from warmup to a heavy top set. Leg Press or Hack Squat, which is just a single heavy top set with intensity modifier (drop set, rest pause set, cluster set, etc. Basically, anything that takes the set past traditional failure). Then I get sets of cable crunches, these are super useful because depending on the day I might have a serious lower back pump from the previous work, cable crunches do a good job of cooling that area down. Then I work obligatory calf work and finish up with a quad focused isolation like leg extensions or Bulgarian split squats. 

Arm Days are just 3 sets of Bi/Tri movements alternated. I incorporate a dedicated arm day in my bulks because arms (at least mine) need the dedicated work and because it’s a very low fatigue day, which is valuable when I am trying to maintain 7 workouts a week. I don’t have many specifics to cover here, I am not someone to be asking about growing arms. 

I walk 3 miles twice a day with my dog as general LISS cardio, I think that getting extra walking in is pure upside regardless of how you are training/what your goals are. Helps with recovery by getting blood moving and helps maintain an effortless cardiovascular base. I also row a 5k a couple times a week when bulking, in contrast to almost every night when cutting. It fulfills the need for slightly more intense cardio. 

I eat over 6000 calories a day to support all of this activity at my size (6’5’’ 265lbs +/-10). As I figure someone will ask if I don’t mention this. All of which is solid food. 

**Conclusion:**

I am glad that this loose form program panned out. I can now add it to my tiny but growing library of programming options that I have been building up. While I probably don’t personally need to write out and structure my programming ideas to make them work for me, doing it helps me better understand *why* I do the things I do, and thus more easily communicate the ideas to others. If what I have presented here has sparked your interest I have a largeish library of write ups including [long]( https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1dZdILLezOnR9UWXK6w8tW29SgFJNzyyw) and [longer]( https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1koNt2c_o4TN74QyGgm7bEKU9tRiQUuCb) writings.
