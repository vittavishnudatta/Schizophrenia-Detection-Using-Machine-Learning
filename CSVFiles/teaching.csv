1,Entitled parents,"Background:

This is my first year as athletics director. The previous AD left me with nothing. I have been trying to figure out as much as I can. This is my 10 year teaching history. 

I marked this as humor because all you can do is smile and shake your head….

Anyways, during our first high school volleyball game a parent/former school board member comes up to me and says “why isn’t my daughters state banner up in the gym?” I replied which daughter? And when?  I was completely caught off guard not really sure of what she was asking. The parent continues with “when I come into this gym I want to see my daughters name. Why isn’t her banner up there. She should have a banner. I’ll pay for it if that’s is the case. How much does it cost?” She then looks at the parents behind me, as she confronted me as I was sitting in the bleachers. “If you won a banner wouldn’t you want to be able to see it?” 
 I replied “umm I have no idea. This is my first year. I didn’t know we were missing banners”. She comes back with “it’s your job tho to know.” Then luckily a bystander speaks up and asks the parent when her daughter graduated she said “2014.” The bystander points up and says she is on the 2013 banner because it was the 2013 season. The parent says “well you should have just told me to shut up” I shook my head got up from the bleachers and walked to the other side of the gym.",z2whqh,56,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/z2whqh/entitled_parents/,teaching
2,What made your favorite teacher your favorite teacher,"Im gonna start from the beginning cause it’w kind of a long story.
And btw at this point I see my fav teacher as my own father
When I was in elementary school (10yo) I met my online best friend on facebook, at a group game, we somehow became friends and since then we’ve been face timing each other (Im gonna call my internet bsf N, she is 1 year older than me and girl) 
2 years ago we met for the first time and then with time, it wasn’t awkward at all and I had the best time of mt life and after a few weeks I became close friends with her brother who’s studying abroad, but we became friends through discord and I met up with him 2 months ago.
Now Im a 18 yo male soon to become 19 in 2023, I met my favorite teacher, and lemme tell you that this is the first time in my life I consider someone my favorite teacher, as he have such a huge impact on my life and I love him with everything, first lesson this year I told him that I sucked at his subject even tho its a primary subject, mostly cause last year’s teacher wasnt really into teaching so I was left with gaps, that day he told me that I dont have to worry and everything is gonna be okay and was smiling the whole session. I went back home and wanted to know who he is and I “stalked him” and to my surprise and I found out that he actually was my online bsfs cousin, I was so surprised and they themselves wouldnt have guessed it lol, cause my online bsfs had no idea that he was a teacher and not only that, they havent met up with him for more than 6 years, they told me to tell him that they miss him so much and Ive done that lol, he was surprised and happy at the same time (I see him once a week in class and we study 4 hours in that day) he would always check up on me in class and ask if I was doing great or no/ understood the lesson, he wasnt doing that to me only but to most of the class which I considered something special, a few weeks later he have told me that he is so proud of me because I made a huge progress in his subject, not only that but he would usually smile to me whenever he sees me in the street, call me funny names and pat me sometimes hehe, I then made a group for an additional session outside of school which is something common in here for primary subjects, and since Im a baccalaureate student/ A level in USA I needed the lessons, and my fav teacher would usually tell me that Im gonna succeed this year and he always tells me that he is waiting for me to make it.
And so there’s this one time when me and the my group went to his home to study and I asked a question for fun (something we do to bring up convos for fun) I said “would it make a difference if i was absent” He then laughed and said “Im waiting for yall to be absen so that I want have to teach” he said it in a jokingly way, and everyone laughed, he then looked at me and told me infront of them that he loves me so much and he got auch a huge respect for me to the point that he wished that I wouldve been his son, and im a special student for him, I felt so happy and I told him that I love him so much, one of the students in there interrupted and my teacher told het to shut up (if he says something offensive its just for fun and everyone knows him for that and for his humor) he then told her “dont you see that my heart is gonna pop out for him ? Lemme tell him how much I love him” and carried on doing that for a few more seconds and then we focused again on the paper that we had as work.
Since that day I felt sooooooo special and he always had a special place for me cause ge was so supportive and caring towards me. But this time, he blew me, I couldnt think of something better in my life (for the record I really needed his words cause Im dealing with some problems in life, possibly depression is starting to kick in again)
Moving forward, during a lesson in his home (every 4 lessons we pay 50 dollars)
Something happened, that was the day where everyone is gonna pay him (its legal) and one of the students in there said “i aint tonna pay unless u bring us an easy test” (he was joking) so I stood up, got the money out of my pocket and slammed em on the table

I then felt so bad for doing such am action as it is so disrespectful, and tried to cover it up by saying “no need for his money, gotchu sir”
He wasnt mad and he was laughing cause he knew that everyone was joking and that nobody would ever disrespect him from his students.
After the lesson was over I waited for everyone to leave and told him that I was so sorry for doing what Ive dome for the money, he comforted me and told me that he knew that I was joking and would never do anything bad towards him
Later that day one of my friends dmed me and told that my teacher was angry when I did it (which is something that I didnt see)
I then felt so bad and started overthinking it
4pm I went back to him home (he was teaching another group) I asked for a word with him and he agreed 
He asked why did I come and I told him the reason he smiled and told me that there is nothing to worry about, I then explained why I needed to come, he then hugged me wnd high fived me wnd I went back home.
2 weeks later which is yesterday I got a bad mark in a subject and I told him about it in class, (the subjects are electricity and mechanical, my fav teacher is the mechanical teacher)
He have comforted me and told me to try and forget it, after all its just a test and I dont have to worry about it, and he told me thats he is proud if me no matter what happens
I literally started tearing up cause I wished that my own father would be as compassionate as my fac teacher is.
I forgot to mention that I took a picture with him, I left happy after that lol",z2oced,54,20,https://i.redd.it/p25bf2g3oq1a1.jpg,teaching

8,3 things that have helped me engage with my students,"1.	Using movement in the classroom: Instead of just sitting and listening to a lesson, I’ve been shaking things up and having students move throughout the classroom. I recently incorporated a classroom scavenger hunt into a lesson. 

2.	Utilizing feedback: This year I have been using [Tailor-ED](https://www.tailor-ed.com/teachers) resource library and exit tickets. Having exit tickets automated has saved me so much time and energy. I use the resource library for games and worksheets that are generated based on student feedback. 

3.	Adding structured talks into lessons: Setting aside time for students to think for themselves and discuss context with classmates has been extremely effective for overall engagement.

9,Educational gift box exchange idea,"As a geography lead with too much time on my hands and just wanting to raise the profile of geography in extracurricular fun ways.. I was thinking it would be cool to do a sort of secret santa but with an educational/geographical twist.

I was thinking the children could be given the question: ""What represents us?"" And then come up with ideas to ""fill a box"" with our stories as people from X place in the world. I'd like to keep it open as with the right children they can probably come up with some really cool ideas but quickly off the top of my head some ideas I thought of were:


*artwork of local area
*Photos
*Writing about their lives/ local area
*Writing or pictures that represent their town, local area, country.
*Food (sweets?)
*Landmarks - how could they include those?
*Small things that maybe more unique to individuals in the class

I think it'd be really interesting for the children (and myself) to receive a box filled with a snapshot of someone elses life and living environment from across the world. If there's anyone interested, please let me know in the comments below or via DM.

A couple of ""rules"":
*Postal address must be for a school (ideally primary -- ages 5-11)
*Must be committed to posting them by end of March 2023
*Box should be shoebox sized and with the purpose of representing the childrens local, regional or national environment.
*Contents to be ideally child led and with some effort put into it

I think as a school, I can probably post 4-6 of these boxes. So I'm happy to have up to 6 different people. I know this sub is primarily American so that's cool as I'm sure states vary massively in some cases... If there's anyone outside of America that'd be amazing too.

I am from the UK. (I would also be open to others from the UK too as a more local comparison and the differences between our boxes would have some great talking points.) 

Children over 11 (high school teachers) I would still consider but I'm not sure your kids would appreciate getting primary school aged stuff sent back... Or maybe they'd find it really cute lol

My main thing is getting people who are committed and interested. I don't want to start the project and have all my kids work hard to receive nothing back (although that's a life lesson I guess...)

15,I think my admin is pushing me out,"Long-time lurker, first-time poster here. I’m not as much afraid of what’s going on as I am simply angry about it, so feel free to comment as you would like, whether you have advice or support for me.

I’m a 4th year teacher. My admin is putting pressure on me to change how I operate in my classroom and has yet to explain to me what they actually want. This is a single person that has not evaluated me until this, my fourth year (an AP has evaluated me for the three years prior and nothing has stood out to me as problematic or indicative of any big issue I need to sort out before this year).

First year: came in once to tell me that a couple students have made comments to him about me (I am a male teacher and believe that those comments involve a couple pairs of sweat pants I wore during “Dress like a PE teacher” month). He expressed support (even told me to hide behind the piano as a possible solution, which I found to be an odd suggestion). I was mortified about the students’ comments, yet also relieved that he wanted to back me.

Second year: This was the year we started online. He comes in with another admin to talk about my low enrollment in choir… during COVID… He comes in one more time to watch 10 minutes of a class and leaves without making any comments.

Third year: Admin talks with me once after each concert about a couple improvements. Mentions my piano abilities (they are not the best but also not in my contract to teach choir) and how he wants live music at the concert. I did secure an accompanist for the next concert.

Fourth year: I miss a meeting and he sends a long email about responsibilities and professionalism. I later find out that he is my evaluating principal for the year. His comments so far have been mean, unforgiving, and do not leave room for collaboration or growth, only results and compliance. 

TL;DR:
An admin is getting pushy and seemingly upset that my classroom is not run a certain way, yet won’t tell me exactly what they want.",z0jfop,85,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/z0jfop/i_think_my_admin_is_pushing_me_out/,teaching
16,Does it get easier?,"I(24F) am currently in my second year as a teacher and I'm really struggling with conflicts. Specifically conflicts with parents.

Despite knowing that I'm just starting out and that it's normal to make mistakes, I just cannot simply let it go. 

I was wondering if dealing with angry parents gets easier over time or that education just might not be the right fit for me? Because I can already feel my mental health starting to degrade due to all the anxiety.

18,How to Set an English Question Paper - 6 Highly Useful Tips,,z10yqn,2,2,https://www.datatobiz.com/blog/how-to-set-an-english-question-paper/,teaching
19,An idea I had except I no longer teach.,"Hello! I flailed this as a vent since I’m not sure what else it really is. I had this idea but never had enough time to make the sheets and build the infrastructure for it to be presented to a class. I figured I’d leave it here in case anyone wants to use or modify the idea. (Sorry in advance to grammar and format, I’m on a mobile device) 

It’s probably not the most original idea, but in my time in school and teaching I hadn’t seen anything on teacher share websites or Reddit. So if you’ve heard of it or thought of it I promise I’m not stealing. Just a girl who loves a good YouTube video.

I was a relatively young teacher and I changed career paths before I got too caught in the system. It’s not easy. 

This idea can be for most classes but I taught English. It may also be fair to say this should be for closer to high school students but could be modified for younger (?). It’s a Multimedia Essay in the style of a YouTube video essay/podcast.

The concept was to show students YouTube clips from “PopCultureDetectives”, “Defunctland”, and so on obviously they would have to be clean for the classroom or warned for content, you know the drill. 

Then students would do something similar, find a topic no matter how niche that relates to them. Video games, tv, movies, sports, whatever. Then they would find a question within that topic. (This section was always broad and I never found a good way for students to narrow it down since I never put it into practice) you could have them do quick 5 minute PowerPoints like that TikTok trend then have them expand on the ideas. Or have them tap into conversations they share with friends. 

They would research and write a script as if they were going to compose a YouTube video or podcast for it. Obviously you would break down the key points of a video essay such as catchy introductions, leaving some mysterious for the final review and learning to go into detail on topics that the “viewer” of their channel may not know. (Ex: this is so and so and they worked for blah from 2000-2006 the reason this matters…) 

You would want to encourage humor as well as confidence that often gets lost in writing. Then you can decided how far to go. They could make an actual YouTube video with sourced photos, they could record a podcast, they could do it live in front of the class, or just submit the script and photos. Whatever you decide, though it would be cool to see the video essays come to life. 

Anyway, I know it’s not much but I think the tool that is YouTube is very valuable and very overused by students why not introduce them to an educational side and show them how YouTubers make these videos.",z0po0o,10,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/z0po0o/an_idea_i_had_except_i_no_longer_teach/,teaching
20,Looking for authentic yearbook texts/pages for an English lesson,"I teach English in Germany and am planning a unit on American yearbooks.

If any of you could send me a few excerpts or pages from an actual yearbook (anonymized of course!) I'd be incredibly grateful. I think this would really improve the lesson(s) a lot.

If possible, pages about clubs/sports; student superlatives; or just general highlights of the year (or all of the aforementioned) would fit perfectly!

22,Teaching ethics...or not.,"I teach in a conservative area and am in a constant state of worry that what I am teaching is too ""political.""   


The Army National Guard was invited to our school and students were sent to check out the equipment and listen to recruiter-type pitches. When we got back to the classroom, I felt compelled to fill in many of the blanks recruiters left out. For instance: the potential for 18-month deployments to conflict areas where one could be put in harms way and required to take another life, differences between rights as a civilian and life under the Universal Code of Military Justice, payscale differences between officers and enlisted, and, naturally, what constitutes a ""just"" war/conflict.   


I also inform them of, and encourage them to think about, which subset of the population (in terms of socioeconomic status), recruiters spend the majority of their time focusing on, and who ultimately pays the greatest toll in conflicts our nation becomes involved in. I also delve into Dwight D. Eisenhower's presidential farewell address and his warnings about the military-industrial complex.  
Unfortunately, my class is quiet and it is difficult to get them to discuss a subject (any subject) which leaves me feeling like I am just preaching rather than trying to hold an informed discussion that values and considers alternative viewpoints. 

Is it wrong to point out issues within our country that are blatantly unethical? Is being ethical, valuing life(human or other), and pointing out where greed creates conflict and intense suffering a ""political"" thing?  Needless to say, given the patriotism (if not nationalism) found in many rural, conservative areas, I fear for my job. But I want students to make informed choices.",yze9qv,170,99,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/yze9qv/teaching_ethicsor_not/,teaching

To give you context, I'm alone in a clas of 26 students, 18 boys and 8 girls. Out of the 18 boys ONLY 6 OF THEM are really well behaved and I've never had to address their behavior or send them to the dean. On top of that, they've also added 2 students with specific IEPs. (I'm a general Ed English teacher). I've continuously called home, sent kids to the dean, gave out 0's. Nothing seems to be working at all. These kids just don't care about anything. There are two kids in particular who I know if they weren't around the classroom dynamic wouldn't be the way it is because when these 2 kids are absent the class environment is different and so respectful. I've started documenting everything that happens but it's really been eating at me because I can't ever find the right management tools to handle this class. I really think it's because I'm a 26 year old female teacher and they simply just do not respect me but it's really becoming difficult when all of my other students want to learn and it's affecting their ability. I can't have time to help those students cause I'm busy addressing behaviors. To top it all off, one of my students (who has an IEP) has extremely low comprehension skills and will physically sit there and avoid work unless I go up to him and sit with him and guide him through the whole thing. I've brought this up to admin many times that he needs a support class in place but they respond with ""it just doesn't fit in his schedule"". He's in 11th grade and all of my students are taking the regents in January. This kid is on academic probation and failing every single class, my boss basically told me I shouldn't fail him for the first quarter and to ""help him as much as I can"" as if I haven't been helping enough. So, idk what to do with that anymore. As for the ring leader, he also has very insufficient writing skills, he's distracting and disruptive to other students, yet he's on one of the schools sports teams and I'm wondering if he continues if I can bring up to the deans if they can somehow hold that over his head in order to behave.

29,Is it safe to say…,"… that a student who just refuses to apply herself, behave respectfully, and routinely turns in stuff a month late may *not* actually have ADHD, regardless of what her overinvolved and condescending stepmom tells me?

How likely is it that this student *does* have it, and how likely is it that stepmom is just making excuses?

EDIT (for context): I should’ve mentioned this, but this kid *does* have an IEP. Her modifications do ask for “extended time” (which needs to be specified), but I dunno, expecting to be able to submit work over a month after it was assigned?

Does anyone else find the workshop model or the units of study to be incredibly boring? The topics of the units are interesting and the final projects have the potential to be really cool but the day-to-day just seems so monotonous. 

Part of the issue is that about 90% of my students are below grade level, so we really have a hard time teaching the units as they're written. We have to go back to a lot of elementary level content because there's such a huge gap between what the units expect vs. what the kids are capable of doing without a ton of scaffolding. 

Another part of it is the apathy on the kids' part. It doesn't seem to matter how good my relationships with them are, how enthusiastic I am, how much choice I give them every step of the way, or what type of project we're doing. The kids are so disengaged that even asking them to read a paragraph of something is like pulling teeth. Is there something I'm missing?

57,How to quiet a class when you've already done everything you can?," 

Hi everyone!

I have a little problem... I'm currently studying to become a (Dutch) teacher. I'm in my last year now. I'm also still learning English, so I want to apologize in advance for all the spelling mistakes. :)

For my internship, I have to teach 12 to 13 year olds. Most of the students are really nice and kind when you talk to them individually, but during the lessons they keep talking to each other...

I've tried so many things to quiet them (yelling, asking them to be quiet in a friendly way, writing their names on the whiteboard, setting them apart, standing in front of the class without saying a word, calling them by their names, ...). Nothing seems to help. Whenever I write a note for their parents, they laugh at me, they don't care about it... I have absolutely no idea what else I could do... I've already tried all the 'typical' tips and tricks.

I asked the teacher of this class what else I could do, but she says I have to find my own way... Most of the time, she doesn't give me tips, because she wants me to learn from my mistakes (which is a good method, but on the other hand, it leads to having bad grades during my internship).

I know I should indeed find my own method to quiet a class, but during all of my internships I've never had such a class. All the other classes that I've had always listened to me whenever I asked to be quiet. I'm already doing all the things I can and all the things I've learned during my course...

Some of the students say rude things to me and when I ask them to stop, they deny it and say that they haven't said anything rude and that I'm imagining these things (which isn't true!).

A lot of my students are migrants, so they often start talking in their own languages (that I don't understand). When I ask them to speak Dutch (which is a rule at this school), they tell me I'm crazy, racist and that I'm imagining these things... (This is absolutely NOT true! I'm definitely not a racist. I even try to involve their cultures into my lessons and I try to show interest. My mother was a migrant too, so I'm definitely not a racist, I love to learn about different cultures).  
Today we were doing a lesson about formal and informal language, so I asked the migrant students if they have this too in their language and if they could give some examples. One of them said a word in Arabic, and all the other Arabic students started laughing (so it was probably something inappropriate). Then another Arabic student said: ""It's none of your bussiness"". I was just trying to show interest and making them understand the lesson better...

They are constantly testing my limits and being rude and I don't know what else I could do... The main problem is the talking. I can't even finish my sentences when I'm explaining something...

I've also tried different (active) teaching methods (games, Kahoot, ...) but that doesn't work either...

62,Admin are making this the most miserable year of teaching... I'm leaving,"First time rant here. 5th year teaching. I was really hopeful at the beginning of this year. I was teaching *only* one new course, and was ready to use material for my other new courses so this year wouldn't be as much more.

However, the new admin of the school forced me to adopt the curriculum of another teacher teaching the same subject. They have 'seniority'. I don't just have to adopt their curriculum, we have to have the same tests, same quizzes, same schedule, same pace, same homework. It's not fun, and the amount of work is roughly twice the amount that I had in a previous year I taught this math subject.

I'm also teaching a new AP class and have 6 classes (so 3 preps, but only one prep period).

I found out quickly in the year that my student's math skills were abysmal. I mainly have 10th and 11th graders, but their math skills are so bad that at least 50% of them are getting almost 100% of questions wrong just from basic arithmetic errors and distribution, exponents, solving for x, etc. I have added remedial homeworks and days to address this, but the issue monumentally large.

I realized eventually that this is a systemic issue with my school. Passing kids through, whether they deserve it or not.

I was pulled into a meeting to discuss the number of failing students in my class, which was quite high. There were all sorts of student complaints where kids were making up things, like 'UncleZiggy doesn't teach us anything!' and 'he won't answer any of my questions!'. These get funneled to counselors, who knowing nothing of the truth, present a calamitous case to administration, who are forced to address it, but give no solution to the underlying problems that I present them. All the suggestions are about basic teaching practices that I already implement, but they refuse to make larger changes, and they give no encouragement.

I have been pulling 60-70 hour weeks almost this whole semester. I've been staying around 2 hours after school every day to give students opportunities for tutoring and for grading. I have worked more than I ever have, and no one gives any appreciation for it, the results are the worst I have ever had, and it feels terrible, day in and day out in those math classes. The pace keeps me from doing what I know the students need, and admin gets really stringent on not being on the same schedule and matching those quizzes and tests exactly. I skipped one quiz to just focus on remedial learning from middle school math, and admin were up in arms about that.

It's just too much. Kids complaining and acting out, parents complaining why their student is failing, counselors relaying tons of false information, admin not knowing their left from right, working way too much because of a ridiculous curriculum that favors quantity over quality without any flexibility, and an overwhelming number of tests and quizzes all the time.

Oh and I forgot that I have 50 more students than I did last year. (100 -> 150).

I'm literally looking for new jobs in the middle of the year.

I have a class at the moment who are very difficult, they haven’t got any faith in their own ability and they just see my subject as ‘hard’ so won’t even try without me absolutely holding their hand the whole way. They’re in a really fixed mindset and it feels like no matter what amount of scaffolding or how basic I make the work, they won’t even give it a go. My usual strategies aren’t working and my relationship with the class is quite poor as a result. Some of them quite openly see me as an adult who is out to get them and have come to associate my lessons with failure/stress. 

I’m looking for some recommended reading around this if anyone has any suggestions! I teach maths if that helps.

68,Observation did not go well,"I teach 6th grade ELA at a public school in NM. This is my 10th year teaching. I have been at my current district since last school year. We have a new principal this year and my formal observation last week did not go very well. I was under the impression that these formal observations should not be a show. They want an accurate picture of what your classroom is like on a daily basis. So, I didn't plan anything special. It was just another day in the classroom. We were doing a first read of a non-fiction text about Dr. Jane Goodall's work with chimpanzees. The feedback I got was that the kids were not engaged. My state has a 4 point observation scale, so I got a few 2's. I didn't really care too much about this. It's fine. The teacher next door to me, a 6th grade science teacher, put on a show. She totally pulled a new topic and had a demonstration and lab for the students. She got all 4's on her observation with feedback like ""your kids were excited and participating in the lesson!"" Well, no shit. It's nothing against this teacher, she and I are cool. She's a nice person and I consider her a work friend. But I am so frustrated. It wasn't even the principal who did her observation. Science and social studies departments have the assistant principal as their observer. He is a chill guy that is the ""good cop"" when kids get in trouble. The principal is tougher. He is the ""bad cop"". I am crushed. In am environment where it seems like admin and school districts are firing teachers over nothing, I am terrified that I am not going to get a contract renewal for next year. In order to be considered tenured, you have to have completed 3 years with the district. If anyone has any advice for how to move forward in this situation, I am all ears.

69,Child-Centered V.S. Knowledge-Centered?,"
In my time of researching the discipline of pedagogy and cognitive science. I have discovered that there is approximately two fundamentally doctrines that instructors follow on how to teach. Without going into a lot of details the two doctrines are Child-Centered Learning and Knowledge-Centered Learning. Child-Centered learning is the belief in tapping into each child’s curiosity and nature to provide knowledge towards a subject. I.E. “Nature over Nurture” or “Don’t be a sage on the stage. Be a guide on the side.” While Knowledge-Centered learning is the belief in direct instruction to the class as whole with content focused subject lessons instead of the separation of each subject and skill focused lesson you found in Child-Centered learning. I.E. “Nurture over Nature” or “Be a sage on the stage. Don’t be a guide on the side.” 
1.My question to this community is which do you prefer to use?
2. Why do you like that doctrine more?
3. Did you even know that there was two fundamental doctrines to begin with?

Note: Like most disciplines this subject is very complex and not entirely black and white. Both doctrines are very complex my brief summary at the beginning doesn’t explain the whole part of both. I simply would like to know where you stand in your beliefs when comparing and contrasting these two doctrines and why.

71,How to stop relying on lecturing-then-test as my sole teaching method?,"Hi. I am a current teacher in public science high school in my country. I got in this job since I graduated with a degree in biology and a scholarship that allows me to get stipends monthly while in college with a contract that says I have to teach in public high school after graduation. This is a program that the government did to fix the teacher shortage problem due to curriculum shift. Back then, we have K-10 and we shifted to K-12, increasing the number of years students need before going to college. 

Now I got assigned to a science high school during the pandemic. It was an easy job at first because the kids are very gifted and intelligent and I have no problems with them picking up lessons. They are also self-sustaining which means they study on their own unprompted. Here, I can rely on me lecturing all the time. However, since we are now back in full classroom mode and ditching the online setup, I am having a hard time adjusting. Teaching in real classroom is very different in online teaching. I have relied too much on my lecturing ability that I realize that we can finish the entire curriculum ahead of time. One thing that changed with my methods is incorporating lab works(assisted with worksheets) as I teach biology and research but now I am running  out of ideas how to elongate some lessons. 

With that said, how do I unlearn my methods and be more ""fun"" and ""engaging""? I recently got into involving case studies in class to promote inquiry, however I am having hard time planning or figuring it out how to deliver, without me reverting to full on lecturing.

72,So if American students are so bad...,"What does that bode for the future?

I am focusing on American students here because that's what I know best and that's what I often see discussed here in dire terms. Given that, if literacy, numeracy, orderly behavior, and attention span are as poor as is frequently asserted here: what does that bode for the future?

Since I have a teen I spend some time in the super-competitive environs of r/ApplyingToCollege where it seems ""everyone"" has an SAT score >1550 and an international math Olympiad medal, plus they've published research and founded a non-profit (!!!!) There the plaint is about how *incredibly* selective universities have become, and how hard it is to get accepted to a reasonably challenging college or university.

Here, the plaint is all about the fragmented attention, atrocious behavior, and appallingly low academic level of the average American student.

I wonder, fairly often, about the world in which my now-teen will reach adulthood. She's somewhere in between those two extremes, closer to the A2C end of the spectrum. She's academically high-achieving and well behaved, and she goes to a small school where the same can be said for the entire student body.

What's it going to be like, if so many (the majority???) of her generation are going to be undereducated and resentful? Why is it that, if that's the case, it seems so darn hard to get into our state university system??? I'm not talking the Ivy League here, just the University of California?!

How's society supposed to work? I struggle to imagine.

Now only work with smaller groups of students, I still enjoy my students, but I find I'm not putting in as much effort as I used to .  I say no to a lot of extra school activities or begrudgingly and unhappily say yes to a few. I'm pretty unmotivated and working to levels a lot lower than I used to.

Beginning of school year had some horrible micromanagement and I think just not being treated like a professional who's been teaching Ten years and knows what I'm doing was the straw that broke the camel's back (if that point were different I'd likely be in a different place now.l).

I’ve had teachers that are  passionate about making a difference in education. I was never good at school despite being smart. But I have always wanted to be an advocate or help kids like myself. The ones who feel completely hopeless and crushed.. and get more helpless every single year. I was always seen as a nice kid but Ik there r kids labeled as bad who deep down want to do well too.

103,Where do I start?,"Greetings all!

I'm interested in becoming a teacher. I think I need a change.

I'm a foster care worker for DSS and I enjoy working with the kiddos and family on my case load - however I'm experiencing some burnout. Mostly when dealing with families who wont get their shit together and its taxing mentally. 

My wife brought up the thought of teaching. I have my BA in Human Services, and have been out of a school setting for nearly a decade - but I believe its something I would enjoy. I'm also looking for something where I'll have more time with my wife and kids where I wont necessarily be distracted while I'm clocked out. 

I've already weighed pros and cons with the idea, and I'm confident that this is something I am wanting to pursue. 

I'm in SC, so all I would need is to go through a program such as PACE since I have a BA correct?

106,Rowdy 5th grade Class- looking for advice,"I'm a first year IS  with a sub license (i.e. no formal training for the role, getting paid less than half what a licensed IS would make) and I do genuinely love the job and will be pursuing a masters in special education when I have the opportunity to do so. However, for now, peers and mentors are the only resource I have for advice and guidance and the rest of the faculty are at a bit of a loss with this class.

We have a fifth grade class (20 students) who's majority is students who are scoring very low on reading, not quite as low on math, and their behavior speaks to them struggling. They talk constantly, are out of their seats constantly, and when corrected they usually finish whatever it is they wanted to do first before returning to expectations. Their classroom teacher can't manage to get them to the bathroom and back without frustration, let alone get them through a whole lesson. 

These kids are clearly struggling with impulse control, among other things. We have a counselor involved with some of them. Several of them are my students and outside of the group they work wonderfully and seem motivated to learn. But as a whole class it's becoming seriously demoralizing for their classroom teachers. 

Does anyone have experience with these types of groups and advice on ways to engage them or manage their behaviors in that group setting? The only answer I keep coming back to is they need smaller groups and that's just not an option at this school.

115,Switching from HS to MS,"Hi everyone.

I've spent my whole career (7 years) as a high school ELA teacher with my most recent year seeing me switch from ELA to high school history. However, I just accepted a position to switch to teaching middle school social studies. I haven't really taught MS since I did my student teaching, but I love teaching 9th graders and (in the country I'm in now) 10th graders because I love teaching them how to be high school students. With how much I enjoy teaching 9th and 10th grade rather than juniors and seniors (11th and 12th grade), I am pretty certain that I'll love teaching MS. 

&#x200B;

However, what should I expect moving from HS to MS? Is there anything I might have forgotten or never experienced that I might face moving into this new position? Also, what is the purpose of MS? I love that I can always explain to my students the ways in which the skills I'm teaching can transfer into either college or careers, I find it difficult to think of the big picture end goal for MS besides preparing them for HS.

118,New teacher needing advice,"Hi everyone!

I got interested in teaching as , for the last several years, I have been tutoring high school mathematics. This was on a casual basis - just texting the parents, no set times (we'd always work out a suitable time at the start of the week, and would miss inconvenient weeks), working around their schedule. I never made it my profession. I never fully learnt the curriculum (I was 80% proficient with it); but at the same time I was good at what I did. I would sit there and genuinely learn with the students. We would discuss questions and work our way to the end. If I wasn't sure how to lead it, I would lead them into the right trails of thought (scaffolding maybe). If we were wrong we'd discuss the mistake, and how to avoid it next time. We would develop deeper patterns of thought and thinking than what would've been if I had just taught the straight equations. This wasn't perfect for everyone, so I adapted to their individual needs. However, I saw much more drastic and lasting results (mathematically) with the younger students, and cognitively with my older ones, when they did follow these trails of thought (e.g asking why does this do this, why does this do that. I assume it draws on prior learning and ensures everything is over learnt? Not sure, never thought deeply into it). For students who struggled with their teachers at school, I taught them how to manage and get better at that relationship, so they would be more open to learning from them. My students often went into exams seeing it more as a challenge than as a test, and became relatively excited (and proud) when they got better results. However, I think I acknowledged that a test score can be a lousy indicator of their learnings, as for some students it really depends how they feel on the day. As such, I wouldn't track their progress and map their results.

For the time being, I am really comfortable in my way of teaching. I find it comfortable enough to thrive on it, but mysterious enough to want to keep going back to tutoring on the side of my life.

With such a need to be the teacher the student needs, am I entering teaching for the wrong reasons? Will it be unsustainable?  
Is there a different area of education I could specialize in for my style and areas of teaching, or will I have to adapt to all styles (I think I'd like to master one before I move to learning all)?  
Am I a fraud of an educator because I didn't track and map out my students progress?  
Also, how strong and influential is the need for ""subject expertise"" in teaching?

My long term gig was HS English, all I have done up to that point was day to day sub so the fact that I got thrown into that was something else.

Like I said I learned a lot like entering grades and things of that nature. Luckily I got left lesson plans, and followed them the best I could. I don’t know how to teach but one thing I did right was connect with those kids. I’m just a guy that got thrown into a position like that but I’m taking that victory of my rapport with the kiddos. Some of the seniors even say that they want to invite me to their graduation, and that means alot. One of them even asked for my email so they could let me know about their future accomplishments.

I never wanted to be friends with the kids, I just leaned on the fact that I’m new and I ended up relating to most of those seniors. I’m not a good teacher, I didn’t do anything, however the fact that some of those seniors said they’d miss me and want to keep in touch is a feather in my cap.

I have a completely opposite issue. Here’s the thing. I work at a private school which got a lot of funding when the school was newly built in 2019. Because of this each class (quite big) has it’s own bathroom in a corner. There’s water dispenser inside the class. Kids bring their own food which they eat in classrooms. All is fine except this means kids stay in the class from 6.30 to 12. Then again from 12.25 until 2.30. I am one of the few teachers who see an issue with this. Keeping 12-16 year olds in class for all of school session. With each grade level higher, physical activity classes are reduced to fit in more academic classes to prep them for exams. I have one of the oldest grades (class teacher) and the kids are for most part very well behaved (most of them have never as much as back talked to me ) but absolutely hate any sort of physical activity. Its getting worse every year. Even when they have free periods and given the choice to go out, they’d rather stay in the class and do nothing just because. They’d rather stay cold than go down the hallway to get the remote for AC to turn it up. Half the boys in my class are over weight and obese. School board and parents see no issue because half the kids are A and A* students. I have kids who would stuff paper balls or other little trash in their bag to avoid walking 10 steps to the dustbin.

Forgive me if this isn’t following guidelines, I checked and I think I’m in the clear. For context: I just recently had parent teacher conferences with a parent whose elementary student is doing well academically, albeit a bit below grade level in one academic area. In the conference with the mom, I explain the grades, our academic plan for the year, and she asked questions, which I answered to the best of my ability.

The very next day, I find out that she has called my school principal and accused me of calling her daughter stupid (I never once said anything like that or anything that implied that). Now my school principal wants me to meet with the principal and parent to discuss an issue that still hasn’t been communicated to me. The parent has not reached out to me, and my principal has yet to explain to me why I have to meet with the parent.

How do I handle this? Is there a way I can prevent this from happening in the future? Before this the mom had been polite and respectful with me, and there seemed to be no issues.

Edit: Thank you so much for the helpful advice! Those who suggested that the parent was projecting based on her own bad educational experiences were right- after cussing out our school principal and secretary, the student’s mom chose to just stop sending her kid to school, and move her to another school- the third school in three years.

I was emergency certified right out of college in 2017 and never got the opportunity to complete  observations and student teach. Essentially, I was thrown to the wolves. That being said, one of the main things that I have consistently struggled with all 6 years of teaching has been disciplining my students. In situations where a student needs to be sent to the office, or just removed from the classroom, I will usually just laugh it off, or shut down, depending on the situation. I’ve never really known how to react in situations where a student needs to be removed from the classroom. Sometimes I feel embarrassed if I get on to a kid, even though I SHOULDN’T. I know that I am the adult in the room, and I ultimately have the authority, but I just care sooo much about what they think of me and I feel like this is why I have such trouble with discipline. I’ve always said that I wish I could picture these scenarios in someone else’s classroom so that I can see how another teacher would react. I feel like I should have this all figured out by now, but it is just a constant struggle each year & I’m afraid that it will ultimately cost me my job.

Hope my title made any sense at all. I’m currently taking my master’s degree into becoming a teacher in Norway, and I’m planning on writing my master thesis about how different countries deal with countering radicalization/extremism in school, focused on age 13-16 (or High school in US). I'm going to compare Norway, England and Washington. I’m not too familiar with the education system in US, so I would greatly appreciate some guidance here. I’m looking for some documents that's important for education in Washington, that the teacher uses as guidance in social studies. I will the compare it to the English and Norwegian ones. I’ll try to explain what I need below.

I’m going to do a thematic analysis of primarily statutory documents, required by law to follow as a teacher, that talks about learning goals or values that the pupil should learn. Based on these documents, I’ll look at how each country/state tries to counter extremism/terrorism/radicalism.

I’m going to choose social studies as a primarily subject to compare between these countries, but I’m also going to use documents that is relevant for every subject, if that exists is.

I’ve chosen Washington because it had a nice structure of learning goals that is easier to compare in my opinion.

These are what I think would be relevant:

**1.** **The Social Studies K-12 Learning Standards**

3. **Preventing Violent Extremism in Schools**

a. [https://publicintelligence.net/fbi-extremism-schools/](https://publicintelligence.net/fbi-extremism-schools/) (website with pdf on the side)

b. This is probably for the every state, including Washington?

Is my 3rd document above here (FBI) relevant for Washington? Are there any other that are better? Are there any documents I’ve forgotten about?

I’m not asking for help with my analysis. I primarily want guidance on which documents are relevant to analyze. The US education system is a bit different from the one i know in Norway.

135,"Since when is ""hush"" disrespectful?","I've been dealing with a group of 7th graders who are wilder than normal. I have to redirect them three times more than the students I had last year. Talking during quiet times (journals, quizzes, etc.), is endemic. As such, I'm telling people to be quiet more.

Sometimes, my most disruptive students talk back SO much that I have to raise my voice and shout ""Hush"" or ""Shut your mouths.""

I get why shut up or shut it could be considered disrespectful (like they're respecting the classroom or our time), but since when is ""hush"" disrespectful?",yl11hh,104,115,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/yl11hh/since_when_is_hush_disrespectful/,teaching
136,Abuse and crazy esa in school. Am I the only one or this is “normal”?,"Hello everyone. I think I’ve never posted here. I am an instructor at a public school. Meaning I work as a teachers assistant/ tutor in the classroom. I help different teachers and see many many students everyday. Yesterday one of the teachers in the last bell of the day, yelled so so so loud and scary to a kid/group of kids that it triggered me and freaked me out. I understand why he did that, these kids are so so so so disrespectful. They treat this teacher like trash. They NEVER stop talking. To the point that it feels impossible for him to just go through a short lesson. I often feel sorry for him and don’t know what to do. I am not supposed to “discipline” kids or teach if that makes sense. What makes me so sad is not that all the kids are this awful, is just a few that do not want to learn at all. These kids just are looking for excusss to leave the classroom (bathroom, water, computer “broke”, library…). And in class, they’re just gossiping, or playing with others, or bothering other kids or making jokes… it’s insane. When a few of these bad ones don’t come, the classroom is heaven. And is always the same group of kids. I feel like they don’t care about passing because they know even if they fail, they will pass anyway. I can tell this kids are abused at home. I studied in school a lot of psychology and how abuse shows up in peoples behavior. I can tell they’re being neglected and abused at home. One of the things I see is how they don’t respond to anything but abuse. The only way they will stop misbehaving, disrespecting is if you abuse them back. If you yell or insult. Asking normally doesn’t work. 

One of the things that disturbed me yesterday was that after the teacher yelled (literally like an animal, like a lion or some wild animal) the whole class was quite, you could cut the tension in the room. However, one of the kids that was misbehaving started laughing!!!! Laughing!!! I looked at him and asked him: “why are you laughing??” He said “because is funny”. As if that was their intension, to make the teacher this angry. The crazy thing is that the teacher was just trying to make the class quite for a test. They had a test and would not stop talking. 

This level of craziness doesn’t happen in all classes. Most of the teachers I help have years pf experience and they can control the kids to an extend of course. But something I see is that the teachers need to be abusive to the kids in order to teach because otherwise, the kids will abuse them. Like the teacher who yelled. I feel so weird about all this. Sometimes I feel like I’m in a prison for the way some kids behave. I remember being a kid and I wasn’t like that. 

Another thing is that Kids are all day everyday talking about porn. They think is funny to mourn (I think that’s the right word, not sure) like in porn videos. They do that ALL day. I find kids watching the most disturbing stuff on their computers and on their phone. To the point I am scared of looking what someone’s phone while they’re using it. Is like they’re so dissensitide to stuff on a screen. There is one kid that comes high to school. He’s high in school!!!!!! You can tell he’s high!!! And pretty much there’s nothing the school can do. I now hate the smell of weed because of the amount of kids I’m tutoring and I’m in close proximity to them who smell sooo bad and smell like weed so much!! I often wonder if is because they smoke it or their parents. What I find crazy is these are middle schoolers!!!! I don’t understand what type of parent smokes around their kids!!!????? To the point that their kid is a walking weed smelling machine?? 

Sorry for my long vent. I’m honestly thinking that if I ever have kids, I won’t send them to public school. Sorry for my long vent",ykzw1o,60,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/ykzw1o/abuse_and_crazy_esa_in_school_am_i_the_only_one/,teaching

138,Cancelling my student tomorrow,"I just accepted two students, one in Kinder and the other in college for a science I took.

I had my Kinder for three days in a row, two hours in the evening. Doesn't sound so bad until I have to wrangle this kid to sit correctly every five minutes and we take nearly half the time to finish an assignment. We take a brain break then it's like pulling teeth to get them to practice any worksheet (hopefully some games will solve that but I digress.) I have to evaluate this child so myself and their mother can speak to the school counselor about academic performance 

So I thought my college student would be something more.... like an enhancement or I'm a fresh pair of eyes, I guess. The last piece of the puzzle. Nope. I have to re-teach and make sure they maintain their B. I ask what they have tried. They haven't even tried taking their own notes out of the textbook. The professor is shitty, to be fair, but it's so deep in the semester at this point to now ask for help. By shitty, I mean a ""everything in the book is fair game even the random fun fact"" and does not teach anything from it. 

That deeply worried me because I know their program is insanely competitive. B is not enough, an A won't even guarantee you in. But at the time I thought, why not try? Well, I'm literally reliving college by writing their notes and quizlets at 12 am. Have been for every hour I wasn't sleeping or planning or dissociating on the couch.

I know, I don't want to easy someone's hard, so I won't. I know I underestimated myself. I know this is a lesson to be had, but I let them down. I hope sending my final resources will be an alright send off

139,Teaching With a Lisp + Disability,"I've recently been told that I should under no circumstances go into the field of working with children because I'll never be able to keep a classroom under control when I have a lisp, because students won't respect me because of it.

I also occasionally use a cane. As well, I am trans, and don't pass.

From my point of view, exposing children to people with a diverse range of abilities will build empathy. And to me, not expecting children to respect someone based on physical ability is just a completely awful thing to expect. Saying that you can't expect students to respect someone who has a lisp, or someone who uses a cane, is just extremely ableist - everyone deserves respect, regardless of their physical ability.",ykrze8,10,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/ykrze8/teaching_with_a_lisp_disability/,teaching

141,What are fun activities to teach formal and informal language to 12 to 13 year olds?,"Hey! 

I would like to apologize for all the grammatical mistakes, I'm still learning English. :)

For my internship, I have to teach a lesson about formal and informal language, to 12 to 13 year olds. My mentor expects me to do something active (like a game or something, just something to activate the students).

I wanted to start with a role play whereby one student plays the principal (or another ""important"" person) and the other student plays a student. They will both receive a dialogue from me which they have to read in front of the class. The student's text will be very informal, as if he were talking to a friend. 
Then we will do the same exercise, but the two students play friends. The dialogue will be very formal.
Then I would ask the rest of the class what was wrong with these conversations, so that I could come to the subject of the lesson.

After I explained the differences between formal and informal language, I wanted to divide the room in two sections: ""formal"" and ""informal"". I wanted to show the class some phrases/e-mails/letters/... and they have to go to the right section of the classroom. 

Do you think this is a nice and fun idea? Should I let the two students in front of the class improvise a dialogue, instead of just giving them one? (I don't think they're capable of that, most of my students are migrants and not so good at languages.)

Do you have any other ideas to make this lesson active and fun?

146,I am looking for a language-teaching (English/German/Spanish) mentor,"Hey everyone,

This post might seem like a lot to ask, but I'll give it a go anyway.

I'm a 19-year-old language teacher (teaching German (DaF) at a language school in Germany), and I'm probably one of the youngest language teachers you can find. Last year I took Cambridge's CELTA course and passed with Pass B, and I've been teaching German for half a year in Chile and here in Germany (A1-C1). 

All my students seem to love me (I only get positive feedback despite urging them to include (constructive) negative feedback), and I generally enjoy teaching. However, sometimes there are things that I don't know how to handle, but my teaching books, tutors, and the internet can typically resolve these questions and doubts.

However, my students often tell me about other teachers and how much they dislike the class. I know those are subjective comments, but some of the things they tell me still make me wonder why people teach like that. 

The most recent example is giving an A2 intensive course (4x 45 minutes every day) dozens of new verbs every day without context and their past forms to memorise, plus two to three hours of homework every day, which even the best students can't keep up with because they also need to work and have a life (who would've thought). They complained to me that despite trying, they keep forgetting all the new verb forms because they never revise them and keep going, resulting in a highly frustrating learning experience.

Another example is the same teacher telling them they will never succeed in learning German and that they suck. I know there are some weaker and stronger students in that class, but even with my experience of just half a year, I can tell that this is absolute bs and will only worsen things. 

I also have some doubts and questions concerning my Spanish teacher at uni, which I'd like to discuss with someone with more experience.

&#x200B;

I used to discuss these questions with a friend who also happened to be a DELTA instructor and cognitive linguist teaching at uni, but this is no longer possible due to personal reasons.

Now, **I am looking for someone with experience in teaching English, Spanish or German, preferably someone that goes above and beyond in what they do. I'd like you to be my mentor** and help me with questions about teaching, especially to understand other teachers and draw conclusions from their behaviour to improve my own teaching.

148,Advice needed for Illinois Teaching Licensure. Masters vs Bachelors Degree for HS Math teacher.,"I live in Illinois and know the teaching requirements vary by state. I graduated with an economics degree in May 2021. I've been substitute teaching since 2018 and recently started long-term subbing. I'd like to go back and get my teaching licensure to teach HS math (and econ), but don't know the correct steps.

In Illinois, Northwestern has a Masters program where you receive your teaching licensure after graduation. I've looked at bachelor programs for teaching with a licensure after graduation too, but I would prefer a Masters since I already have an econ bachelors. I could finish either program within 1 1/2 to 2 years so I'm not worried on time. It's more about not wanting 2 bachelors. However, I've heard that if I get a Masters I will be overqualified and thus, no one will hire me.

164,Need advice on how to deal with tough situation,"Hi Everyone:

I am a Speech adjunct professor at a community college. I have been having one of my toughest semesters yet. In my early afternoon section my students have been very disruptive, such as showing up late, leaving early disruptively, talking in class, and being on their laptops. I have also had a lot of attendance issues with this class and with students not handing in their assignments. I have not had this issue with my other classes nor any class for that matter. I try to be supportive and encouraging and work my tail off to help my students succeed, such as offering to meet them to help them and encouraging them to hand in their work and telling them that I care and want them to succeed. Students in this particular class could care less and don’t want to be here and have made it known.

I met with the Dean today as he needed to meet with me as he is observing my class next week due to all instructors get observed and it will be the class with the issues. He mentioned in the meeting today that there have been a few complaints from the class with all of the issues, such as they don’t like that I use APA not MLA even though mostly all the instructors in the college use APA, that they don’t like that I lecture and my style even though I do incorporate activities and discussions yet students don’t want to participate, and that I am vague in my emails even though students don’t come to me for help even when I encourage them to come to me so I can help him. He also said that a student made an accusation that I shook my finger in their face which I did not do. I did tell the Dean that I did not do this and I did start to cry because I couldn’t believe what was said. And he said well I know you wouldn’t do this and that you are a good person, I just heard it second hand from a staff member and didn’t actually talk to the student. He also said that it is mainly a few students complaining and these are students who are very disruptive and are currently failing. Go figure I know but I am really hurting.

I do need to note that I am vision and hearing impaired and students often I am afraid target my disability and have poked fun at it. I did finally open up to the Dean about my disability and did mention that I am sometimes targeted as a result and he did say that he will not stand for this if discrimination is the case.

I did kindly tell the Dean today about my concerns with that class. I also gave him a nice email about everything that has been going on. I also sent him some documentation including emails that I have sent students to show that I am clarifying and wanting to help students, student feedback that shows that students like my class and see me as caring and just an overall great teacher. I also showed him some examples of student work so he could see students are learning from me and also a couple of emails from students this semester asking for recommendations as they really like my class and me as an instructor. I didn’t hear from him yet but it is a Friday.

I am just so terrified about next week. I am scared to teach my lesson because of all that was said which are not true and I did give the Dean quite a bit of proof to back me up. I am just going to go up there and give it my all and really show the Dean what I can do and what all my students see and know about me as a teacher. I have high evals and highly positive student feedback about me being one of the most kindest instructors they have known. It just really hurt me and I am still crying as I write this that a student would say I shook my finger at their face when they know I didn’t. I know the Dean knows I didn’t do this but it just heartbreaks me to know a student would make up something but I do have several students who would back me up.

If any of you have advice or stories to share I would love to hear it. I would really love to hear your thoughts on this issue and what you would do. Again I am really scared about next week and I am sure this will be on the back of my mind when I teach with the Dean in the class but I am going to show him and I can do this.

172,The Top 9 Brain Foods for Studying and Exams,"The Top 9 Brain Foods for Studying and Exams

When you’re a student trying to memorize and understand a lot of new information, it’s important to keep your health in top shape. Staying healthy can promote academic performance and help you reach your educational goals.

Although an overall healthy diet is most important for keeping your body and brain nourished and ready to take on difficult tasks, research shows that certain foods may be especially important for brain health and promoting mental performance.

The following foods have been linked to improved brain health and make excellent choices when you’re cramming for an exam.

Here are the top 9 brain foods for studying.

1. Berries
Berries are rich in a variety of compounds that may help promote academic performance and protect the health of your brain. Berries, including blueberries, strawberries, and blackberries, are especially high in flavonoid compounds called anthocyanins.

2. Citrus fruits 
Citrus fruits are highly nutritious, and their intake has been linked to a variety of health benefits, including the promotion of brain health.

Similarly to berries, citrus fruits like oranges and grapefruit are rich in flavonoids, including hesperidin, naringin, quercetin, and rutin, among others.

These compounds may have the ability to promote learning and memory, as well as protect nerve cells from injury, therefore warding off mental decline

3. Dark chocolate and cocoa products
Cocoa has the highest flavonoid content by weight of any other food, which is why cocoa products like chocolate significantly contribute to dietary flavonoid intake. Consuming flavonoid-rich cocoa products may favorably affect brain health.

In one study, 90 older adults with mild mental impairment drank a cocoa beverage containing either 45 mg, 520 mg, or 990 mg of cocoa flavonoids per serving once a day for 8 weeks.


4. Nuts 
Nuts are packed with nutrients that are essential for brain health, including vitamin E and zinc. They’re also portable and versatile, making them an excellent choice for study snacks.
Nuts are concentrated sources of healthy fat, protein, and fiber, and they can help keep you fueled throughout marathon study sessions. Plus, some research shows that snacking on nuts may even help improve certain aspects of brain function.

5. Eggs
Eggs are often referred to as nature’s multivitamin due to the variety of nutrients they contain. They’re particularly rich in nutrients that are necessary for brain function, including vitamin B12, choline, and selenium.

6. Avocados 
Avocados are versatile fruits that can be enjoyed in several ways, including mashed into guacamole, spread on toast, or simply enjoyed whole with a bit of salt. As a convenient study snack, they may also help boost your brain function.

They’re an excellent source of lutein, a carotenoid that accumulates in your brain and eyes and may positively influence brain function


7. Fish
Omega-3s are essential fats that play important roles in brain health. They’re concentrated in fatty fish, which are also excellent sources of other brain-health-promoting nutrients like vitamin B12 and selenium.

It’s no surprise that a number of studies have linked fish intake to enhanced brain function.


8. Beets
Beets and beet products are rich in nitrates, which your body converts into a molecule called nitric oxide. Nitric oxide plays many important roles in your health, including proper nerve cell communication, blood flow, and brain function.


9. Red, green, and orange vegetables
Vegetable intake in general is associated with better brain function and the promotion of overall health.

Red, orange, and green vegetables, including peppers, carrots, and broccoli, contain a variety of beneficial plant compounds, including carotenoid pigments, that have been shown to benefit mental performance..",yfp5id,0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/yfp5id/the_top_9_brain_foods_for_studying_and_exams/,teaching

I waited for the home room teacher to finish his part of the lecture before pointing it out as it was currently calm and I didn't want to cause a bug commotion and scare the kids (or the wasp, in hindsight). 

He immediately went over, cleared the closest kids away and managed to send it out the window carefully. However, I'm now kicking myself for the delay. I was just thinking about handling it carefully as it didn't feel like an immediate threat, since the wasp seemed calm. But the wasps over here can be really aggressive and more venomous than the usual (which I forgot at the time). There were some kids below the window, but it was sticking to the upper area.

183,5 Reasons why You’re Not Connecting With Your Students and What You Can Do About It!,"5 Reasons why You’re Not Connecting With Your Students and What You Can Do About It!

Sometimes when I think about my first year of teaching, I cringe so hard I think my vertebrae are going to crack. I wish I had the addresses of where those students are now. I want to send them apology letters and baskets of crackers and fine cheeses.

I totally understand your frustrations with me, the letters will say. I get it now. I’m sorry I wasn’t a better teacher for you. Please accept these snacks and my sincere wishes that you’re happy and thriving. Love, Ms. Treleaven

During that first year, I couldn’t see that I was doing anything wrong. I was nice to my students, I respected them—why wasn’t that returned to me? It never occurred to me that—just like with peers my own age—relationships with students aren’t transactional. (Note: Even if relationships were transactional, my smiling and greeting them at the door is not an equal exchange for having to sit through 60 minutes of my poorly planned lessons in which I had very weak classroom management.)

1. You’re still learning how to manage a classroom.
I remember a college class where another student kept interrupting and talking over other people in the class, even the professor. As the course went on, I found myself being increasingly irritated not only with the student, but also with my professor for not redirecting this blockhead so we all could, you know, learn. (Note: We really need to bring back the word blockhead. Consider this my leading the charge.)

It’s the same way for our students. If you’re not setting boundaries or enforcing the expectations you set, they’ll grow frustrated and impatient.

2. You aren’t listening to them.
Students do a lot of listening to you. But how much listening do you do to them? If your classroom is one where you do the vast majority of the talking, consider these options to show students they are being heard:
a . Make classroom discussions a regular
 habit.
b. Ask for feedback regularly. 
c. Consider building community through structured informal questions.

3. You need to take a hard look at your biases and motivations.
Students are way more perceptive than we give them credit for. They can smell from a mile away if their teacher:

Cares more about compliance than connection
Chooses to teach at a low-income school for bragging rights
Believes that they’re intellectually, morally, or culturally superior to their students
Comes in with a savior complex to “fix” or “save”
Is uninterested or judgmental about the unique personhood of their students.

4. You’re afraid to look foolish.
During professional development several years ago, I told a story to my table mates during a break. I’d been cranky at school that past week and stopped class to apologize to my students. One of the teachers at the table scoffed.

“You apologized to them? I’ve never once apologized to my students and I’ve been teaching for 20 years,” he said.

“Wow!” I said. “Twenty years without making a single mistake in front of your students? That’s amazing! What’s your secret?”

He didn’t pick up on my cheekiness.

5. You have forgotten the Golden Rule of Teaching.
Much of the hatred for teachers can boil down to forgetting the Golden Rule of Teaching: Teach the way you would want to be taught. I’m not talking from a learning-styles perspective (or my classes would be silent reading in the dark with lo-fi hip-hop playing, aka the way I like to work and learn), but more from a leadership perspective. When you find yourself annoyed by a leader, check yourself to make sure you’re not doing that to your students.

So come December I will be certified to teach grades K-8 and have the ability to have my own classroom in January (finishing up student teaching at the moment)

I am trying to decide between two options. I can finish school and be certified and teach next spring, or I can finish my master's degree. I only have to take 4 classes (12 credit hours) to get finish the degree. I would take four classes and teach full time, but I don't see this as a healthy option and don't want to ruin my first ""semester"" teaching by taking on such a large workload.

To complicate things further, I am moving at the end of next spring back to my home state so I am worried on transferring a license and getting hired with 0 experience with a master's degree.

So my options are - 1) finish degree in the spring taking four classes while working as a para (and hope I get hired in new state after I move come Fall 2023)

Or 2) Work as a teacher for the spring semester, aqcuiring some experience before my move - hopefully giving me the edge on getting hired with having something to back it up.

Another issue I am worried about is at my current college in the state I live in I only need 12 hours to complete the degree, however the college at my home state requires a much different set of classes to obtain the same degree, basically meaning I would have to take around 36 credit hours classes to finish my degree. Only a certain amount of credit hours would transfer.

190,Grading help. CTE elective in middle school.,"So..... first time teacher. I teach several CTE elective related to service industry and culinary in a middle school. The school's expectation is to keep the kiddos happy and keep them in the classroom. I was told by many teachers in the same school who teach similar classes that the school doesn't care what we teach, no micromanaging at all, lots of freedom, if kids are happy, school is happy. So far we are happy.

However, with so much freedom, I feel stuck with grading. I'm as generous as I can ever be. But if kiddos don't submit assignment, I can't give any point. Therefore they get a zero. There are 30% kids who don't do shit. I give them endless attempts to improve grades, due dates are in 2-3 weeks, even accept late submissions with no deduction TO GIVE THEM GOOD GRADES. Every day reminder to just do smth and submit smth so I can give them credits away. Those still don't do shit. Some are ELLs(but they don't even attempt to use Chromebook translation extension. Some are SPED kids, even though I follow their IEPs, extended time and all that, some SPED kids don't understand the concept at all, or have absolutely no intention to do any work, unless I'm 1:1 with them. But 1:1. isn't possible since I have average 8 SPED kids each period and I teach 7 periods every day. All my classroom assignments are online.) I hate to call their parents because they don't care, and they are fkin rude.

Nope. I won't.

I know at the end of the day school won't be happy with so many 0s. Parents will be pissed if their kids fail an elective. But the admin won't tell me to give away free credits for no work.

195,Student keeps rambling on in class,"So I work as a ""tutor"" for an after school program with 4th graders and Im not sure what to do about this child who keeps rambling on in class. I do allow the kids to have a voice (raise their concerns, let the other kids know what they've learned and stuff like that with my permission.) However I do have a child who uses this time to tell stories. For example I'll be teaching the student the difference between reptiles and amphibians and he will raise his hand and tells me that he has something very important to add on. I'll give him permission to speak and it'll be something like ""Ok sooooo when I was at the park yesterday...yeah yesterday and I saw a lizard and I went to go grab it but but it like ran away so I uuumm tried to chase it but I lost it. Yeah I couldn't find it so."" At this point I'll stop him and ask if this story has anything to do with what we are learning and sometimes he'll pause it for a few seconds before responding no or he'll pause his story and then continue on about how he tried to find the lizard again. Or I'll be trying to get the kids lined up to be in time for snack and he raises his hand asking me if he can tell me something because it's important. I'll give him permission and he'll say something like ""Ok so what I wanted to tell you is I woke up today this morning and I got ready really fast because I had my clothes ready in the morning so can I tell the whole class how they can get ready fast in the morning before going to school?"" I don't want to make him lose his confidence in speaking out but I also can't be having him stall time because he wants to talk about things he did especially since I'm only with the kids for 3 hours and we have to get things done as well. 
What have you guys done about kids who like to talk a lot about things that don't contribute to what is being done at the moment?

Edit: I completely forgot there isn't exactly an after school time. In the program their parents can pick them up anytime they want it just has to be by 6pm.

Our government is proudly posting budgetary surpluses by starving public education like crazy - not enough support in schools compounded by the pursuit of equality disguised as equity to cut costs and reduce the bottom line has made managing a class - let alone actually teaching them - increasingly difficult.

Like, yea, and I bet she also beat the kids with a ruler. Sigh, so frustrating. The past was immeasurably harder in many ways, but I would take starting a woodstove over the crap I deal with any day.

198,Does anyone else struggle with teaching the formal outline process?,"To give some context, I teach in a specialized program in my school. These students apply to the program and must have honors level grades because it is an honors program for college bound students. These students usually go on to Ivy League or other big name universities with partial or full academic scholarships, so arguably, they're very intelligent. I teach 10th grade honors English.

I'm struggling to teach them the outline process. They just don't seem to understand how the information is organized and how to look at an example I've created on a different topic in order to see how it should look in the end. Lots of confusion and lots of emails. I've been teaching for 10 years and have great relationships with my students, so I know that's not the issue. The reason I'm requiring them to learn how to do a formal outline is because I had many professors who required me to use one in various subject areas, so I think it's a skill they should learn in high school, and it serves as pre-writing before the draft process.

Has anyone here had success in teaching formal outlines? If so, what was your strategy? Slowly but surely we are getting there, but I'd really like some tips and tricks for the students at the lower end of the honors spectrum or those who transferred into this program this year and didn't get any experience with outlines, MLA, or formal essay writing last year.",ybmfgt,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/ybmfgt/does_anyone_else_struggle_with_teaching_the/,teaching
199,Creating Sub Plans,"Full-time substitute teacher here. Just curious on how teachers go about putting together sub plans especially on short notice. 

I am a frequent sub at one of the elementary schools and I am always amazed that they can put together a four page sub plan on short notice including this week when a first grade teacher was sick whose class I covered for two days. The sub plan was waiting for me each morning, printed off and on the desk, handouts were already printed and stacked, books selected to read to the kids, the schedule in place like when and where to take them to and pick them up from specials, etc.

Do teachers come in at night to drop off the plans and print and organize the materials? Or are they sent to admin to print off,  especially if the teachers are out sick?

I have heard of emergency sub plans but never had to use one-that I know of. 

It's a different story when I sub middle and high school. It's usually some variation on ""have the students go online to X on Schoology, complete, and submit the assignment."" 

As a sub though some plans can get a bit extreme like one I had for 5th grade a few weeks ago that was over eight pages long with lots of details and hard to comprehend, even though I arrived 45 minutes early to review it.",yb617o,26,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/yb617o/creating_sub_plans/,teaching

They only really know basic multiplication and division. We're going into multiplying/dividing decimals and fractions. They get a calculator for everything. 

When we get into this unit, I know they're going to struggle so much with the normal way of multiplying, writing everything out. Would you go through the process to try and get them to learn how to multiply this way or just let them use the calculator, then teach them where the decimal place goes? We're only spending about a week covering all of decimals and fractions multiplying/dividing. I know division is going to be a whole other level of a beast in and of itself if I do long division.

This is my first year as a teacher in this area with students with disabilities in math at this low level in middle school. I don't have much help from others since I am the only one teaching this class.

Kids these days seem to be under the impression that if they do enough work, but not necessarily correct work, then their grade improves.

Not. For. Math. Your grade is based on proficiency. Period. Failed my test? You get to take another one. Fail it again? Then your grade reflects that. Yet all the time kids who are failing want extra credit assignments and extra work, that they can take home, cheat on, get help with, or just turn it in with wrong answers and expect them to get a passing grade. Keep in mind this is not practice to get better, it’s to circumvent taking an actual summative assessment. 

And don’t even get me started on the trend of students asking to not take the test because they’re not feeling it.

It breaks my heart that they don’t care because I truly am trying to give them all the best education because they deserve it!

When it comes to school holidays, the teachers and whole staff do not have off. The teachers only get off at the end of the year Christmas holidays for 2 weeks, at most. If we do wish to take holidays during any other holiday period, we have to put in paid leave days. Is this how school holidays work for teachers? Because some of my teacher friends have every school holiday off, and just have to go back one or two days before school begins to ensure their work is ready.

I'm also still studying, and my work doesn't offer study leave for when we have an exam, and instead have to use our paid leave, which for me is unpaid leave because I'm still on probation.

217,how to deal with behavioral problem (attitude),"i recently started as a tutor and one of my students (10 year old girl) has a very poor attitude problem. she has behaved this way since my very first ""free trial"" class with her, after barely 20 minutes of speaking with her. i could be overthinking but i saw she just looked over what i was wearing and this was when the attitude started (i wear fairly neutral non offensive clothes).

kids have to walk in, turn on their keyboards/mouse/screen, either that or the tutor does it for them. but she literally just sits down, smashes the keyboard with her fingers, and says ""it's not working."" and looks at me, expecting me to come over and do it without being asked. i refused to read her ""cues"" and this worked initially, eventually she asked me directly. but it doesn't work anymore. she just keeps saying things and waiting for me to do it for her.

this time i just said ""you have to use your words and ask me,"" to which she responded that she did use her words, and that i ""didn't hear her."" no, child. i did hear you. i decided to ignore you until you ask me to turn it on like someone with basic communication skills.

this isn't even the start of it. she refuses to listen to anything i teach. if i don't understand her question, if i don't answer a dumb question unrelated to the code, she'll be all ""oh, never mind"" condescendingly.

she seems totally uninterested in learning python. but when i told my manager she definitely doesn't want to be here, and her parents just want her to, she said that she does want to be here. okay, so then the problem is me? i don't get it. all the kids here like me (knock on wood) except her.

at this point she's just being rude about .... me teaching python. i'm wondering if i should just have her move to another coach bc she's outright refusing to cooperate with me and i know it can't be that i'm teaching poorly because i've had success teaching the other kids python thus far, even the ones initially struggling a lot.

i get the feeling she just did not like me since day 1. i can't tell if she just thinks she can be condescending bc i'm a woman and people literally make judgements on you based on if you're wearing a hat or not if you're female. everything you do is stupid, senseless, pointless, etc, which is how she treats most of everything i say, even if she's the wrong one. i dont even know if this is relevant or if i'll get disagreed with but i often wish i were just a guy so that i can be ""neutral"" and people have basic respect and decency, esp if i'm authority, by default.",y8o0mz,7,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/y8o0mz/how_to_deal_with_behavioral_problem_attitude/,teaching

220,I don't know where else to ask for help. I'm interested in getting a TESL/TESOL certification but I'm getting so many mixed messages about what the difference between them is.,"I am not a teacher but I have been doing volunteer one-on-one tutoring things online for a bit, and helping with homework in a kids' classroom for a few weeks.  I also went observing at this teaching English place for adults and thought I could really succeed there with the right training.

They offer a certification program, which may lead to employment, but can be used anywhere.

Apparently there are three certificates you can get as a person not really in the education system here in NYC.  They are TEFL, TESL, and TESOL.  TEFL has an emphasis on teaching in countries where English is not really spoken natively, like Japan or whatever.   TESL refers to English as a second language, in places where everybody speaks it, which would make a lot more sense for me.

And then there's TESOL, and I don't know what the fuck it actually is.   It stands for Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages.   And supposedly it combines aspects of both TEFL and TESL.  But it's also a newer certification and less trusted.  But it's also more in demand for some reason.  But it's also just ""a marketed brand"" or something according to the language center guy, and the only reason people say it more than TESL is because it's marketed well, or some shit.

The website of the language center uses ""TESOL"" in its language pretty often, and the guy tells me it's definitely a TESL certification and not TESOL.

And if this is the case, won't it be a problem when all the jobs on Indeed are referring to TESOL and not TESL?   But does it matter, even?  According to the rarely posted in TESL subreddit, nobody kind of cares whether you have TESOL OR TESL.

And then there's the wall banger of the fact that they seem to be pronounced the same.  Jesus fuck.

I feel like maybe I should run away from this place since they're pushing TESL, calling it TESOL, and promising whatever the fuck they're giving you is the best.  Or just stop whining and take the damn class, because I've been there and the students and teachers seem pretty good.

I'm getting literally dizzy thinking about this since I have to decide on paying the tuition soon.

226,How much crying is an acceptable amount of crying?,"I teach second grade. Causes of crying range from, “I just don’t understand why she doesn’t like me,” to “I’m in trouble for not doing my work,” to “I scraped my knee, I need a band aid.”

I incorporate a lot of SEL. We do two GoNoodles a day, we do movement breaks where I lead the class in stretches, or structured games. We have unstructured play time outside, twice a day, PLUS lunch. I mediate disagreements and teach the kids to use “I statements,” we re-enact situations to show what a better choice would have been. 

I’m not necessarily asking for advice, just looking for perspective; is three crying kids a week too many? (Not the same kids.)

227,Babysitting,"Warning: I’m about to ramble 

I came back to teaching sped after a couple years off (what was I thinking???). I’m at a new school with a much smaller caseload but I just feel like I’m babysitting behavior kids. 

“The teacher can’t handle him can you take him” uhhh sure let me take this non sped kid that is a behavior problem and just ignore my other students while I chase him around. Sounds great! 

More and more the teachers seem to be trying to push the problem kids into sped for longer and longer hours and the principals support it.  I’m not a behavior teacher. I don’t restrain kids, I do not want to be punched or spit on. There are other steps to take aside from “shove them in the sped corner”. 

I’m starting to hate kids, there is no solution or end to this problem in sight and I hate every single day that I walk into that school.

231,i'm resigning tomorrow,"update: about 60 seconds after emailing my resignation in, i get an email from the school about a viable gun threat. they did not cancel school today.

[i posted a couple weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/xp3gj7/i_think_its_time_to_go/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) about how i thought it was time to quit, even though i literally just started my first year teaching. i decided to wait a bit, maybe attempt to make it through the year. but there have been more developments since that post. namely, i no longer feel safe going to work. the fights have become more frequent, and i've seen very little being done about it. i see kids get in brutal fights and then end up back in my classroom the next day like nothing happened. i send kids down to the office for things that our PBIS manual indicates are ""major infractions"" (aka - they should be managed in the office)...and they just get sent back to my room.

today i had more than one student on more than one occasion allude to something strange happening in my 6th hour class (""hey are you going to 6th hour today?"" ""are you ready for 6th hour today?""). some are not even students in my 6th hour class, and when i pressed them to figure out why they were asking, they got nervous talking about it and wouldn't divulge any information. i had a class to get to so i stopped pushing, but i called the office to talk to security (which took me 3 tries btw - the office ladies rarely answer the phone). they said they would ""investigate"" but did not communicate anything with me. i had to seek a security guard out after school to find out, and supposedly he talked to them. i'm worried what might have happened if the security guard did not make if obvious to these kids that we were suspicious.

there are many more instances that have proven to me that i am not safe working at this school. i believe administration is trying their best (or maybe i'm just blind to the fact that they're not), but to me, this job is not worth the constant anxiety, sleeplessness, lack of appetite, and more. and so tomorrow i'm submitting my resignation. i'm nervous as i do not have something set up, but i truly feel unsafe where i am now. i have to leave.",y6n0q7,299,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/y6n0q7/im_resigning_tomorrow/,teaching
232,Sub threw away good supplies,"I took over my first grade class about 6 weeks into the school year. They had a teacher for a week, then she got transferred to different school. Then they had a long-term sub for 5 weeks; this lady has been subbing at the school for over a decade and is considered a ""resident sub."" Coming in, I obviously made the classroom my own by establishing systems and routines, decorating, etc etc, and it's been going really well!

I got COVID the day before Fall break and the resident sub was called into my class for the day. Today was the first day back and it seemed like she got through most everything on the plan and everything seemed pretty tidy!

We start working on our morning work and the kids don't have the crayons they need, which is super weird because I keep them stocked up and have a supply table where they can get what they need. A bunch of them pulled out brand new boxes of colored pencils that I had stashed away to use on special art projects. I collect the pencils and hand out spare crayons in the colors we need.

I ask the kids what happened to all their crayons and they said the sub collected all the broken crayons. I was like, ""ok that's weird, where did she put them?"" They told me she *threw them away*!?! I was SHOCKED, legit so flabbergasted!! 

I told them, ""ok that was a choice I don't agree with, because broken crayons still color!"" One of boys said, ""that's so true, and if you have a broken crayon now you can share with a friend!"" And I was like, ""that's the attitude I'm looking for!"" 

I am still in shock that she straight up threw away good supplies and gave out other supplies that I was clearly saving. I'm trying to work through the psychology of it, like it was some kind of power move or she felt some kind of ownership over the classroom because she was in it for so long? Either way I felt super disrespected and told the office staff I wasn't comfortable having her sub in my room anymore. They were 100% on my side and agreed that it was super weird. 

I'm pretty scrappy and save everything for supplies or art projects or scrap paper so it just completely rubbed me the wrong way. With so many schools and kids not having the supplies they need, how the hell are you gonna throw away perfectly good supplies?? It feels entitled and wasteful and I swear I'm getting over it lol

Edit: Also, I've subbed in close to 100 classes and I would never DREAM of throwing away kids' stuff unless it was legitimately gross or dangerous. Broken crayons still color!!!

233,I am a college freshman studying to be a teacher,"It has been my dream to be a teacher since 2021 in my junior year of high school. I didn't have a good relationship with my parents, but I had a teacher who really showed she cared about me and she inspired me to be a teacher. I am used to telling everyone I am majoring in Secondary-History-Education and then getting the ""You're so brave"" response. Even better- a lot of the time people go ""Oh- it takes a *very special* type of person to do that."" implying I am not one of those people. Fuck 'em.

Anyone who knew me in school knows I wasn't a very great student, which is why I think I'd be good at it. I am honest with myself- I know wanting to be a teacher is kinda a weird shitty dream, but as a student who lived through the pandemic and went through that- I'd hope I can do it.

I'm somewhat terrified because I am transgender (FTM). another reason I wanna be a teacher is to stand as a role model for queer students but fuck this news cycle of anti-trans teachers bullshit.

Our tempers were far too short, we got too snippy with students, we got lazy, etc. Every 'bad teacher' behavior you could imagine. This year I'm supporting a different teacher in the same subject, and it's so different. So much more positivity, patience, work ethic, etc. I'm happier in their class, and when I get home from work. 

It makes me really think about how much our colleagues can change everything about who we are in the classroom and how we approach our job.

241,Question for RSP teacher? (IEP),"Hi (Sorry so long),

I'm not even sure where I would post this. I'm wondering if any of you have done any accommodations for P.E.?  My son has IBS and anxiety disorder.  The IBS gets exacerbated by his anxiety.  This year he's been having more issues with it (nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea) because he's getting messed with everyday by different students.  I've talked to Admin, worked with him on sticking up for himself.  He does but says that everyday it's a different kid messing with him.  They mess with him cause he's skinny and/or cause he's black. 

Anyway, he has P.E. 1st thing in the morning & he's been having issues running because of it. They run the equivalent of a mile everyday, 3 days a week now that they're on block schedule (7th).  The teacher gives him a zero when he misses.  I don't care if he fails cause when he's able to go he doesn't do well with his symptoms & gets a 1/4 or 2/4.  I'm just wondering if there's an accommodation to add to his IEP for when he misses or a way to modify it without dropping the class altogether?  The school only changes schedules for the bad kids.  He would be there if he didn't have so much anxiety that's affecting his stomach cause of the bullying.

I just really wish these kids would go to school and behave. 

Thanks

(*not sure right flair)

SLIGHT UPDATE: 

I spoke briefly to the RSP Teacher and she is thinking we can add an amendment to the accommodations but will talk to the Vice Principal 1st once she gets the wording correct.  She also printed out the letter the doctor sent with his diagnosis to add to his file and forward to the nurse and admin.  She will get back to me.  I told her if a meeting needs to be called I will do that.

The P. E. Teacher emailed me saying that he asked my son if he wanted to make up a Timed Run at Nutrition, which was right after class, but my son refused. (My son had already ran one during the 50 minutes in class.). He said that some kids make them up during Nutrition or come in at 7am (an hour before school starts).  He also said that he doesn't have a medical note on file with restrictions or anything with his conditions.  

Mind you my son has had an IEP since 3rd or 4th grade, he's in 8th now.  I always put on his Student Data info all of his issues, I have submitted doctor's notes or medical documentation of conditions, and have a Chronic Illness Form on file with his diagnosis except this year's one only has his IBS.  Plus, the P.E. Teacher has parents fill out a form to let them know of any concerns they should be aware of.  I list them all.  If he wanted/needed a note he should have asked.  This is the same teacher who didn't realize my son was struggling in P.E. & doing worse than better.  I asked him about it when I suspected asthma.  He noticed nothing. This is his 2nd year with my son.  He knows.

Oh, & I asked my son what happened.  He said the teacher asked and he told him no, because he didn't feel good.  My son said he asked the teacher why he couldn't just do an extra lap during the Timed Run until he makes it up (i.e., 1 extra lap 4 times equals 1 Timed Run) & the teacher said no.  He just told him he's going to have to make them up at some point.

ANOTHER UPDATE: 

I spoke with the psychologist to go over options such as moving his P.E. to 6th period. I reminded her that this wouldn't solve anything if he's having issues at that time, right after lunch. And getting a doctor letter taking him out of P.E., which I don't want because there are other things they do than just run.  I am going to try to get a doctor letter with restrictions on it.  Bottom line I have to call a meeting. I am going to request one, in writing, and cc everyone on it and ask that the Special Ed Director attend.

Thank you so much to everyone that responded and helped me!  It was so good not to get berated as a parent asking for help or a bunch of downvotes or be ignored.  I really appreciate it.",y5zenm,8,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/y5zenm/question_for_rsp_teacher_iep/,teaching

244,"As a peripatetic music teacher, How much am I being ripped off?","I am 18 and working as a peripatetic piano teacher in a private music school. I'm pretty well qualified, having played piano for 10 years and reaching beyond grade 8 standard. I have also self taught 3 other instruments and have been performing consistently for the last 4 or so years until lockdown when that wasn't allowed. 

I started teaching in this private music school and I've got 9 students. I get paid £67.50 for a day of teaching and I only work one day a week. I have all but one of these students for half an hour, the one exception having a full hour. I'm therefore teaching from 12:30 to 5:30 without a break unless one of my students doesn't turn up for a lesson, although I still get paid for that students lesson because I was there and it's not my fault the student didn't show up. Doing some quick maths, for £67.50 earned over 5 hours of work, I earn £13.50 per hour, $15.15 for the Muricans and around the same for the Euro.

My parents say ""13 quid an hour is fantastic I don't see why you're complaining honestly. If I could earn 13 pound an hour I'd be rolling in it."" However, when you take into account how much the students are being charged I honestly have every right to complain. The students are being charged £24 a lesson and I'm effectively getting £6.75 of those pounds. 28 percent of the actual money. 

Am I really being ripped off or am I just having standards far too high? Should I say something? I'm really unsure because it's my first teaching job. But then I think, if I charged the exact same amount but taught these kids independently (which I absolutely could do) I'd be on £216 a week.

I’m a 20+ year HS science teacher and the majority of those years I have taught a mix of General Education and Teamed Classes (Special Education & General Education combined).  This year, I have 5 sections, 3 of which are TT. 

Earlier this week, my team teacher resigned by email 2 hours before the start of the school day.  The resignation was effective immediately and no reason was given beyond “unforeseen circumstances and personal reasons”.  Multiple people have reached out and neither admin nor I have been able to get any further information.  Paperwork has been submitted to HR.

My students are, of course, asking questions about where their teacher is, but I don’t have any answers to give them.  I have asked admin repeatedly what the plan is for communicating with both the students and the parents, but no one seems to have any answers.  In the interim, everything has fallen onto my shoulders.  

Has anyone ever experienced anything like this before? How long can admin stall before telling parents that their children’s teacher is gone? 65% of the students in my teamed classes have IEPs and are supposed to be receiving a specific number of service hours from the team teacher.

Besides stuff I mentioned in the other post we had the PSAT the other day (I thought this test had been abolished for most universities, but alright) and a training about how it would be proctored on a minimum day. I did know some of the teachers were to be designated as holding those who were late for four hours. I thought they had been informed already who that was going to be. 

I find out during the last period of the day before the test I'm going to be one but it's not explained to me how that will work. 

I did it took in about twenty five students and had them for four hours without explanation of when they would go to lunch or what I was really expected to do with them except have them do work. They didn't misbehave. 

The principal said something at the PSAT training meeting about not have enough secretaries or classified staff in the office to help and she openly said it. That's fine but I think it's jamming up communication at the school. I've personally noticed what seems like a lot of subs in the office also when I go to the restroom.

254,Not even three weeks in and I'm ready to quit,"I started a high school art position three weeks ago Monday. It's 75 miles one way for me. I accepted it because I thought it would be the only one left until next semester. I'm am currently commuting that daily. My plans has been to relocate about half way towards the school site in the next several weeks. Today made me rethink that.

I've been making this commute this entire time. There are points I get a few minutes behind and have had two situations where I'm twenty minutes late because the freeway gets shut down due to a large accident. This is very rare along this route and doesn't happen most of the time.

I know to check in and let people know I've coming in late. I checked in with the principal's secretary in the office to know what happened. They don't even know I'm the new teacher for the room, but I did it to document.

When I was hired Human Resources told me the wrong contractual hours for the school. They also didn't mention that one certain Wednesdays the day is thirty minutes longer than most others including on Columbus Day. No one at the school told me that either.

My second week into working an assistance principal I've never met comes and introduces her. She is my evaluator which is fine that is a normal process I expect as a fourth year teacher now. She has been coming in several times just to see what I need and asking me to fill out an evaluation plan. Because I was hired two months almost into the year she is doing this last minute towards the deadline. All this time I haven't had  access to attendance or email until this week or yesterday also because it's taking awhile. She has been the one arranging this.  She's nice, but I feel like excessively has been coming in because his office is down the quad.

Because I didn't have access to email I didn't know some of the details about a training being so long after normal contract hours one day and missed it. Another time I was running late and arrive during first bell because of the commute.

Yesterday I had my first department meeting and this is where I learned how visual arts is very strict about having an aligned cirriculum and doing the same projects at the same time. This is important for later. So this meeting ended at the end of the day yesterday. I don't check work email at home.

Today I had the evaluation goals meeting with her in the morning. She tells me she sent an email five minutes before the end of the day yesterday with the subject line ""concerns"" asking to meet with me and a union rep during my prep. Alright as fun as it was to get this so early.

I check the email. in first or second period. I get a call the last before before my prep to come when the bell rings.

Part of the meeting is about me missing a PD training that was thirty minutes later than normal on a Wednesday no told me has different contract hours twice a month. I had no email and went to see if my colleagues in the art department were in their rooms and weren't. No told me otherwise. She also mentioned I was late in front of her one day when the first bell rang.  It was just a discussion.

So instead of just correcting me on the contract times she set up this more formal meeting with a union rep instead. To me this is a bit strong of a response.

I learned from this meeting she was a new assistant principal to the district. The main principal has only been there two months too. I feel like I've been getting very poor communication and set up to even do this position and then this happened.

She didn't know I commuted that far yet, should have known the computer wasn't to me yet to even communicate with anyone, etc. So they are being a bit disorganized on their end.

What also came up was someone from my department asking me about having an aligned curriculum.   We literally discussed this the day before at the department meeting. The union rep I had is also my department chair too.

There was a long term sub for weeks before I took over and I am finishing a project that is usually done in about two weeks for five or six. The kids got used to that pace and then I took over and I'm planning on finishing it tomorrow.

They felt they needed to make it a point to make sure I'm talking to my colleagues and making sure I'm on the same pace. They basically want me to use a district curriculum and do the same projects at the same time as them or at least blend it to have the same vocabulary as another. This was literally mentioned the day before and I've done one project different than the pace in part because I can't control what a sub did for a month and a half and no one told her during that period to change it anyway. Why this came up at a union rep attended meeting about another topic I don't know but it did.

This meeting was just a discussion to clarify things without even a warning, but it seemed not an effective or appropriate manner to do it. Someone just getting me what I needed in a timely manner like email and a computer or telling me the different contract times would've been more useful.

This turned me off to the point I don't know if I want to continue the semester now, especially if more situations over very small things happen going ahead. I was subbing before and would have no problem just going back to that and looking for something else later on. I'm on a one year contract so I certainly don't plan to work there again next year anyway. The culture of this school is not what I expected nor do I think it's a fit for me.

I've now questioned whether I should stay and certainly relocate this close to this district. It's very rural anyway.

I'm burned out of being a teacher at all anymore and perhaps I should not have accepted this new position. The pandemic and being forced to reopen during the last quarter of one school burned me out. One of the reasons I want to move half way is so if a situation arises that is too much for me I will just walk away and resign. I'm tired of the poor management and communication in public schools, especially when it results in situations like this.

I don't know what to do. I recently applied for my multiple subject credential which I just saw today is now being processed in California. Being an elementary teacher was my backup plan.

I wrote to the district union to see what the process would be like to break contract and resign. I know they are looking for another temp teacher at one of the high schools nearby currently still.

I went in the drawers of my tech desk yesterday morning and found my missing figurine with a card apologizing. I’m sure the student doesn’t realize his handwriting is extremely distinctive, but I’m not going to pursue anything because he did return the figurine to me.

257,Is this a wrongful firing?,My sister was working for an after school program where the job is almost like being a teacher. You have to make lesson plans and even give kids homework packets. They have the kids for about 3 and a half hours. Anyways one of the rules they have for the tutors is that you can't be sitting down because they want the tutors to be able to let their presence to always be known to the kids and have less risk of incidents. My sister is pregnant and it's been a little hard on her. She has been having more back pain so she has been sitting in her classroom more often. The higher ups have been visiting her school a lot and don't like it when they catch her sitting down. They even gave her a write up and she started walking around more often even though it causes her more back pain. Later on they randomly called her and told her not to show up for work and that they were going to have a zoom meeting for her the next day. In the zoom meeting they told her that they gave her plenty of warnings about sitting down and that it's in the rulebook that she signed and agreed to that she can't be sitting down so they fired her. They never gave her an option to go get a doctor's note just told her that she should never be sitting while working (even though there are other tutors who sit while working as well). What would her next step be? She's now halfway into her second pregnancy and no longer has a job.

270,First disciplinary board as a teacher because one student dangerous behavior : I need advice to prepare and act during it. Help !," Hi everyone,

I'm having my first disciplinary as a teacher. I have a 5 years experience and I have been the head teacher for a year.

Context : my Maths colleague is having difficulties since the beginning of the lessons. She is a new and she has high expectations. My students level is really low as I work in a school with difficult students.

During the last lesson, they were doing exercises on computer, and one student (18yo, ADHD) started to get nervous with his computer (swearing, and hitting the materials). My colleague started to get stressed with him and they started to yell. Then he became angry and she asked him to leave the class, what he did. According to my students, she said something like ""anyway you are \[retarded (?)\] as you tripled your class"". He came back furious, yelled even louder and walked towards her. Thankfully, two students put themselves between my colleague and the student. She was really scared, and another colleague came to separate them and put the student outside.

My student is known to have strong anger issues, ADHD and is easily triggered. Ha had already troubles with the justice, but was never found guilty. He had softer but troubles in the past with other teachers. He has a strong influence to the other students in my class. Personally, I had a trouble last year as he wanted to fight with me. I had a strong conversation with him, and I never had any troubles since : he followed what I asked him to do, he works with me and he is a hard-worker in my class. Also he is a clever teenager.

Therefore, I pushed my direction to get a disciplinary board and he was laid off until the disciplinary board. It is my first big violent problem as a head teacher. I need advice to handle the problem, and have ideas to have a track during the board.

First, I had a ""classroom life"" with the others students, and we talked about what happened to analyse the process of the incident. At the beginning, they said : he was triggered and it was normal to react like he did. We worked to find out what was the best behavior possible, and a better behavior to have. I explained them his behavior was toxic, violent and destructive. They said my colleague pushed him to this anger. According to my students and others colleague, she is harsh with some students. Since the problem, she is definitely really shocked by the incident, and she is not far from a nervous breakdown. The atmosphere between her and my students is really bad.

\> Do you have any idea how I can cope the situation between them since the incident ?

Also I will have the disciplinary board with my director, assistant director, senior education advisor, my student, his father, student representative and me.

I was wondering what track I should follow. In your opinions, what should I think about ?

My first goal is to put my colleague in peace. Secondly, I want to ask my student to work on his anger issues. Thirdly, I want to fix the situation between my students and my colleague. I understand I can do everything, but just need a track. Any ideas ? Any values I can bring ? What will you say to him ?

Also he was a dropout student. Since he is in my school, he came every day. I want to share my concern : I am worried to lose him, and he is having this issues who could be possibly dangerous for others and for him. There is definitely a nice work to do with him.

271,Breaking Point,"I'm not sure how many people have experience in VPK (as I'm from a state that doesn't have that program and had never even heard of it until I moved to my current state). Basically, it's Pre-K (4s) with different set ups based on school. Mine happens to be an instructional ESE (special needs) teacher (me) and a CDA (an associate who manages the gen Ed students). 

Anyway, this is my first year at a new school (I was previously the CDA in the same type of class at a different school). I'm allowed to have 6 ESE students while my CDA has the remainder (14) on his/her list. I started this year with a wonderful teaching partner...who promptly left me less than 30 days in. I absolutely do not blame her. I'd be gone, too, given the chance. 

Like I said, I can have 6 on my list. I currently have 5 and 2 are pending screening. Our class list isn't full. We have 16 total. Nearly half of my students are and WILL qualify as ESE this year. And they're high needs. ASD, aggressive, 2 still in diapers and nowhere near potty trained...Did I mention I don't have a teaching partner? They've posted her job 3 times and nobody has even applied for it. I've had a revolving door of subs. Most have worked well, others...have been a warm body. 

I have IEP meetings coming up in the next 2 months. This being my first year as instructional, I've never done those before. They are terrifying. And my district hasn't offered any trainings on how to even do them.

274,A Bit of Inspiration that Hit me While Tutoring for Standarized Testing," 

One moment you are ...there...

A classroom, a library, a dusty living room

Head bent over some crisp new product of print and standardized testing

Hair brushing the tousseld locks of 

The earnest, the focused, the one who wants to learn

You just finished guiding the child through a labrynth of half remembered, half learnt rational equations

The both of you stumbled over the last one

It is time to disect some dismembered organ of text, 

Chosen, selected, disected from a living text

The child needs to use the restroom

You agree absently as you cast your eye over the text preparing to explain why the state of New York demands that the child torture this once living tale.

And then

and then

and then  you are not

The child returns and finds  you on the floor, nose nearly touching what they can still only see as print and parental requirements for all of their

earnest, focused, desire to have learned

You are to teach them

But can you? 

Can you teach them the smell of the dusty administrative offices of a Zoological Garden two centuries ago? 

Can you teach them the bemusement as you are sent by the old, wise, credulous?

Can you teach them why your heart pulsed with excitement through your skepticisim? 

Can you teach them what a fantastic beast, more mythical than a dragon, more intangible than a djin the slightly larger of a pair of black and white sea birds was? 

Can you teach them to be so gripped by a dismembered story that for a few glorious moments they too will be a cleark in Her Magisty's service leaving their dusty shelves to taste the cold salt wind of the northern islands on their lips? 

Smile weakly and hand them back that which lists the demands of the State of New York. 

Tell them to start reading, what questions to do, in a voice you swear was vibrated by a train. 

Wince as the now vital corpse is vivisected once more into, causes, tension explained, lines, half-lines.

Slowly, question, by question, you feel the twitching thing die back into grammar, phrases, words. 

Can you teach the child, you wonder, can anyone teach them so that the story can live again.",y2gpqo,0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/y2gpqo/a_bit_of_inspiration_that_hit_me_while_tutoring/,teaching
275,Pls help with elementary teacher situation,"Mom of a 10 year old here. My 5th grader has always done well academically and she loved school…until this year. She has been really stressed about her teacher who she thinks has favorites and has been unfairly harsh to her. This has resulted in her missing school due to anxiety induced physical symptoms. She just started seeing a therapist for anxiety and in the meantime, she dreads going to school because the teacher “may get mad” at her. One example she gave was that she asked for an extension on an assignment and the teacher granted it. When she turned it in, the teacher criticized her for turning it in late. DD didn’t have the nerve to remind the teacher she was granted an extension and “went out to the hallway and cried for an hour”.  Then she tells me that she has been too afraid to ask the teacher questions, and she asks the assistant instead.

While I explained to her that the teacher has many students and cannot possibly keep track of every student’s request, and that she should work on completing her assignments and not ask for extensions, I asked if I could reach out to the teacher to have a conversation about the situation. DD responded with an astounding “NO”. She doesn’t want confrontation and doesn’t want to draw attention to herself. I initially respected her wish but now things seem to have gotten worse. She is scared to go to school, which I have never seen before.  So I emailed the teacher, who replied that everything is going well and DD is doing a great job and there isn’t anything to worry about.

Surprised by this apparent disconnect, I asked for a meeting with the teacher.

I have no intention of going all mama bear on the teacher. I just wanted to hear her perspective and hopefully collaboratively come up with some ways to help DD over come her anxiety and rejection avoidance.

So for you teachers out there, what advice do you have for me to accomplish my goal? How do I get the teacher on board in understanding that my daughter has significant anxiety that is eroding her love of learning? DD has been talking to the school counselor weekly, which she finds helpful. But they have not directly addressed the issue with this teacher.

I should mention that she attends a private Montessori school and will have the same teacher for 3 years (currently in year 2 of the 9-12 class). I mentioned transferring school as an option but she says she loves her school and doesn’t want to leave. ( There are issues at her school due to new head of school making changes and teachers resisting, which led to me proposing changing schools).

I'm having many issues with grades between 1st and 5th grade. Since the schools I typically teach at just opened this year they have a major teacher shortage, they expect us to teach the kids, and make sure they stay on task. A lot of the time they don't give us enough work for the students, the work is way to simple, or they plain out don't give us anything to do with the students.

I don't have any experience here and I want to be a good substitute. Do y'all have any advice or tips of improvements I can implement?",y1as9o,21,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/y1as9o/how_to_improve_as_a_young_substitute/,teaching

A student just died in a car crash. They weren't in my class, or the same grade as any of my students, so the impact will be less, but I'm sure there's going to be some impact. Grade 8's tend to believe they're immortal, and seeing evidence of their mortality is probably going to shake even those who didn't know the deceased.

I have a cool science demonstration tomorrow (putting some metals in water and them catching fire / exploding). I have no idea if I should delay it, since it's really supposed to be about getting them more engaged, and maybe the mood is a bad match? But then, maybe something cool and fun is just what they need?

I have the same group of kids for all subjects - should we do grief type activities? Life affirming? All day, part of the day? I'm fine shunting off my plans, this is no ordinary thing, but I want to be the most respectful I can be. 

I've never had to deal with death in the classroom like this. I've had a student lose a parent or a cousin, but that'll be handled differently - more extreme grief, with only a few students. I have no idea how to handle the lesser grief (most of my kids won't have hardly met that student), that's nonetheless applicable to pretty much all of them. Maybe? Hell, their ""immortality"" might not hardly be touched, they may feel no grief, thinking it has nothing to do with them.

I am clueless, but I want to support the kids as much as I can. Please, any ideas or insights would be greatly appreciated.",y0qef4,28,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/y0qef4/a_student_in_the_school_died_and_i_dont_know_what/,teaching

290,"Going on my second year, and I’m feeling overwhelmed to the breaking point.","Hello all,

This is going to be my second year of teaching, and I just don’t know how to handle all of what is being piled onto my plate. I know this is what I signed up for, but I’m starting to feel depressed and hopeless. I’m not looking for any advice, I just want to let out what I’ve been holding in for some time.

For a little background, I started off teaching at am elementary school near the city, and I ended up having to quit mid-year right before Christmas break because I couldn’t handle teaching at that particular school anymore. I loved my kids, but I had two that needed a lot of extra supports due to special needs and behaviors that I couldn’t provide, and neither had a para to help them while I taught. I ended up getting assaulted by one of my more challenging students, and my cries for help fell on deaf ears, so I left. It was so bad there that I ended up being on a heart monitor because I was so stressed.

I’m at a better school now, but because I left halfway through, I’m behind on mandatory LETRS training, and I feel like the pressure keeps building every single day. Every week something new is piled onto our plates and no one asks “What can we do to help you?” Or asks what they can take away from us. I spend my one hour of planning during the day grading and talking to parents and lesson planning, but more often than not I’ll have to stop because we have ten other different self-directed PDs to complete by a certain deadline. Not to mention we have an entirely new curriculum, are fumbling through it at best, and are of course dealing with behaviors that have only worsened since the pandemic. I know this is common, but I feel so burnt out and alone. I try my best to create boundaries so that I don’t work at home or on weekends, but that means I’ll be at the school until five or six. 

I just feel like breaking down and crying. I feel like I can’t even give my loved ones any attention because of my job. My boyfriend lives in another state and we are both so tired we hardly have but one call a week, I haven’t seen any of my friends in months, and my cat that I’ve had for 14 years has cancer and is dying and I feel like I don’t even have the time or energy to sit with my sadness about that. I also have lost all ability to organize and be productive. My memory gets worse and worse each day and I feel like an idiot when I forget due dates and deadlines. I think I may have undiagnosed ADHD but it is taking forever to find a doctor who will actually get me the help I need, and I feel desperate.

My plate is broken. It can’t hold anything. I want nothing more than to just teach and love my kids, but inside I feel like the whole world is caving in on me. I’m trying my best every day, but sometimes my best is just getting out of bed every morning.",xzybs9,39,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/xzybs9/going_on_my_second_year_and_im_feeling/,teaching

I fell in love with the job and the kids and I chose to stay. I got hired on at the end of last year and I literally counted down the days in summer until I could see my students again.

When I returned, I was told my actual title was SESC aide rather than ICS. I was confused as I was never told of this change so I brought it up to the principal. She told me the change was made because the district took away a ICS position and moved it to SESC but she assured me I would still be providing in class support and I would barely be working with SESC. I wasn’t thrilled because I am not built for that position, but I was willing to hang on since I was promised I would be doing what I wanted. 

We are now 8 weeks into school and I am doing both jobs. I have a full load of ICS classes, with not even a minute between each, and I have been called out of those classes multiple times to provide support to SESC. I have also been pulled off of my schedule to cover teachers’ resource lessons without any plans left behind and no time to plan for myself. I feel as if I am doing way more than just my one job and it’s wearing me out. I feel I’ve been tricked and lied to so I wouldn’t leave before school started, too.

I’ve brought up my worries to the SPED lead, to the principal, and the resource teachers but I’m mostly just told to hang in there and things will get better. I just don’t foresee it getting better anymore and I’m not sure it’s worth it anymore.

I’ve been having a lot of issues with needing to constantly mask, burnout, overstimulation in the classroom, and just high ended anxiety resulting in constant dread every day I go to work. Something that’s not helping it is I do not have a supportive principle, as he sees resource/encore/electives/ect. As babysitters, and had shown through his actions that we are able to be sidelined for the benefit of the grade teachers. I great example is I am being required to teach cross-cat for free on my planning/lunch once a week. I’m also loaded all days except Wednesday’s, and the cross-cat class takes me over my max amount of classes I’m supposed to be teaching.
I’m trying so hard to hang in there because they say it gets better but I’m really struggling to feel it does. I’ve been noticing myself crying more, having meltdowns when alone, and having larger stim needs simply because it’s all just so much. I started weekly therapy and it helps a little but it’s not enough.

This is probably depressing to read. Sorry about that. I just don’t know what to do. Other than sit in silence because I was told not to complain otherwise I’d just make it worse, since they could see I have time on wednesdays and make me work a second school.",xwszwz,7,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/xwszwz/teaching_while_neurodivergent/,teaching
313,Feeling guilty about leaving my students,"Okay so I'm currently a teacher for a low-level ESL. I never had any teaching experience before this nor did I ever take a class on how to teach. I'm a senior in college and needed an internship, and teaching ESL sounded fun so I went for it. Well, I hate it and have absolutely no passion whatsoever. I'm working with my internship supervisor to quit and find a replacement, but I feel really guilty about leaving my students. They know me and are used to me, now they are expected to just get used to another teacher in the middle of the course?? I feel super bad for doing that to them. I mean I haven't quit yet, but it's a high possibility that I might so naturally I'm feeling guilty already.

315,Awesome STEAM - A community curated list of high quality STEM and STEAM resources,"As a student, I’ve spent hours browsing online for educational supplements, either because I couldn’t understand a topic from school or I wanted to learn more about a subject. While doing this, I’ve come across a few great resources, but a lot of the time I’ve found broken links, outdated information, and useless content. In fact, most of the resources I’ve found have been from my friends or teachers by word of mouth. 

To make these resources more readily available, I created Awesome STEAM, a community curated list of high quality science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM) resources. The content is completely open source, and I hope that through community contribution, we can make Awesome STEAM a go to resource to learn about anything STEAM related.

316,Make it stop,"This isn’t necessarily about the teaching part of our job, but more about appropriate workplace behavior among adults. I don’t know if I’m overreacting but I have a huge problem with the way some colleagues act surrounding pregnancy and women’s bodies. Let me start by saying I’m not pregnant, never have been, and don’t plan to. I’ve never once discussed a desire to have babies at work. 

Now that you know that, I can describe myself physically even though it shouldn’t matter. I’m a 5’ 3” female, 125 lbs, and my belly protrudes a little. Part of it is endometriosis bloating, but I do have some fat there too. One of the paras at my school has asked me not once, but twice if I was expecting. I told her no both times, and she responded by “oh, okay. Just eating good!“ not gonna lie, the second time it happened I cried in my car. The first time I was simply too stunned to react. She did come to apologize today if I was offended, but kind of made it worse by reiterating, “I just noticed your belly protruding but you must just be eating good.” I don’t want my body to be a topic of conversation at all!!!

On top of that, I’ve noticed coworkers touch the bellies of other teachers who were actually pregnant without asking. Why is this a thing? I wouldn’t want that. They’ve also said, “oh, I just thought you were gaining weight!” When pregnancies were announced.

Maybe I’m sensitive because I have a history of body dysmorphia and disordered eating runs in my family. Still, the comments seem totally uncalled for. Does anyone else notice this at school?",xvz9c7,165,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/xvz9c7/make_it_stop/,teaching
317,How do I manage attention-seeking behavior?,"I have a student (9f) who every now and then falls/trips intentionally. She'll be sitting normally and will then randomly throw herself off her chair, onto the floor with an ""ah, I fell!"" When she's walking she'll make her legs give out and fall, without anything blocking her way. Sometimes she'll seem like she's falling asleep with her head on the table and slowly slide off to the side. It's clear it's on purpose. 

I think she might not get much attention at home. When she's here she'll often tell me things about herself (like how her day went or school assignments) without me having to initiate conversation. I know she has a younger sister around the age of 2. She's told me her sister is ""the spoiled one"" and that she often looks after her. I believe her only based on the fact that she knows how to handle the baby when she gets difficult (I teach something like an extracurricular and it's open to all ages, so the baby comes here sometimes). 

Anyway, I like this student and she's very bright. I don't want to make her feel bad, I don't know if I should bring up the intentional falling when we have some time alone. Or maybe contact the person in charge of this program so they talk to her parents. I don't know if I should call on her to answer more, or praise her more. Or maybe give her a few more activities to keep her busy.

320,Pondering Grit,"Let me begin here by saying that I am a substitute teacher. However, I am also married to a full time teacher, and that my in-laws who I love very much and respect are also full time teachers. Still I am well aware of the fact that for many full timers what I do doesn’t constitute “real teaching”. If that’s how you feel then we strongly disagree but I’m not here to argue, keep scrolling. 

For those of you still here, I come to discuss a certain character trait I feel is lacking in our education system on the parts of both students and teachers. I’ve heard coaches call it “mental toughness” I’m going to call it Grit.

Students simply quit and shut down at the first signs of the unknown or anything that looks difficult like a chapter book or a particularly difficult equation. They have no mental resiliency or fight in them. The ones that do prosper.

Then I come to Reddit and go to the teachers sub, and there is a multitude of posts about “this is too hard”, “I quit today”, “should I quit?” Etc. 

Our students can read that on a teachers body language, and they can also go online and read that sub, and similar sentiments themselves. They see the adults around them quitting and praising each other for quitting. 

Students copy what is modeled for them. Somewhere as a society we lost our grit. Personally I grew up on a farm and my father was a boxer. I was taught to fight like hell for everything. Maybe dad went to far in the other direction but we have soft teachers mentoring soft kids and reality is hard. 

Yeah, the profession can have difficult days, but George Patton said “plan for the circumstances, do not wait for the circumstances to fit the plan.” And general Patton was commandeering an army not a classroom. The class room can be tough but it’s hardly a trench.

I struggle to express myself in the written word sometimes, but I think we need to toughen up and to teach toughness. Get our grit back.

321,"Not sure if this is worth consulting a lawyer for, was hired in August and still haven't started working","In a nutshell: 

- Was hired as a public school teacher in NJ on 8/19. Signed the contract and was approved by the board of education on 8/29

- Did my background check on 8/30

- Was not able to start teaching until my license transferred (I'm from a different state) and my background check came back. Thought this would take a week or so at most

- Applied for a sub certification as well on 9/2 so that, even if my teaching license took a while, I'd still be able to work in my own classroom. This still depended on background check

- I contacted the NJ Department of Education regarding both certifications. They told me that my district's HR would need to call the county education office to expedite both certs

- HR has spent weeks telling me they've gotten no results regarding my background check and haven't been able to get hold of the certification person at the county office

- I reached out to NJ's Office of Student Protection myself last week regarding my fingerprints. Turns out I was approved on 9/6. HR says ""Great, but we still can't get in touch with the cert person. We've been trying for weeks!""

- I called the cert person myself earlier this afternoon and was able to talk to her without any issues. She is going to have my sub certification completed by end of this week, while my actual license will take a bit longer. I share this news with HR, they still won't give me a timeline of when I can actually start

- I've been sitting without any sort of income for over a month and have been really financially strained by all of this. That aside, my students have had a sub for the past four weeks. You'd think HR/admin would want this resolved ASAP

For the first week or two, I figured it was just HR being incompetent, but in light of me finding out about my fingerprints being approved nearly a month ago, and being able to take care of the sub certification myself without any trouble, something just feels wrong here - in addition to all this, I have not heard a single thing from the principal. They can't fire me since the contract is signed and approved (and trust me, I've checked), but I've started wondering if they've been quietly hoping I get frustrated and quit

I'm just curious at what point something like this ceases to be ""incompetence"" and I need to consider consulting a lawyer. Any advice is appreciated

Edit: I should have pointed out that all of my communication has been with the head of HR herself, not with some random person in HR

Edit 2: Small update - HR director kept providing me with contradictory/vague responses since I posted this. I've pointed this out, she accused me of being ""disrespectful"" and won't email me any more. Still won't give me a timeline.

326,Digital writable surfaces for classrooms and auditoriums,"I work for a large university, and this seem to be a constant problem without a good solution. I'm looking for a digital writable surface, like a Wacom or the MS Surface Studio, and are wondering what good options actually exist now. Teachers want a writeable surface primarily for writing text and numbers, and simple drawing while teaching. Most classrooms have a projector/screen, and many of them are in some way connected for live streaming/recording.

We have tried just about every Wacom out there, with the ridiculously priced ergo stands, and users are generally unimpressed with them. They are also quite pricy for large scale use, about 3.700 USD for a 32 inch with the ergo stand is ALOT for a screen to write on imo.

The surface studio desktop computers are a lot more popular for our use case, and while costly (about the same as a wacom), it also comes with a solid computer. The issue with the studio - it's ancient. If they where to release a new one this is pretty much a no-brainer for us. But now with 7.gen intel, and not in production anymore it's pretty much a dead product.

I'm also very interested in cheaper solutions for smaller classrooms. With 1.000s of classrooms, a surface studio/wacom solution on all of them are not realistic.

So my questions boil down to 

\- does anyone have any solid information about a surface studio 3?

328,Oregon TSPC Question,"Hi, friends!

I am a certified teacher in the state of Oregon. My preliminary license is set to expire on 10/24 and I applied to renew it and change it to a professional license back in September. In Oregon, the first three years of your teaching career require a preliminary license and then you need to change it to a professional license. It's all semantics. 

I am not teaching this year because I am living in my husband's country of origin for the next couple months. After I applied to renew and paid the fee, the licensing agency (TSPC) tells me I need to get fingerprinted, of course. I talked to the U.S Embassy here and they said that I need to obtain an FBI card and travel to a different island to get my fingerprints done. I've gone to every civil agency in my current area and they won't finger print me. Basically, I'm screwed. 

If you teach in OR, you know that TSPC is the spawn of Satan and I haven't been able to get in contact with anyone. I've even messaged their directors on LinkedIn. I see online in many places, but not the TSPC website, that as long I file to renew within 90 days of my expiration date, I can renew my license. I will be back stateside by that window so I'm hoping I can wait until I return and complete the fingerprinting process in the US. I don't care if I have to pay a fee, do a striptease, whatever. Anything to not have my license completely expire. 

So my longwinded question is, does anyone in Oregon know if it's true I can still apply to renew my license within 90 days of the expiration date since it's next to impossible for me to get the required fingerprinting done where I am currently?

Side note, I miss my classroom so much but I can see that things are just getting tougher and more frustrating for many of you this year. I am thinking of you all and hope that you feel validated, valued, and content this year.

330,How not to overwhelm new students?,"I hope this belongs here, I did't know where else to ask. 

So, I'm a new language assistant at a language school, I just started teaching spanish a month ago. Among others, I teach a small group of 3 (beginners). So far, we've had 3 lessons: we've learned the pronunciation, greetings, introduction, some basic conjugation (of the irregular verb *ser* \- to be, the regular reflexive verb *llamarse* \- to be called, and the regular verb *vivir* \- to live). This weekend, my boss texted me saying the group would be joined by 2 new students today. Even though I've been told previously it would probably happen (boss says that's how it usually goes in her school), I had just though ""okay so it would be a good learning opportunity and I'll let my students explain the matter to the new ones"", but now I'm freaking out. I've made a little *review* sheet which I will also hand out to my ""older"" students - it contains 3 conjugation tables, some linguistic terms I'll be using often (such as *irregular,article, femenine, masculine*...), some greeting phrases and a guide of the formation of gender in spanish language (which was one of the main grammar topics of the first unit in our textbook). An extra is a dictionary website recommendation (it's an electronic dictionary that contains many words with their traduction, (audio) pronunciation, context in which the word or the word's synonym is used, etc.), because I won't be revising the entire vocabulary we've gone through (the vocabulary of the unit is basically nothing but the greetings, some professions and nationalities) and my plan is to tell them the exercises to look at and translate the vocabulary themselves also practicing the pronunciation. Problem is, while I think it's a nice review sheet for the original students and it's also everything a new student will need to catch up, I'm worried they'll be too overwhelmed by the amount of information they still need to learn. + I couldn't help but also include some new stuff  for the older students too - like a few extra greetings, some lingvistic terms, etc.

My question is: do I *make* them speak (using the sheet) or do I rather avoid calling on them? Is it safe to just let them watch what we ( the experienced students) do most of the time? Would it be too much of a waste to take time to explain everything step by step? I'm afraid it'll be a waste of time for the experienced students while it'll be too much information for the new ones so they end up forgetting everything straight away.

My doctor thinks I have schizoaffective disorder but I’ve been doing reading on schizophrenia and I relate pretty hard to everything I’ve read. I feel like I am a born educator. I’m good at what I do. But I had to take a sick day a couple weeks ago due to paranoia and hallucinations I was having that morning. I went to the doctor instead. 

I have an appointment with a psychiatrist in a month so I’ll have to take some time off for that too. 

I feel like my psychotic symptoms are getting worse over time despite medication, which I take every day. I don’t want to say I can’t teach if I’m on the schizophrenia spectrum because that’s ableist. But I can’t be schizophrenic if I’m a teacher. Meaning I have to keep my wits about me at all times and I dissociate during lectures all the time. 

It’s just not fair. I’m trying to get an educational YouTube channel off the ground so if that works out I think that could work for me so I can work on my own terms at my own pace. I feel like I belong in education, but schools make me feel trapped and paranoid. It’s not fair.

333,(neurodivergent) paraprofessional here. Having issues with one of the teachers I work with. Advice?,"I posted this in another subreddit, but I made the mistake of posting it at a weird hour, so I didn't get too many replies. I didn't want to spam that subreddit, so I thought I would post here. I have edited it a little for clarity.


I'm sorry this is so long. I just wanted to provide as much context as possible.

TL; Dr: One of the classroom teachers has been hostile towards me and reprimanded me harshly in front of the class. I don't know if I should escalate my concerns, or if disclosing my disability could be helpful)

So, I am a paraprofessional for learning support in an elementary school (I technically have Ele and Spec. Ed. certification, but due to my disability I've chosen a less stressful route). I am also neurodivergent. I have documented OCD, and take medication for attention. I also almost certainly have autism, but you know how girls in particular fell through the identification cracks in the 90's (and still do, honestly). It is worth noting that I have explained the autism to *some* staff that I trust, like the learning support teachers.

I know that I can miss nonverbal communication and might say/do things that are interpreted differently from my intent. *I'm totally ok with others mentioning this to me in private so I can self-correct.* Though this hasn't been much of an issue, and in general the teachers are friendly.

However, there is one teacher that I work with that I am very uncomfortable with. Sometimes she will be very complimentary For example, she said that because of my educational background, she trusted me to have control of what I do with the students I work with.

Other times she comes off as passive aggressive. Toward the end of last year, she started asking me ""can I help you"" at what felt like odd times. Like, I could be just walking through the door to the classroom. This *might* be just a nonverbal miscommunication, but it only started the last few weeks of school.

 At times she has come across as hostile. For example, once when the kids were going on a trip, I asked one of my kids if he packed lunch. He said yes, but his bag only had a snack and drink in it. I said to his teacher, ""I'm guessing he's also getting the school lunch"" to just double check, and she got very defensive for some reason, saying that she knows what's going on with her kids. (On my last post, someone pointed out how my phrasing was poor. So, this example isn't necessarily a good one).

Another time, the emotional support teacher asked me to accompany a student with autism through the lunch line, as he has a habit of touching/smelling food and then changing his mind. I reminded him that we don't touch food until we are *sure* we want it. He ended up getting upset when he was not allowed to pick something different. The cafeteria staff and I were able to convince him to move along. When he got to checkout, this teacher happened to be there. He told her I wouldn't let him get celery. She asked me ""why I was denying him celery."" I attempted to explain that he had already picked something else, and I was explicitly told to not allow this. She said she was aware of the issue and took him back to get what he wanted. It was a strange situation. It kind of felt like she was undermining the emotional support teacher, especially since she *knew* this was an issue.

I've had other issues before with this teacher, and asked for help from the learning support teachers. I often feel disoriented in her classroom. One of them shared that he hated being in her classroom, and that it was ""chaos."" He also said that this teacher was treating me more like an assistant than an aid (I worked with all the second grade classes and a fourth grade class. I was not a 1:1 or in her class the majority of the day, but she wanted me to keep track of what projects had and hadn't been completed and whether or not their homework logs were filled out, which just wasn't possible for me to always be able to do).

The thing that bothers me the most is when she raises her voice at me in front of the class. The other day, she was addressing the class. I was talking to a student I work with, in what I thought was a quiet voice. The teacher stopped and looked at me, saying that she was talking to the class. ( I wish I could remember exact wording, but I was kind of in panic mode. It was quite stern, and I almost cried)

Then, she was reprimanding the class in the same breath, saying they were rude for interrupting her, and that she had an activity planned, but the ""moment was ruined.""

Like...I understand the frustration, but the way she worded it and the juxtaposition of reprimanding the students at the same time felt...Very demeaning. If she had said something like ""Ms. Blind wisdom, could you pause your conversation so that the whole class can hear what I'm saying,"" that would be totally fine.

I am wondering if disclosing my disability (so she knows I'm not intentionally being rude or questioning her) would help, or if it might just make things worse. 

I want to also reiterate that she is the *only* teacher I've had issues with here. Other staff have agreed with me that her expectations have at times been unreasonable. Even the *custodians* have an issue with this teacher.

I had asked to not be placed in her class this year, but we are short staffed, so...Yeah. I have told my supervisor (learning support teacher), but I don't think she's been able to do much. I don't know if I should escalate and bring it up to the special education coordinator or not.

I really don't want to escalate, but at this point for the sake of my mental health, I need to do *something.*

334,any advice on how to quit?,"i teach in florida and have been growing unhappy with the profession for about a year now. things have been getting progressively worse in terms of responsibilities being thrown at us and our district refusing to engage in negotiations with the union over salary and other things. i’ve also developed ulcerative colitis (sorry if tmi) that seems to be related partly to the general unhappiness i’ve been experiencing.

i think hurricane ian has been my breaking point; while it didn’t hit my county too hard, being away from work (our district closed to use schools for shelters) has made me realize a lot and i just don’t want to be a teacher anymore.

anyone have experience with leaving early in a school year like this? how did you do it? do i let them know i’m looking around or should i just put in my two weeks when i find something new? i’ve already made up my mind after thinking about it for almost a year, so any advice on how to rip the bandaid off would be helpful.",xsyz63,108,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/xsyz63/any_advice_on_how_to_quit/,teaching
335,New para who keeps getting pulled to sub,"Hey guys, I just need a quick vent after my awful day. I’m a new supervisory para at a middle school, and that has been pretty okay the last month or so. Lunches are chaotic for sure, but expected. I also supervise several small “study hall”-like classes with kids who are falling behind. I basically just make sure they are actually working instead of playing games and goofing off like they would in a regular study hall. That has also been okay, but I often feel like the kids think I’m a teacher who can help them with their work, but I don’t get paid to do that lol. Obviously I help them where I can, but I don’t have the tools to explain certain concepts to middle schoolers “what do you mean by the variable I manipulate???” 

Anyways, I have been pulled several times to go sub for teachers, oftentimes with no sub plans. It is the single most stressful part of this job so far, especially since my questions about a sub differential has been dodged several times. Today I subbed in a homeroom and the kids were so sweet, they just quietly read or worked on assignments and were generally very well behaved. Then at the very end of the day I had to sub another class and I was still riding the high of that homeroom, only to be immediately smacked down from it. 

As soon as I walk in I see 4 of my most awfully-behaved kids from lunch. One of them being a kid who is also in my controlled study hall, arguably the laziest and rudest kid I’ve ever met (needs to be spoon fed every single step of a direction.) They’re all already trying to swap seats despite me having the seating chart right in front of my face. They’re ignoring all directions, and I have to leave all of the well behaved students hanging because I’m trying to wrangle these other kids. 

Then, I have a girl walk in and sit on a table in the back?? I also recognize her from lunch as a not so well behaved kid who often hangs with kids who are trying to hide in the lunchroom because they’re cutting class. So I asked her “hey, you’re not on my roster, are you supposed to be in here?” I’m immediately met with a bad attitude and “I’m a volunteer.” “In a classroom?” (The student volunteers are usually working in the offices.) she is very dismissive about it and won’t give me anymore information than “I’m a volunteer.” She’s not in my sub packet at all, so I call the office and someone comes down to explain to her why she can’t be in there today because there’s a sub, etc., 

Meanwhile I have those 4 boys continuing to be disruptive and foolish, but at least the other kids are working on their stuff I guess? Can’t win em all. But then the little ringleader grabs another kids stuff and won’t give it back, he’s running around, being a distraction. So I tell him to go to the office, my patience for him is gone. He sits in his chair and keeps saying “bro I didn’t even do nothing bro” so again I have to have someone come down and get him. 
His friends are immediately salty “if you’re ever my sub again I’m skipping,” etc., Which like, god please do not show up the next time I have to sub, I would love that. 

The period finally ends and I’m just left empty. The last few classes I’ve subbed for have been so sweet. I often end up in the same one because their teacher coaches a sport, and I always help them with their assignments, and even the one or two kids in there who are wild during lunch seem happy to see me. The classic flattery of a middle schooler when they have an easy day because of a sub “can’t YOU always be our teacher???” I gotta admit it’s warm and fuzzy to hear and it’s nice when they appreciate your help. And then this class today was just a slap back to the reality of dealing with middle schoolers I guess.

I know you guys deal with classes like this every day and damn, do I salute you. It’s not even MY own class I’m trying to help with, and it’s so demoralizing to have it go so off track and then to have to be “the mean teacher.” Thanks for listening yall.

342,Being Moved to Teach Special Ed Class in Middle of the Year,"I was the team lead of an entirely new team because all the old teachers left. Red flag, right? This year, a new teacher on the team has targeted my leadership by  arguing every decision I make to the point I realized that it wasn’t genuine inquiry but combativeness. 

This teacher has also lied about me to the principal. Lying about things that the other team members can attest to not being true because they were there and they have explained this to the principal as well. 

Then this teacher admitted to recording our planning meetings and this was clearly without our consent. When I submitted my statement about what was going on, the principal was more concerned about my word choice in suggesting this teacher felt inadequate and that’s why they lie and argue, than the lying and spying in the first place. Another Red Flag. 

So I took a day off to deal with the stress of it all. It happen to be our open house, so he’s mad he had to scramble to put a presentation together. But if I wasn’t dealing with the stress of this team member, then I would have been able to handle it. 

Today, I get called to his office and he told me I was going to teach 8 grade spec Ed. I have a week left with my students who have been pretty cool this year.

However, I realise there are other things that may not be important but this information may be needed later, e.g. signing a student out of class because she's unwell, absent students because they are seeing another teacher etc. 

So my question is, do you have a classroom notebook and what do you jot down in it? I will get started first and list some things that I may want to try to jot down during lesson or immediately after the lesson ends: 

1. Lesson progress 
2. Attendance and student movement
3. Student management matters (usage of mobile phones, forgetting to bring notes, interpersonal matters etc) 
4. Personal matters that the student brings up that doesn't affect the lesson but may require follow up (family issues, injuries etc)

now i know what you’re thinking. it’s only been a month they’ll calm down or my first year of teaching was really tough too, it’ll get better. you’re probably right! it will get better!

more importantly is that i am drowning. i feel like 95% of my job is damage control - making sure my kids don’t kill each other in class, and then documenting everything outside of class so their parents don’t get angry with me. 

i can’t sleep - i am constantly having nightmares about work. i can’t eat. my hair is literally falling out from the stress. i regularly get headaches now. i don’t think any job, even one i’ve been looking forward to for years, is worth that.

i’ve explained how i’m feeling to other teachers and asked “does this go away?” and they kinda just laugh and say “not really”.

I asked them to show me their actual level now. I had them all log in and start their first auto-leveled assignment.

362,Teaching Career Advice," This school year, I was ushered in as an emergency hire for a moderate-severe special education classroom at a middle school in Hawaii. I have my B.A. and just found out yesterday that I got into the program at the State school to get teaching certified. This program is paid for by the government through stipends, so I practically receive this degree for free. Instead of student teaching, I also am just able to keep teaching in my classroom as the fieldwork requirement and I will be certified within 18 months.

I did not think I was going to enjoy this position very much, but it has truly been a great experience. I catch a bit of sass from my department head every once in a while and some parents are absolutely insane, but I really enjoy my students and working with professionals in the classroom such as the RBTs, EAs, SLP, OT, BCBA, etc....

SPED teachers in Hawaii as well make about +10k compared to gen ed teachers annually so there are simply many pros to continuing my career as a special education teacher.

Still, since I merely found myself in this position with not much thought about it right after college graduation, I cannot help, but feel that I am not making the correct choice in continuing teaching.

What would make me happy in life is getting my MS OR MA in Economics and then becoming a data analyst or even a professor.

I work about 10 hour days throughout the week (2 jobs because of low teacher salary) and by the time I get home I am exhausted so it is really difficult for me to brainstorm this momentous decision. In short, 

teaching = Fun class environment, low stress for now, good pay in the future, job security, good holidays, great coworkers.

Economics MA= Leap of faith, struggling on low salary for the next 2 years with a grad assistantship probably, intellectually provoking , I have to wait until 2023 to begin, I have to deny the state school program which is very convenient in getting teaching certified.

373,Unenthusiastic Kids Ruin It for the Bunch,"For context: This is my first time working in a school setting and it had not been the best for me. The job I am doing is not the one I originally applied to and I was not informed that I would not be doing the job I applied for until I started actually working at my site. 

Uh yeah this is going to be long. It’s been a good two months and I am still struggling effectively do my job. There are many factors as to why- lack of resources mainly, but a HUGE issue is that I have these 4 students that refuse to participate. 

All 4 of these students come from the same household and carry the same attitude towards school. They are horrible to their teachers (including me) and just genuinely do not care to participate in any activities other than eating the snacks their provided. The issue being that my job is to come up with activities for the students. Often times this is group activities seeing as most of the students enjoy it. But since these students do not participate it makes things a lot harder.

Usually I just allow them to sit out since they’ll just sit down during a game and doing nothing anyway I would rather them do it somewhere that they are less likely to be trampled. Also there have been times where I had to stop other kids from starting conflict over them, “dragging the rest of us down.” But my manager says that I have to include them in activities whether they want to are not because participation is required in order to stay in the program. Recently what has been happening is I’ll have to basically force them to participate, they become agitated then I have to stop the entire activity and talk to them. Or even worse- other students will see them misbehaving and will do the same thing. I have already had an incident where one student has gotten hurt because of this as well. 
 
I have tried so many ways to try and give them a reason to participate. Candy, prizes, I even went as far as to ask them what activities they would like to do- all to no avail. It has made other kids feel like those 4 get special treatment (which in all honesty they kind of do) 

I have spoken to my site supervisor about them before because lack of participation is NOT their only issue. We have spoken to their parents as well and their attitudes have not changed. I honestly only believe that they’re still in the program because my supervisor knows their parents well because other students have been told they would be kicked out for a lot less- I mean seriously a lot. And we have a waiting list full of other kids that want to be here, that want to learn, and will respect the rules of the program.

Edit: I read my own post and realized that I talked so much that I didn’t get my point across lol. What I was venting about with this post was the fact that it’s unfair to all parties (me as a teacher, the 4 kids who do not want to participate, the other 40 or so kids, and kids who cannot join because we are at capacity) that kids who do not want to be there are forced to show up and are expected do things they do not want to or they get in trouble.

382,Tips for chatter boxes & stopping early,"For context, I teach high school US History in classes with mostly 10th graders.  Its my fourth year teaching, but first year in high school.  Last three were in middle school.

Overall, my students are great and compliant.  However, particularly in my last class (6th period), I've noticed kids have stopped working earlier and earlier.  I've practiced the policy that I'll notify them 4-5 minutes before the end of class.  This way no kid feels rushed to make it to the bus and everyone has the opportunity to socialize before the end of the day.  But as I said, kids are starting to stop working 10-15 minutes and packing up around 10 minutes before being directed to do so.  As a result, unfocused chatter, work not being done, etc. has increased.

And so far in my career, I've found idle students tend to lead to misbehaviors.  So I do strive to make sure there's plenty of work without being unrealistic of the volume of it.  And typically I would ignore or personally redirect one or two kids, but this is growing to 8-12 kids in a room of 31.

Should I rethink letting them get ready 5 minutes early?  Should I add more time to my mini-lessons so that there's less work time with hopes they'll use that time better?

383,Teachers of Tomorrow - how can I do my best?,"I’ve worked in a lot of different kinds of educational environments as a paraprofessional, preschool assistant, substitute for high school and alternative schools.

I recently starting subbing at a new school and the principal was really impressed that I had my BA and encouraged me to get my teaching certificate. He told me that many people in my situation go through an alternate route and recommended Teachers of Tomorrow as it’s a low fee program in Michigan. 

I called them right away because it seems a bit too good to be true. I’ll have 93 hours of online instruction in classroom management, lesson planning, etc., take the subject area state tests, and do CPR training and then I’ll have my interim teaching certificate. At that point I can be hired as a full time teacher in my own classroom. No observation hours required prior, just some observation check ins over the next 3 years. 

It was recommended to me by a local principal who wants to hire me, so obviously I applied. Its not like I have zero experience but I do feel scared about the lack of support here that a post-bacc and student teaching would offer in a traditional program.

I currently work customer service part time and sub. I want to get out of crappy customer service jobs and have always had a passion for teaching. I’m going to start subbing full time to get the most experience I can and know what grades and schools I like best.

393,"I’m a new para, no experience, and my teacher is acting weird toward me","Context: 


It’s my third week as a high school paraprofessional in a classroom with students with autism and downs. 
I have no experience in this setting, but I’m passionate about helping others and teaching/guiding students since I know school was tough for me too. I have fresh experience being in school (I graduated HS in 2020) so I can give insight to students struggling, that I went through the same thing. I’m 20f, and the students love me, I think because I’m more “relatable” rather than someone 3x their age being their para. The gen ed teachers really like me too, we have great conversations and they always tell me how thankful they are that I’m here. 


HOWEVER, my actual teacher (and her right hand para) are very cold, annoyed, and condescending toward me. It seems like they’re expecting me to have the same experience as said para who has been one for 30+ years. They get annoyed when I don’t know something. Things that are not dangerous to not know, rest assured- just things like random quirks of students. For example, I learned “don’t wear sandals because there’s a student who will try to take off your shoes” BY wearing sandals one day and that exact thing happening to me. Teacher got annoyed I didn’t know… I think she should have told me on my first day of these different student quirks. Also things like not knowing that I have to come in early and print things for her. 


I accept teaching/guidance with open arms and a smile. I fix any problems immediately. And yet I’m just met with more rolled eyes when I enter a room, and exasperated signs when I ask a question. 
I had to sit down with a sub para to ask basic work questions because I was too nervous to ask the main one. 
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong… I’m the only para that’s being treated like this, so I know it’s not stress- or else they would be snapping at everyone, not just me.

396,"Complained about co-teacher, now feeling super anxious it was unprofessional or inaccurate!","So, long story short, this year my co-teacher (HS ELA) got a new job just as the year was starting and they moved a colleague from advisory into the position. We're meant to work extremely closely (same assessments, splitting lesson time in the same room, able to swap perfectly with each other) which is... fine, except my new co-teacher has never taught a content course at our school and doesn't know the curriculum. It's been a hard few weeks having to defend every decision and explain every nuance to her, while she declines to let me take the lead in the partnership. Doesn't help that she is (by her own admission) totally overwhelmed and not very tech literate, and needs a lot of support from me.

This morning I had a little private meltdown when something (not her fault!) went wrong, and decided that at my already scheduled supervisor meeting I was going to put in notice. Lots of problems at the school, nightmare for so many reasons, and this co-teacher is the encyclopedia set that broke the camel's back. I have been looking for a new job since August and have ""big quitting feels"" at least a couple times a week.

Big surprise though, when I got in the room I chickened out and instead told him that the partnership is unsustainable and heavily implied that if there isn't some sort of intervention (providing her support that's not me, altering the co-teaching standards to be less close, providing co-teacher training encouraging junior teacher to follow senior, etc) that I will quit during the academic year.

Then, of course, our afternoon class went great. I mean, great by my very low standards with her, but it was effective and she said hardly anything inaccurate! And now I'm feeling like it's fine, I can totally deal with this, why was I making a big deal? Regretting bringing it up to my supervisor and by extension administration, who WILL be talking about it and I think probably addressing it. They can't afford to lose an ELA teacher right now.

How unprofessional was this? Should I be feeling like big crap right now? Should I be afraid of what my admin will be doing? Fwiw I think I'm a middling employee for the two years I've been at this school, for a few reasons. No excuses, just true.

&#x200B;

EDIT: So today, the day after I posted this, my supervisor AND my co-teacher's supervisor just be-bopped in to our class unannounced, observed for half an hour, left, and did not follow up at all! Like they were never even there :,D

FURTHER EDIT: So about ten days later we had a TERRIBLE day and I was fielding calls from parents about her behavior in the classroom. It was appalling, she was so overwhelmed that she was unkind to several students, and as usual said inaccurate things that freaked some students out, thinking they were completing our current essay incorrectly; I didn't witness most of this but it all made sense. Went back to my supervisor to follow up, are any changes being made? Heard no, so I said I'm going to write the principal now to put in notice. I try, and principal and VP counter with an offer to dissolve the coteaching relationship and basically impose a restraining order against her, and also offered several other working condition changes. The principal expressed regret setting the two of us up in the first place, and says basically they were all just waiting for me to lose it. Having learned (between talking to my supervisor and talking to the principal) that another ELA teacher is about to start a 12-week leave I accepted the offer and am staying. I really hope I don't regret it!

397,Principal disparaging my team to district level people,"Our district coach told us that he had spoken to the district director of our division (we're early childhood in a building of mostly elementary) and told her that we were all racists and had hounded away a new hire of his.

Whole Story:

There are three early childhood classes in the school, each with a teacher and an aide. Last year two of us were white, and one was black (two of the aides are white, one is black). We all were initially coming back this year, but our black coworker decided within weeks of school starting not to return because she got an amazing grant to use towards getting her PhD and ADMIN REFUSED to accommodate her twice monthly absences in order to fulfill some of the parameters of the grant. I include this because yes, our group is nearly all white, but it's the admin's fault that they failed to retain an amazing black teacher.

Admin then hires a new teacher, who is from Africa. We all meet her briefly at the school's Meet the Teacher event, but as we were all super busy we didn't get to talk to anyone besides parents that night. She comes to me at the end of the evening and mentions our district coach said I made a digital resource that might be helpful, and I agree to send it to her first thing in the morning. My total face time with her was probably about 5 minutes total. Next day I send her the file, as promised. New Teacher isn't even in the building, as her actual start date isn't until two days after school starts, as she needs to finish her background check/etc and finish submitting paperwork for her license (she was an older woman, but a brand new graduate).

The aide assigned to New Teacher's room comes to me and the other teacher and is concerned because New Teacher had asked her the night before if she(the aide) was the teacher and seemed surprised when the aide said that New Teacher was the teacher. Earlier that week another teacher in the building had been through a confusing onboarding process and had been completely surprised when she got to school and her assignment was not at all what she had believed she was interviewed/hired for.

During a scheduled meeting with admin the aide (who is black) brought up this statement and we shared concerns around this. The Principal assured us she knew her role and we thought that was it.

That was on Friday. By Sunday evening our district coach shared with us that New Teacher had withdrawn due to a family emergency in Africa and had to leave the country.

But apparently, according to our principal, we hounded her out of the job with our racism.",xjqda8,43,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/xjqda8/principal_disparaging_my_team_to_district_level/,teaching

Hey guys! Just need some advice, long story short I am a college student studying to get my degree in early child/childhood education but now I’m conflicted. With the teacher shortages, school shootings, challenging behaviors and low pay I just don’t know if I want to even pursue teaching. My dream was to teach either kinder or 1st but when I look at jobs on indeed the pay is so low, which doesn’t help because I live in NY. I currently work at a daycare and I love it most days, some days I want to walk out and quit lol, but the kids I can’t get enough of.

406,Any other HS science teachers feel like most of the science we teach is useless?,"So much of what we waste time teaching is pointless information and not applicable to life. Sure, maybe it’s useful for preparing for taking science in college, but so much of it will never be used.

I strongly feel we have to start focusing on big picture ideas, and the central focus should be on our environmental crises. Students need to be leaving high school aware of what is happening in the world, and not just “prepared for college science classes”. 

Students across the country are learning very little about:
* climate systems and climate change
* pollution and pollution chemistry
* energy systems (carbon and non-carbon)
* weather
* biodiversity
* causes of biodiversity loss
* conservation
* food systems and agriculture
* plants and soils
* gardening and farming practices
* land use and urbanization
* nutrition
* ecology (beyond the basic elementary crap like food webs)
* pathogens and epidemiology

Instead they are learning pointless info about how protein synthesis in a ribosome, or how a ball rolls down a fucking imaginary hill. Who gives a shut if the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell if you don’t know why it matters in an ecosystem? Does it matter if a kid understands a balanced reaction versus them understanding that chlorofluorocarbons deteriorate ozone or burning fossil fuels emit carbon dioxide? Is it really important that a kid knows the steps of mitosis? 

I could go on, but I think I made my point clear.

TLDR: most of what we teach in HS science is pointless and should be replaced with applicable topics that relate to our current environmental problems.",xi3cu9,68,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/xi3cu9/any_other_hs_science_teachers_feel_like_most_of/,teaching

410,Standards Based Grading Amalgamation?,"I teach high school in AZ, so this is coming from the viewpoint of the absolute worst state in the US when it comes to education.

My district has recently come up with this amalgamation of Standards Based Grading mixed with 20% free points for simply doing homework and participation. Sure, I'll do whatever they tell me to do?  My issue is that the students are allowed to turn in ANYTHING up to 2 weeks late without any penalty at all. Not just 2 weeks late but 2 weeks from when I graded the material. Oh, and if they bombed a test/quiz they can retake it without any penalty as well. Again, two weeks from when I provided feedback.

I'm a reasonable person. I get that they want to make sure teachers aren't grade bombing kids with no opportunities for improvement. My biggest issue just happened 8 weeks into the school year. The administration just sent out information that practice work/homework cannot be marked down when turned in late. However, many of us were operating under the assumption that this work could not be submitted late for credit. Now, I have to go back and retroactively fix all my grades. I love how the people making triple my salary can't get their policies and procedures done until we're nearly a quarter of the year in. I'm also a huge fan of moving the goalposts after the game has already started.

Is anyone else dealing with these ridiculous policies intended to make it next to impossible for a student to fail? The lowest a student can get on any submitted work is 50% and 40% for any missing work. It is mathematically almost impossible to fail by just giving even a modicum of effort. We have set the bar so low that I just feel like an underpaid babysitter that really loves to ramble about science.",xhx5h0,16,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/xhx5h0/standards_based_grading_amalgamation/,teaching

But when she has to do the work on her own accord she just gets lost again and shuts down. I helped her set up a realistic work planning, i gave her some studying techniques, and i help her anytime the material is too tough.

I should add that she has some mental things, slight autism, depression and dyslexia, so she is not handed an easy card. But she is smart, she does learn quickly.

423,Classroom Management Advice --First Grade,"Hey all,

This is my second year and I'm feeling like I've lost my mojo.

I went from 17-19 (it fluctuated) kids last year to 20 this year but it feels like I've gained 5 kids and not just one!

20 is still a super small class size! Yet I still find that I'm struggling with my whole group lessons and transitions. Can you help me brainstorm some ways I can increase engagement and control the situation more when I'm giving a lesson and transitioning? We've been in school 2 weeks.

I'm feeling pretty terrible and have even gotten impatient and snappy with my kids at times. I feel like the world's biggest witch. I want to be a NICE teacher, and I know the reason why I feel like such an ogre is because I'm getting flustered and frustrated.

\- I use a whole class behavior management system with Class Dojo. I give positive points ONLY! I give them out for transitions and following instructions quickly!

\- We do a lot of ""beat the timer"" games when it's time to clean up or transition to another activity. Class Dojo has a great timer feature!

\- We do lots of brain breaks. Some are educational (alphabet exercise) and some are just for fun (Go Noodle). Some are energetic and upbeat and some are calming and mindful (meditation or gentle yoga).

\- I did 4 days of story books about expected school behavior. Decibella was a new one to me and I really thought it would help....I even custom made these visual supports for each voice volume level and have tap lights next to each one to show the kids the expected volume level. We've re-practiced the voice volumes several times. (They just are so fucking loud haha)

That covers the main aspect of my whole group behavior management. Here's my issues:

\- They are in group desks. I moved from groups of 6 to groups of 3 and am considering just putting them back in rows like in COVID.

\- I have a major behavior kid in my class with suspected ODD who derails the learning and terrorizes the class about 75% of the time.

\- I have about 4 kids who struggle the most with off-task behavior and talking, but I have another handful who are very sweet and try hard but are just HELPLESS. Transitions take FOREVER because half the kids move like molasses and don't seem to understand the concept of picking up garbage or putting away pencils and then another handful who use it as an excuse to engage in playtime.

\- I feel like I'm spinning my wheels all day long just to keep my class at a manageable level. It's the end of the second week and I feel like we haven't accomplished ANYTHING.

\- My direct instruction is very frustrating. I've got the behavior kid, 1/3 of the class engaged, and another 1/3 that either aren't listening and off with the fairies or are just actively distracting others. It gets to the point where I start to bitch at them in the same tone that I bitch at my own children with. I don't like being a bitchy grouchy teacher. I'm just so FRUSTRATED.

439,Treating high school students like they’re college students?,"Hi, all. Let me first preface this by saying I’m a complete outsider to the world of teaching, and this is really just a hypothetical question that’s been on my mind. Is it at all reasonable or effective to teach high school students like they’re college students? 

I know it’s a strange question, but what I mean by this is college/university instructors will really put the burden and responsibility of things on the students rather than themselves. Instructors never force you to do your readings and assignments or even attend class, if you really don’t want to. But if you fail the class and don’t earn the credits for it, effectively wasting your money, that’s on you. Are high schools teachers able to have that same teaching philosophy, or are they obligated to make the students learn, even if they’re not at all interested?

At what point can you shift the burden and responsibility from “I’m a bad teacher, because I can’t get these kids to learn no matter how hard I try” to “The kids who want to learn and pass the class will do so, and the kids who don’t want to will fail”? Or will school administrators reprimand you for thinking that way? Is this much easier said than done? At the end of the day, there’s only so much you can do, and if there are students who want to be obnoxious and not give a damn about their classes, well I guess they’re going to have a tough time graduating.",xeqnru,24,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/xeqnru/treating_high_school_students_like_theyre_college/,teaching

I recently switched my major to English, and I'm contemplating between a minor or master in education. I've seen teachers have only one or the other, or both. I want to teach middle school or high school English

My question is which one is better? Would a master's degree open more job opportunities for me? Should I get a minor before pursuing a master? I also go to school in Nevada (not the best for education I know) so would a master's degree be better if I taught in different states?

448,Leaving the profession and therefore also this subreddit,"I want to thank everyone who has advised me and shared their own honest teaching ups and downs. When I was student teaching in college I hated the first school I was placed at but loved the last two, and when I started my first teaching job last year I hoped I’d love it too, but I did not. I myself have been and have seen coworkers being insulted and verbally abused by students who continuously get away with too much shit. I’ve seen the school install permanent security guards because the conflicts between some students were getting out of hand. I’ve seen locks being changed because students were vandalizing stuff around school. I’ve seen parents and admins who constantly downplay these things or refuse to acknowledge them. I am done. As soon as I started I knew I wanted to get the hell out of there. I don’t know how I managed to finish the school year but I did, and after it I immediately resigned. This school was recommended to me my one of my professors who taught there up until a few years ago, and it was nothing like he described. The entire year I felt like I was being thrown to the wolves and I contemplated quitting mid year a thousand times. I even started secretly hoping that the pandemic would flare up so that we would go back to online teaching and I wouldn’t have to physically go anymore. And of course I’ve had several students who were so kind, who did their best and treated me nicely. I’ve also had some really nice coworkers. But the negative aspects took such a toll mentally that I’m too scared to ever try this again, even at a different school in a different area. I’ve learned I’m too sensitive, too thin-skinned and too insecure for this line of work. I’ve started grad school to pursue a master’s degree that is within my subject but has nothing to do with education so that I might find a new career. Maybe some day I’ll teach at college level which I’d like, but no more middle and high school. Any enthousiasm I had for that is gone for now, I’m too scared the next school will also be a disappointment.

I am trying to keep it light and fun as they learn but I feel like I am losing majority of students after some time. I have tried playing a game in between to give them a bit of break but they have been bit too loud and other teachers have complained about it.

Also some kids are more advanced (so that more knowledgeable on this) and some kids are starting out fresh (from basics). How do I keep them all moving together?

I'm from Maryland, and have been in Germany for grad school the last few years. Currently a PhD student in American literature, but not planning to stay at the university level. It's possible that my (German) partner and I move back to the U.S. in a few years, to teach high school. I'd especially want to teach English, or U.S. History; she'd especially want to teach French, German, or ESL.

I'll have one year of long-term substituting experience in Maryland, a BA in English (from a U.S. uni), an MA/PhD in American studies (from a German uni), and university teaching experience. I also speak Spanish, and taught ESL (not certified) in Peru for three months.

My partner is German and is a certified German/French/English teacher, with MA-level degree in education, and will have had \~5 years' experience teaching. She's also taught in NZ and France, and was a Fulbright German teaching assistant for a year in the U.S. She's a near-native English speaker.

I'm wondering what our options might be for high school teaching jobs. We would ideally like to move to a city in the North East (somewhere from DC – Boston) or California, where my family lives. We'd be willing to teach at private or prep schools, though ideally--at least eventually--would get public school jobs.

468,First Year in New District - Heck of a Schedule,"Hello All,

I'm pretty new to Reddit as a whole, more so to this subreddit, but I wanted to see if I could get some help with figuring out how to make this new schedule I got work a little more smoothly.

**Context** \- The district that I came from had me running English co-taught 11/12 mostly, with a rotating random section of English 10, College Comp, Wellness Seminar, etc. on a cycle of eight daily 46 minute periods (two free periods a day + lunch). I taught here for 3 years, originally starting on 1/2 days but moving up to full time with COVID. Online learning was most of my tenure (unfortunately).

My new district has block scheduling that rotates A/B days, per day there are three 99 minute blocks and one 69 minute block that does not rotate ( I have one free block every other day + 30 minute lunch). I was very excited for this because I have been wanting to do block scheduling since I was a student in High School. Unfortunately, I was given what the other teachers have dubbed ""that schedule"". 

The classes I teach now are Remedial English 9/10, where instead of meeting on A/B days, I have the same students for double blocks (meaning we meet everyday) for 99 minutes as well as the ""half block"" daily. All of the students were students that failed each of their English classes up to this point, for a variety of reasons. Many of these students ""travel"" together to all their classes because they have failed each of their other core subjects and are taking double blocks in math & science as well.

&#x200B;

**My actual request for aid:** I am looking for ways to incorporate different approaches, games, activities to the classroom to continue meaningful learning without making it start to feel like they are overloaded with reading & writing instruction. 

Currently I have students complete an ***Article of the Week*** (Gallagher), use ***NoRedInk*** bi-weekly for continuing writing practice that we have done together in class, and try to have one class per week dedicated to ***visual texts*** (music video, paintings, episode of a documentary, etc.), but I'd like to find some more ways to diversify the type of work students are completing to make it a little more fun and engaging. 

Once we continue into the year, I will use ***book clubs*** with the students (first time giving it a shot) to help give more agency, among all the other benefits. I have started scaffolding for ***discussion based activities*** as well, which I used some murder mystery materials from previous years when teaching argumentation (no Slip or Trip just yet), but admittedly can develop how I administer those.

I am currently looking for a way to practice **vocabulary** without using worksheets that students can complete independently. Last year I had students use *Membean*. I didn't love it (and neither did the kids) but it was a nice alternative to the other options I had found up to this point. 

I am looking into using *Gimkit* as well, since I have heard some good things about it, but don't have any solid plans just yet.

If anyone has any advice, projects, activities, procedures, or even units that you have done that students enjoyed, please feel free to let me know. This is my first time working with English 9/10, first time on block scheduling, and each of my classes has between 20-25 students that are all doing their best, but haven't had the greatest experience in schools up to this point. I'm no stranger to the last point, but I definitely have a long way to go with hammering out units and activities so I can start to focus on differentiation and interventions to get them to the next phase of their HS career.",xbny65,7,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/xbny65/first_year_in_new_district_heck_of_a_schedule/,teaching

Today we were having a birthday party at a painting place for my 7 year old daughter and I look up and see a familiar face.  He’s there with his three kids.  I’m not sure why he’s even out because he was supposed to be put away for quite some time.

473,I desperately need advice,"Okay so I'm about to start an internship where I'll be an English teacher for low-intermediate English language learners, and god am I terrified. I have never taken a singular education course or have any experience teaching besides peer tutoring in high school (that was 4 years ago at this point). I have no idea how to make a lesson plan, manage a classroom, or just teach in any aspect of the word. I took this internship because I was interested in becoming an ESL teacher after I graduate college, and I figured some real experience would be beneficial. Well, now I just want to drop out of this internship. My advisor assured me I'd be fine even after I very clearly expressed how unprepared I am for this, and that I do not have any teaching experience. He sent the first day lesson plan, and I thought my head was gonna explode when I looked at it. I have no idea what I am doing. I don't think I'm going to be able to provide these students with the education they deserve. They're here to learn English and become more fluent, but idk if I can give that them. I'm not even sure if I want to be a teacher anymore. I'm freaking out. Please I need advice on how to get through this.

476,My AP is leaving (update),"I posted yesterday about my AP leaving. He is incredible and I cried when he told me. Well, I wasn’t just crying because I’m going to miss him. That’s part of it, but I also know that means a lot more work for me, and I figured it was going to be work I wasn’t getting paid for. My tears were really selfish tears. So this morning my principal asked me and another teacher into his office. He asked if we could split AP duties between the both of us while still teaching. We’d get a minimum 15k pay increase (I’ll be asking for more, maybe 20 or 25). This is almost exactly what I was afraid of, but with extra pay… the thing is neither of us have masters degrees or admin licenses. I feel like it’s not even legal for us to accept this offer, but I don’t know the legalities surrounding this issue. I have the weekend to think about it. We are both leaning toward yes, but agreed we’d be asking for a better pay bump.  If we refuse the offer they’ll look for someone new, but then literally everyone in the office is new. Is this a terrible idea? Help!!!

Edit: Thank you all so much for the advice!!! I’m going to ask for an exact rundown of responsibilities IN WRITING for EACH of us, not just “you’ll both tackle this task” etc. because I know I’ll end up doing more work than my counterpart. I’m certainly going to be asking for more than 15k, there is no way I’d do this job for that much, and I told my principal that up front right away. They’re in a tough spot because neither of us have a full class load, though we are full-time. We have been here since the school started, and we know the procedures better than basically everyone, so I understand why they think it’s a good band-aid for this wound. I know I’d personally rather say no; the part where I’m stuck is I know I’m going to be doing more work regardless. I’d rather be paid for doing it than not. I’m also going to make it clear that I’m not comfortable with this, and would only be willing to do so as an emergency solution for this year (pending that they are able to fulfill my other requests). As far as training goes, I’m close with the current AP, and am confident he’d be there to support me. Right now, I am leaning “no.” I think they should give us training regardless, so that we could help whoever they hire for the new AP position. While they are trying to fill the position, we could help with other tasks so it isn’t all on the principal. Then I go back to what I’m passionate about.",xa8ct7,42,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/xa8ct7/my_ap_is_leaving_update/,teaching

We were aware many were leaving, but not all. My principal left unexpectedly and it came to light that they’d done nothing over the summer. I feel so bad for my new principal, it seems every time a position gets filled a new one opens. My AP came into my room this morning and opened with, “it’s not fair for me to drop this on you..” I was like, “I’m ready, spill the beans.” He proceeded to tell me next week is his last week. I cried. I cried so hard. I wasn’t ready, not for that. This man holds our school together. I truly don’t know how we’ll manage without him. He apologized and I told him no, that I understand. This place is a shit show and they didn’t tell you that nothing had been done over the summer while you were across the pond. That’s wholly unacceptable. But fuck me, I’m so gutted. When the kindergarten teacher left I thought we’d be okay. The secretary left and I thought, alright that’s fine. The SPED teacher left and I felt like I’d lost a friend.

I am teaching a rather large number of students in two of my classes this semester (70+).A week into the semester and  I can already feel the strain on my vocal chords.

The classrooms are equipped with a mic and speaker setup. The only drawback is that the mic is fixed to the podium and I need to move around alot.

Update - Thanks everyone for suggestions. After some research I bought this and it works like a charm.

480,"I’ve been thinking about quitting, but don’t really have a solid fall back plan","Hey everyone! Long post ahead. 

For context, I am a fourth year teacher in AR, meaning my first year was the year covid shut down schools. I have yet to have a “normal” year, which my coworkers with more time in have to cling on to and look at to say “it won’t always be this way!”  Last year was close, but I had a lot happen in my personal life, so not quite there.

I am at the second highest paying district in my region, but my take home is just slightly above 30k. In this economy, this isn’t feasible. I have no kids and I’m already working a part time job after school. I cannot fathom taking on more student loans to get a MSE to only make 2-3k more a YEAR, when I could go into a nursing or medical 2-year program to make double what I bring home now. Yes I have lots of time off, but if I’m too broke to utilize it and having to work a second job, what’s the point? 

The ONLY thing keeping me in the field currently is the schedule. Terrible to say, but it’s true. I am so jaded at this point. I get berated by parents for kids having consequences to their actions daily. These kids (upper elementary/middle school) don’t listen, and feel comfortable enough to argue with me over the simplest of things. I don’t know when the environment of education took such a nose dive, but I am feeling like I am in the trenches. AR has started the switch to SpEd inclusion, with no true guidance as to how to implement it, and so it’s just doubled my workload. The school nurses have even told us to stop sending kids unless it’s for medication or an emergency and to handle things within our rooms. Up until this year, my admin has been terrible. No guidance, help, support, or follow through and would very openly pick favorites who were idolized for throwing others under the bus. I was once called in for reminding students wear a mask during the pandemic and a board-mandated mask mandate was in place, and reprimanded for following the board policy. I wake up every day dreading going to work to see what fresh hell awaits me. 

I guess I can hold out and hope it improves, switch districts, or switch careers.

486,Three weeks in and we have to switch kids?,"I teach in elementary school, and apparently  this year my school got the bright idea to try and put all the SPED students in one class. Our grade had too many, 7/9 students in another class are on an IEP. 3 of those students are severe behaviors and should not have been put together in the same class. One of those students recently moved out of the school, so now the class has two “major” behaviors/IEP and 4 other IEP students. My co teacher, who I love and adore, was really struggling with the three students when they were all in that class and advocated that her class had an illegal ratio.

We received word on Tuesday: we have to swap 3 kids in your classes (there are three in my grade level). We are three weeks into the school year and I am like well. I love all my students, even my behaviors/turds that I have and the class dynamic is great so far. My students who were in fights daily last year from the start of the school year are excited to come to school and are respectful and listening. When we have issues we stop and address them as a whole group. 

I refuse to “give away” any of my students in my class because half of them have abandonment issues as is. I swapped a student who has not shown up yet to school and likely will not because he is a voucher student because that was my only choice. The only three special Ed students that my coteacher really offered were her three most challenging students left. 

Now, she has no behaviors minus one sassy kid. I’m really trying to be super happy for her, but it’s so clear that the student swapped into my class is not thriving at all. She almost had explosive outbursts five times today, she instigated two other students, swore at students in our class in Spanish, and made two students cry and get in trouble. One of these kids was in her clsss last year and constantly getting into fights then. NONE of this happened in her other class. She had adjusted and according to my coteacher she is just super chatty and had work refusal with her. The dynamic is SO different and she is constantly asking to go back to visit her other teacher. 

My co teacher has expressed that “oh but she’s super sweet” and “oh yeah but your new class has that stuff too sweety.” I understand she was so overwhelmed in her class beforehand, but I feel like the change has totally messed up my students and they are clearly miserable.  I want to be honest with my coteacher but every time I try to indicate the issue I’m having, she seems to avoid the idea of her student being swapped with another. I totally get relationships but this feels like a very unfair switch. 

I’m literally going through so much personally right now too so I have no idea how to proceed. I talked to the guidance counselor and she seemed concerned about the impact on my students, but my team teacher is clearly in the “it’s your problem now” mindset (not in a rude way, more like a this is the situation and it’s not changing way).",x8p79n,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/x8p79n/three_weeks_in_and_we_have_to_switch_kids/,teaching

489,Sick first day back,"It's my first day back at school with the kiddos today (grade 2, my 8th year teaching). Yesterday was our first day back as staff. I'm in a new school too so I'm not familiar with the community yet. My daughter has been home sick the last 2 days. Of course, she gave it to me. She coughs in my face all night. It's really hard to avoid getting her germs. Also, how do you say no to a sick 3 year old melting down because she feels like crap and mommy is leaving. Of course I have to give her hugs and kisses. I guess I prioritize her comfort over my health.

I was fine when I left for work. Greeting the kids at 830, I thought, ""wow, my legs are strangely sore today"". Then around 1030 I start getting exponentially worse. Headache, rough voice (although a pretty mild cough and my throat wasn't very sore). I couldn't speak loud enough to be heard without making myself puke. Nausea. Chills. Body feeling like I was hit by a truck. I had to leave at lunch. It's the worse timing ever.

1st year of the pandemic, I took 1 sick day to stay home with my daughter. It was great. I was there for my kids. They could rely on me. My own daughter was 1 1/2, in daycare all day, and sick maybe once. Last year (2nd year pandemic), she moved daycares and she was sick every 2-4 weeks. I missed so much more work and still, I think only 1 or 2 of those days was my own illness (with both of us sick), the rest just her. So still not bad. Still haven't had covid, unless this is it. My entire career prior to having my daughter, 99% of the sick days I took were mental health related, not physical illness. I just never get sick. I'm pretty disappointed cuz I feel the new daycare is the problem. I dropped her off last week and one of her classmates had 2 giant boogers running down to his mouth. I've seen this multiple times. It's frustrating when you follow the rules and others don't, and you pay the price.

I'm grateful I was at least with my kiddos for the morning. I didn't even get to tell them I was going home. I feel so bad for letting them down. There's so much to learn routine wise in the first few days, and I'm going to have to somehow prepare a sub plan for it. Doubt I'll be better tomorrow.

501,Preliminary credential in California,"Hi all. I’ve scoured the good ole’ internet for a bit on this question but that information is quite confusing and contradictory in some instances. 

I received my preliminary teaching credential sometime in 2021. All I know (without having it to look at right now) is that is expires in 2026. 

What happens if I am not able to clear my credential during the five year preliminary credential period?  Am I screwed?  I know I’m getting a little ahead of myself but I enjoy stressing myself out and existing in a constant state of anxiety and panic. 

I am a single subject art teacher. There aren’t quite as many art teacher job vacancies as there are vacancies for other single subjects, SpEd credentials, or general education credentials. I worked last year beginning in mid/late august through earlier this month for a total employment of like—a full year and ten days. I requested application to the induction program offered at my hell hole charter school but they’d always get back to me late…late enough that I wasn’t able to participate in the induction program. Hell hole charter school does have a one year induction program—but considering the job made me want to put a plastic bag over my head I recently quit as I was having un-a living ideation. Just as I was getting accepted into the induction program.  Regardless I could not stand another minute at the hell hole charter school. 

So my question is—this year is basically chucked out of the window. I’m looking at subbing, subbing long term, trying to apply for another art job (but only charter schools seem to be having empty positions for some ODD REASON) but I won’t be able to get all the steps necessary to get hired in time to apply for an induction during the 2022-2023 school year. 

I’m kind of freaking out. That leaves me three years to complete two years of an induction program. I applied to about three or four art teaching jobs during the summer but wasn’t hired and had to return to the hell hole, which broke me and now I might want to take some time to work in *not education* until the next school year comes around. 

In the worst case scenario—I can’t find employment in my single subject and cannot complete the induction program. From what I have read preliminary credentials in California can’t be renewed———unless, you begin an induction program as your prelim is expiring, in which case you can file for an extension. I think. You may also be eligible to apply for an extension if say, you were dying and that made you unable to complete the induction program. 

Aside from the “extenuating circumstances” I can’t find anything about what happens if you’re unable to clear your preliminary credential through a two year induction program during the first five years. It seems like an awful lot of waste that my preliminary credential goes *poof* and those years of taking courses on top of working full time mean jack shit. 

Of course I’m thinking in worst case scenarios. Worst case scenario I am not hired as an art teacher in the following three years and my prelim is expires. Is that…it? In which case…what the fuck?  Someone please help me out cause I’m freaking out. As if California didn’t make us jump through enough hoops to teach already.",x76ezv,3,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/x76ezv/preliminary_credential_in_california/,teaching
502,Game and activity ideas to do with one student only?,"Hello. I got a part-time job recently, and now teach ""advanced"" French (level B1 max) to 4 and 5 graders. Because it's advanced French, I only have 3 students, one of which is a fourth grader and is my only pupil for this grade (grades aren't mashed together). While everything's great with my grade 5 students, I struggle to keep *him* engaged.

His French is pretty good, he can follow a lesson in French without a problem, can understand a text, and is able to speak. We need to focus on grammar, which I've been trying to do. But, of course, grammar isn't very fun and he gets bored quickly. How can I make a grammar lesson more engaging?

505,"""Kids should be allowed to go to the bathroom""","No *SHIT*. Of course they should be allowed to just go when they need to. They shouldn't have to raise a hand and ask. I shouldn't have to stop a lesson to write out a pass. It's demeaning and does not reflect real life outside of high school. 

BUT

They vape. They cheat. They wander. They have sex in the stalls. They have fights and jump other students. They self-harm. They do *Godknowswhat* in the bathrooms and we can't have cameras or guards there, can we? We police the bathrooms so much because THEY CANNOT BE TRUSTED AND THEY ARE MINORS. Many of them could just go but we can't take the chance that they are doing something harmful or illegal because if THAT happens we'll get blamed for every single hair harmed on their head.

If I have to see one more post on any social media or comment in a YT video or hear another parent complain about how we're mistreating their child because they can't pee when they want I will *EXPLODE*. How about you teach your kid to adhere to one of the most basic rules of society which is that bathrooms are for using the bathroom and that's it?

Edit: Some of us are really missing the point. This is not me reveling in taking away bathroom privileges. It's me being frustrated that I have to take away a right to go to the bathroom because there's no good solution (at least at my district-I'm going to mention those electronic passes to my principal).

I’ve even witnessed my own subordinate slap her son backhanded across the face for his in class behavior.  Most of my black students also receive physical punishment at home and literally tell me about it.  In my culture (I’m a different minority group), hitting kids is really not a thing, I only knew one person who had a dad that physically hit them (and his mom later married my father after she divorced his dad) but I know it’s a thing in other cultures.  I have white students who also receive physical punishment but it’s more universal with my black students.  

My question is, where do I draw a line?  If I reported every kid based on my mandatory reporter status, I’d have like 4 students and half my coworkers would be gone.  The kids usually tell me about it.  I’ve reported a coworker before but my boss was also black and excused the behavior with a “it’s a cultural thing” response.

524,Yesterday was hell…,"We just finished the third week of school and on Wednesday and yesterday, students took a test on their computers called a Growth Test, which they’ll take it three times this year (Aug, Dec, and May). The test is under state testing conditions where there is to be absolutely no talking, cell phones and watches must be in their lockers, they can only come in the classroom with their Chromebook and charger, and as the proctor I have to read word for word what’s in the proctor handbook.

School starts at 8:30 and school wide testing was scheduled from 8:45-11:15 and students are supposed to stay quiet the entire time even after they’re done testing. I have to collect their test ticket, scratch paper, pencil, and they aren’t allowed to play on their Chromebooks even after they’re done (and the test is only 25 questions). I was assigned a pretty rough group of 28 kids. Some were on my roster and some weren’t. A handful of them came walking in with more than their Chromebook and charger and I had to redirect them to put the extra stuff in their lockers and it took us even longer to get started. 

As I’m reading from the proctor handbook, some kids refused to stop talking, continued to laugh and snicker, interrupt me and ask for a bottle of water, and I had to wait for them to be quiet multiple times. They were quiet for a little and as I’m passing out their scratch paper and pencils, the chit chat keeps going. I even moved a few peoples seats (which was hard with 30 seats and 28 kids) and it helped a little but not much. After telling these kids to stop talking for the umpteenth time, I finally send a Google chat to admin (which we were told to do during training if some students refuse to cooperate) and they reply “Try to manage the behaviors on your own” 🫠

529,"I am ready to resign, but I am scared","Hi all.  I posted a few weeks ago about how my job was affecting my mental health to the point that I was idealizing being unalive. Well, I am finally ready to give my two weeks but find myself being a chicken shit.  My boss un-nerves me to the point I am scared of them.  They belittle me, despite my coming forth about dealing with mental health problems and ADHD.

I decided I was going to ask for help on one last thing and if it wasn't granted--I would quit.  I have had the letter written, I just changed the date it was written on and the date of my last day.  Then I found out my mother went to the hospital by ambulance.  I went to our meeting crying and disoriented and they did ask me if we should meet some other time but I had already skipped lunch and was like no its fine.  We went over my lessons and discrepancies in them and I could not for the life of me answer the questions correctly.  My mind was with my senior citizen mom, alone in the hospital having a possible stroke.  Although the things the admin said prior were the scripted ""I am so sorry"" there was a coldness about them.  For example, coworker walks in and sees me crying, is awkward like me, and says I don't know how to be very comforting I am sorry but I will try--and hugged me.  They were GENUINELY CONCERNED, she kept saying ""I am sorry, I had no idea"".  Another staff member not quite at the rank of my boss but still above my standing came in with genuine concern and asked if I had wanted to leave.  I said yes between tears and she asked if I needed a hug, I said yes, and she hugged me so hard--like, I have never been given affection really.  And she was like, ""I want you to calm down before you drive.  I want you to be safe.  You have to be calm in order to drive safely okay?  You drive to that hospital.""

Admin comes in shortly after visibly upset.  Theres staff on campus that can legally substitute in last minute situations but they get pulled from their normal post. Admin scolds me for not having mentioned it at the beginning of our meeting when they asked if I was okay--which hello?  No I am not okay.  

Anyway, I am teaching eleven classes, five each day.  We are on a block schedule, we will say A/B, A, B, A, B.  I have to write two curriculums.  An objective linked to a standard must be written in a lesson plan which needs to be written daily.  I need to write lesson plans DAILY, across five grades--since I can use A & B lesson plan one after the other, that comes out to a total of three lessons plans.  One for the non block day, and two for the block days.  Across five grades is fifteen.  Without grading.  Without the worksheets, without the parent contact, the slides...I have to have 5 lesson plans every day...two weeks ahead of time.  For the end of this week I should be 15 x 2 lesson plans ahead.  I need to write 30 lesson plans in two days to achieve this, while working from 8:00-4:30.

That's too much.  30 lesson plans ahead is too much.  300 students are too many students. Teaching 11 different homerooms is too much.  I have spent my nights and weekends working forgoing outings with friends--to ""catch up"" but I can't.  I have never felt like I couldn't do enough in one day.  But I can't warp time--and I don't want to.

I didn't give them the resignation letter today because it was a \*significant day in their lives\* but I feel belittled by them.  My old boss quit last year a month before the year ended.  I guess if the head honcho can quit before the year ends why can't I?

I really enjoy being a teacher.  I think I am a good one.  I know it is cheesy but I love my students and I will miss them.  My coworkers are also great.  I am just drained, continue to have s\*\*\*\*\* ideation, no time off ever on the weekends either.  I have a ""long"" weekend but, if I work how they want me to--I won't have a weekend at all.  I can't be a good teacher, employee, friend or family member right now.  Admin's attitude towards my mom being in the hospital infuriated me.

I am not under a contract.  They can terminate me at any time and I can quit any time with or without a two weeks notice. I plan to give two weeks.  It's almost been a month of teaching and I do not have the furniture necessary to teach in my classroom--so I am going to homerooms.

There is one admin ""higher up"" than my admin, who is being trained by ""higher up"" admin.  ""Higher Up"" admin don't scare me as much as ""admin admin"" and I kind of want to tell them--so they can go with me to tell the other person.

To be honest I just want to email my boss the resignation.  However I am advised that it isn't a good idea.  So I have to face them. Bleh.  My mental health is at an all time low.  It sucks that my classes are fine, teaching is fine, my coworkers fine--but admin is running me to the ground.  They need me more than I need them right now.  There's been jobs for charters in my subject for MONTHS, including one in the same network.  But no one wants to fill the charter positions and I get it now!

I want to teach HS like I had planned.  Maybe I won't find something this year or this far into a year but I can at least get a full time job that starts and ends at the time it says it does.  So I can somewhat enjoy parts of my life.

I am ready.  I have the letter written.  I just don't know how to go about it.  I feel bad that I had a large budget and bough a lot of things that they'll have to figure out how to use. but man, its a dog eat dog world out there.  I have to watch out for me.

It's amazing what a decent night's sleep and a new day can do.

Today was still hard. I teach secondary, and some of my class periods were still \*really\* tough today.

But it was better.

The student who gaslit me yesterday apologized to me today and shared something personal about herself to help let me get to know her better.  The student who messed around in my class yesterday... well, he still messed around in my class today, but \*IN A LESS DISRUPTIVE WAY\* so I'm still calling that an improvement.

When kids acted up, I didn't let myself get overly upset.  I just tried to focus on established procedures to deal with behavior.  And I realized I \*am\* getting better at handling the classes. Well, most of my classes: 4 out of 5 is pretty good!

533,Classroom Management Advice Needed,"*long post ahead!*

Hi fellow teachers!

This is my 3rd year teaching 5th grade reading/language arts, and I am just struggling with one of my classes this year. 

I feel like every year I always have one class that’s a little more difficult than the other, but by the end of the day I shrug it off and just restart the next day. This year is different though.

I have one section that is genuinely straight up rude and disrespectful. We spent the first week going over class procedures and expectations, and they did fine. The next week we started content and it just has gone downhill. Talking while I am teaching, flipping each other off while I’m writing on the board, name calling, disrespecting me in the class and I’m just now feeling beat down everyday. 

Today threw me for a loop because they just continued to talk while I’m going over vocabulary, about nothing relating to our lesson, and I stopped to discuss how that was disrespectful and try to redirect. My biggest problem student started talking in a rude manner and I was answering his question (apparently before he was done) and shouted at me to “not talk while he was talking.” I honestly saw red and just lost it with the class, which in hindsight maybe I shouldn’t have, but I was at my wits end. I tried to move on after but they still continued to talk as I started reading the story for their lesson, and I just said okay fine work on this by yourself then if you know what to do. It was quite after that, but I know most of those kids aren’t on grade level, so they probably couldn’t even read the story. But now going into the rest of the week, I’m looking for advice on where to go from here.

I want to regain control and show I’m not a pushover, but wondering if you all could give me advice on how I should tackle this. I’ve already revoked computer privileges for the foreseeable future and have cut recess time, but clearly it’s not working.

Thank you all for any advice or what I should do differently!",x2v66u,6,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/x2v66u/classroom_management_advice_needed/,teaching
534,Are all Directors/Administrators fake?,"I just really need to get this off of my chest and get things into perspective.

I have been a para for a PFA room for about 5 months now. This is my first professional role in an educator position, and I feel like my center director is setting me up to fail…

No matter what I do, I feel like there is always criticism. And I’m ok with being critiqued to do better, especially when it comes to being responsible for children that are not mine, but I would prefer the criticism not come from other people who overheard it from the source. And this is how everyone in the center is treated. If the director has a problem with you or with what you are doing, they will not tell you to your face. They will instead complain loud enough for others to hear.

I have gone back to school to obtain my second bachelors in ece. Each step has been met without excitement but instead annoyance. And now that I am going back, my hours are being severely cut (being let off 4 hours before my class starts) when there is no real reason to.

Today, I had to change a couple of kids who had accidents before I left, because another teacher came in to relieve me and help my coteacher so that we would stay in ratio (1:10). It put me over by about 20 minutes in this process and I just found out that my director was watching me intently from the cameras in our room and cussing about me still being on the clock. 

She has complained about me trying to stay in ration when I need to leave the room (saying I leave too much) and then she complains if we are out of ratio to take a child to the bathroom (saying it isn’t safe). How are you supposed to “win” in a situation like this?",x2xci6,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/x2xci6/are_all_directorsadministrators_fake/,teaching

537,"Teachers, what do you need from your school nurse?","Hi teachers, I work at a school as a healthcare provider. I’m the only healthcare provider on campus. I’m essentially the “school nurse” but not a licensed nurse. I am a certified healthcare provider, however. I have been at my job for five years now and I feel like I have mastered my work but that makes me feel complacent. So I’m asking you, what do you always wish your school nurse would do or do differently? I’ve asked my faculty this and haven’t gotten much feed back. I don’t want to assume it’s because I can’t improve, because we always can and I’m striving to get better at this ever year. So any wise words from the classroom on things I may not have considered? I am also the trainer for all school health professionals in my charter and I’m always looking for ways to improve not just myself but all the health providers I train.

538,Teaching a rude group of kids this year. Does it get better?,"I've been teaching for a while, but I've just started at a new school. The kids here are a lot more rude than my old school. They don't follow directions, they don't do their work, and they insult me constantly. They tell me they don't feel confident reading to themselves and then they pretend to cough the whole time when I try to read it aloud to them. Last week I got hit in the head with a marker. I want to make lessons fun, but I'm scrambling to learn new curriculum, and it's been torture trying to get them to do simple tasks. I want to build relationships, but I'm just disciplining them a lot instead.

There were 2 students who I thought I had made progress with yesterday. Today one messed around in my class all day and then blew me off when I tried to talk to him. The other lost something at lunch and I held the class outside while we looked for her things, and then she gaslit me when we came inside complaining that I kept them late.

It's only the 3rd week of school here but I already feel like I've failed. All day the kids tell me that I'm mean and they hate my class. I don't know what to do. Help.",x236vu,32,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/x236vu/teaching_a_rude_group_of_kids_this_year_does_it/,teaching

541,Where is the line?,"I’m a social studies teacher. The majority of my content is learning new people, events, and places. It’s A LOT of information that they need to get. 

I’ve always been taught that “sage on the stage” and just lecturing isn’t effective. Which is fine, that’s not really my style anyway. I’ve been taught that student directed work and having them find answers on their own is better. 

However, when I look at my class and they’re working on a web quest or other kind of activity, it doesn’t seem like they’re engaged at all. And I don’t feel like they’re retaining anything they’re writing down or finding. I feel like I can be more engaging with lectures. 

Obviously ideally, every lesson would be creative simulations but I don’t have the bandwidth for that everyday. 

So. Where is line between lecture and student directed work, because their quick check scores I do every so often are showing the opposite.",x1ye69,42,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/x1ye69/where_is_the_line/,teaching

As a math teacher I felt I was pretty good in a lot of my computer and math classes I took in college and generally found more of the computer ones interesting. My brother in law does cyber security as well, and seems to really enjoy it. A major part of teaching I hate is the lack of separation between school and home.
