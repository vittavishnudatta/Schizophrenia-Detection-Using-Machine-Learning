0,My (30m) fiance (27f) won't wear the engagement ring,"My fiance (27f) and i (30m) have been together for nearly 1.5 years and we've been engaged for about a year. Because of my job I had to move out of the state and we've been long distance relationship for over 6 months now. Ever since I've left, I noticed she stopped wearing the engagement ring. While we're on the phone I would ask if she's wearing it and she would say no. She says she doesn't want to ""dirty it"" and wants to save it. But she doesn't wear anything else on the ring and it makes me feel weird. She really was excited to get engaged and loved it, and now she doesn't even wear it. And it doesn't make me feel any better that she has a job that interacts with a lot of people and many people compliment her on how pretty she is. 

Lately, we got into some heated arguments about the ring and my expectations of her to wear it regularly as I have spent 2.5 months wage into buying her a ring she dreamed of. She says ""it's not like we're married"" and doesn't really wear it. It got pretty heated and I was annoyed so out of frustration I said ""if you're not going to wear it, you might as well as give it back"". I felt like the least she could do was wear an engagement ring how to commitment to each other but she won't do that. So she won't wear the ring (or anything else on the ring finger) nor will she give me the ring back. 

I told her we can start planning on getting married once our job will align in the same state (which may take about another 6-12months). Am I being unreasonable to expect her to wear the ring regularly?

Edit: few things that are coming up so I wanted to provide clarity 

1. The ring is comfortable for her. It's not too tight or bothersome when she wears it. She's been given other alternative such as silicone ring and Tiffany band to wear since she wanted to save the engagement ring but won't wear bands as ""those are for married people"".
2. I wasn't staking a claim by getting engaged early. In fact, she was the one who wanted to get engaged super early and even wanted to move in with me. She would tell me daily how her ring finger is empty and how it needs something shiny on it. I was happy with her and saw a good future together, so I tapped into my savings to give her what she wanted (I wanted too). 
3. Yes, I realize we got engaged very quicky, read 2 again. 

Tldr: fiance won't wear the engagement ring while in long distance relationship. Won't wear anything on engagement ring nor give the ring back",z35mbv,334,243,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z35mbv/my_30m_fiance_27f_wont_wear_the_engagement_ring/,relationships
1,"I (25F) work with mostly all men (20s-50s, around 50 of them) and I don't know how to navigate relationships with them","I'm 25F. I work in a very highly skilled, niche field (I have a master's in petroleum engineering). I've been here for two years. Without going into much detail, I'm on the same ""level"" as some who've been here for 20+ years, payscale wise. It's weird to explain.

I work with about 50 men, 20s-50s. Generally most of them are nice but they don't really speak to me much and I don't know how to bond with them/what to do. Mostly when we talk it's them saying they just got a raise/promotion/new car or something, and I don't know how to respond to stuff like that. 

They go out a lot together and I'm never invited anymore. I used to be, but since I've started a serious relationship those invitations have gone away. My SO has no issue with it, but I've heard from some of my co-workers THEY have an issue with it.

I know some of their girlfriends and wives have had issues with me working with ""their men."" Additionally, some friends I used to have at my work have distanced themselves from me since I've been in this relationship.

I feel very lonely at work. There's one other woman who works with me but she's currently remote and in her 60s, ready to retire. I've been looking at other jobs but I feel like this is a great fit for me.

My question is, what can I do at work? I just come in and do my job. I don't feel appreciated or like I contribute in any meaningful way anymore.

\*\*TL;DR\*\* 25F, work in a highly niche field with mostly men (all 20s-50s, about 50 of them). When we chat, it's mostly about their own accomplishments and promotions, their wives/girlfriends don't really like me, and I've stopped getting invited out since I began a new relationship. I don't want to leave, but I don't know what to do/how to navigate this.",z2ruxk,1103,164,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z2ruxk/i_25f_work_with_mostly_all_men_20s50s_around_50/,relationships
2,My [30 M] wife [28 F] found underwear under the couch that doesn’t belong to her,"My wife found underwear under the couch that isn’t hers and I have absolutely no idea where it came from. We’ve had many female visitors and overnight guests and they all don’t recognize the underwear. This is a completely anonymous post and I have no personal info on my profile so believe me when I say I’ve never once cheated on my wife and have no idea where that underwear came from. She says she believes me but I can feel her growing distant and she’s started checking my phone while I’m asleep. What should I do?

3,Am I 22F in the wrong for making my boyfriend 23M choose between a week away with his friends or our relationship?,"Me 22F and my bf 23M have been together for over 2 years now. My boyfriend was meant to go on a boys trip for a week (main idea of the trip was for them to go and party). 2 weeks before they were scheduled to go I found out that my boyfriend had been cheating on me for the previous 11 months and all of his friends were aware of it. I broke up with him instantly.

Because we live together neither of us were in the position to just pick up and move out. Due to this he spent the next 4 days begging me to give him a second chance. After the four days I gave in and agreed to give him a second chance as long as he didn't go on the holiday with his friends as I wouldn't feel comfortable after everything happened so recently as well as the fact that all of those boys knew and had no problem with it. He initially agreed and said he would do anything to make this work and to gain my trust back.

A few days before they were set to leave for the trip my boyfriend starting to get really angry that I wasn't letting him go. I said multiple times that if he wanted to go he could, but I would breakup with him because I wasn't okay with it. He ended up not going but the whole time was taking everything out on me. I have tried to explain that I was already hesitant to get back together with him after everything and I believe after what he has done my trust needs to be earnt back with actions and time. Not given back instantly just to see if he lives up to what he says. All of his friends have been trash talking me for putting him in the position to have to choose.

 \*\*TL;DR\*\* I 22F found out my boyfriend 23M had been cheating on me for the past 11 months of our 2yr relationship. He was planned to go on a boys trip with his friends 2 weeks later. I didn't feel comfortable with him going after finding everything out so recently. Do you think I am in the wrong for putting him in the position to chose between our relationship and the getaway with his friends?",z34ybc,127,142,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z34ybc/am_i_22f_in_the_wrong_for_making_my_boyfriend_23m/,relationships
4,My [27F] dog passed away and my partner [35M] lacked empathy,"I am struggling to forgive my [27F] partner [35M] of 3 years. My family dog, I'll call her Millie, of nearly 15 years passed away in my arms a few days ago. She was the best girl ever and I loved her so much.

I am heartbroken and full of emotion right now, so I want some outside opinions. My partner recently moved here from out of state and has been staying with my mom for a few months while he finds a place to live. We had been long distance for a few years before he moved. I live a few hours from my mom's place and was visiting at the time.

Well, on Monday morning he was due to go pick up the keys for his new apartment. I was going to go with him (I'm not moving in yet, was planning to in 6 months). Millie has been unwell for a while but on Monday morning, just an hour before we were due to leave, she passed away peacefully.

My mom and I were devastated. Couldn't stop crying and we still are. My partner was still getting his stuff together to leave. I was shocked he was still going to go, and after I said that he offered to stay. He didn't even offer me a hug until I asked. 

Anyway we agreed he would leave. I think it was for the best, especially for my mom as she couldn't be comfortable crying in front of him. As he was walking out the door, I kept saying something like 'she's not really dead, she can't be, this isn't real'. 

My partner then replied, in a really harsh tone, ""she's dead"" multiple times. I said stop saying that. And he said it again then raised his voice and said ""she's dead, that's what a therapist would tell you."" I was so shocked at this and just shut the door in his face.

At this point Millie had only passed away 30 minutes ago. He has subsequently apologized and sent flowers and a card for Millie but it doesn't make up for what he said. I don't know if anything can.

He showed so little respect for Millie, for me and for my mom who gave him somewhere to live for free for months. I'm so disgusted that this is the person I've been in a relationship with. My mom heard him say all this and she thinks it was said in a dismissive/heartless tone. Knowing him, it was said as a dig, it was said in a harsh way.

At the same time, it was a high stress/high emotion situation so am I judging him too harshly? Right now I feel like I can never forgive him. My mom says I need to consider it from his perspective too, he was just going to get his keys and move. 

TLDR: Partner lacked empathy and made thoughtless comments after my dog passed away. Now I am struggling to forgive him. Can/should I try to get over this?",z34jk5,112,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z34jk5/my_27f_dog_passed_away_and_my_partner_35m_lacked/,relationships
5,"an incident between me and a friend ended our friendship, and our different recollections of it are making me sick to my stomach and questioning my sanity","I \[20M\] was best friends with a \[F19\] classmate of mine in college for the past 10 months. We met in the fall, got super close and could talk to each other about just about anything in the world. We would hang out after our classes and eventually we were either always on the phone with each other or doing some activity in person. At no point during these 10 months did either of us initiate towards anything more than the friendship we had, although we were always touchy (always platonic though from both sides). 

I can only speak for myself but I think we appreciated the comfort of each other because we had no one else that was like ""our person"" I guess. My friend had previous trust issues from men in the past and it made our friendship quite shaky at times because she always would always question my intentions, wondered why I wasn't being an asshole to her, and ultimately said she was waiting for me to mess things up. Obviously though I told her none of that stuff would ever happen but she could keep thinking about it if she wanted to, I thought all I had to do was continue being myself. 

I just want to add this in here because it becomes important later: I have ADHD & anxiety and my friend suffers from depression & anxiety. Our shared experiences in terms of our mental health is what contributed a lot to understanding each other. 

Now that I have the background information out of the way, I want to start from around two weeks ago today. My friend was wearing a hoodie and looking for her phone and I knew it was in the hoodie pouch, without really thinking, I backhanded the hoodie pouch, she laughed about it and said how I touched her stomach and I was lucky to not touch her private area because there would be consequences if I did. I agreed and laughed about it too and we both just forgot about that event. 

Just this Friday, we both pulled into the parking lot at the same time and got out to greet each other before our class. She was wearing one of my jackets for the duration of this week and on that day. She was having trouble buttoning it up so I asked her if she wanted me to do it for her, she said yes, I buttoned it up for her and finished. The jacket was protruding outward, it was quite puffed up, so I backhanded it to flatten it back down. Firstly, I want to acknowledge that I should not have done this. She gave me permission to button up her jacket but did not tell me I could flatten the jacket so just in itself I was wrong for this, I want to make that clear.

 I thought I just backhanded the middle of the jacket, but immediately my friend asked me if I just smacked her boob (I want to make it clear that I did not backhand the jacket hard and only ever made contact with the jacket itself because it was puffed up, although as I said, I should have asked for permission to do this and not take initiative to do it without asking because thats still wrong). I told her there's no way, I hit the middle of the jacket, not the upper area where her boob was, and she immediately told me I was gaslighting her, so I said okay you know what maybe I did that, I am so sorry, I did not realize that, I have no idea how I wouldn't see that but I'm very sorry. She didnt know whether to think I was being manipulative or if I was just an idiot, which hurt but honestly she had every right to think that. 

She wanted me to let it go so I did. After class I apologized again because I still felt so horrible, I could not make sense of the situation and why I would do something like that. She basically just told me that based on what she was going through, this was the least of her worries. So I let it slide and was like okay, maybe it's not that big of a deal. 

That night we were on the phone for a couple hours, I brought it up because I wanted to mention to her my confusion, and I brought up what happened two weeks ago. I told her I could not understand why after her telling me there would be consequences if I did it in those areas the second time that I would do that, I reminded her of that previous event. I started to literally break down because I was questioning my own sanity and could not figure out what would cause me to do such a thing. I began to cry and she was not really having any of it, she believed that me breaking down was making me look more guilty. She also said that me doing it the second time was me trying to push her boundaries. I was literally unable to comprehend why I would do something like that to her even on accident. Regardless, we dropped the subject and moved on, we talked about other things and just said good night. 

The day after I was supposed to meet up with two friends to get dinner. We ate and one of them had to go. The other friend wanted to watch a movie with me and I was down. I invited my \[F19\] friend to come with us but she basically told me over the phone that it absolutely would not happen and that she needed space. I told her thats okay no worries, good night. 

I was absolutely restless and still could not understand why I would do something like that to her so I spent the rest of the weekend trying to figure it out or come to any sort of conclusion that made sense to me so I could explain it to her thinking it might provide some level of comfort (it absolutely did not and I messed up very very hard here for doing so). I had realized I switched my ADHD medication dose to something higher (my doctor was reluctant to do it but she eventually did give me a higher dose) just a month earlier. I called my doctor Monday morning and asked her if it was possible that my medication was causing me to hyper-fixate on an object/task harder than I should be and causing me to block out my surroundings. She said it was entirely possible and after hearing that I asked her to bring me back down in dosage. 

We did not talk on Sunday, and on Monday after our first class she signalled for me to come to her. She gave me the jacket back and she said it was because the association of having that jacket was making her uncomfortable. I took the jacket back and held onto it. Again though it seemed like a giant elephant in the room so I told her I think I may have an explanation as to why I might've done what I did. I explained to her what I talked to my doctor about but also made sure to tell her that my medication should be my responsibility and that I should have been more aware that this was happening, and I apologized again to her saying I should've realized sooner and it should not have gotten to a point where she was hurt by my actions. 

She basically called bullshit on me and told me there's no way a hyper fixation could explain that. I started getting emotional because I thought providing this information would give her some level of comfort but she dismissed it and before I started to cry again I basically walked away, she told me to come back and sit down but I refused because I was about to break down again and needed to be alone. After an hour when I had calmed down, I went back to her and we dropped the subject again and just talked about other things until our next class a couple hours later.

In class she was cracking jokes about the situation, she would put her fist out for a fist bump (its something dumb we do when either of us burps) and when I fist bumped her she was like um excuse me did I say you can touch me? She was obviously joking though and told me that, and we both just laughed about it. Then she made another joke in reference to how in her words ""I groped her tits"". I immediately stopped laughing. I said ""what do you mean groped your tits"". She said I used both my hands, and the palms of my hand (not the back of one hand) and grabbed them. I told her that for the last 4 days I have told her that I backhanded her jacket with one hand, and why she hadn't corrected me all the times I mentioned it until 4 days later. Back on Friday as I mentioned, she initially corrected me that I didnt backhand the middle of the jacket and I did it higher up on her boob, to which I took her word for it and said you know what, that must be right Im sorry I didnt know/realize I did that. 

When it came to her details about the two hands and using my palms I was in utter disbelief. I could not comprehend or remember it being that way. So this time I told her no, I did not do that, that is not how I remember it. I feel like I was very mean here though because I was invalidating her and she told me why would she lie about that with nothing to gain. I literally started to question my sanity again and took her word for it but by this point it was too late. I said okay you have no reason to lie to me, sorry for invalidating you, but you do realize that makes this infinitely worse and there is almost no way that would be an accident right?

By this point, me invalidating her perspective of two hands & the palms made her storm off when class was over, we got to the parking lot and went back and forth trying to make sense of the situation, I told her yet again I believe her and it must have happened like that. She was mad for several reasons which included her saying that my hyper-fixations were a justification. At the time I couldn't really make sense of it because I told her that I was responsible for my medication and actions and that it should have never happened. It didnt go anywhere, she held onto the fact that I was making justifications for it and I just agreed with her and said I was sorry again. She said she needed some time to now decide moving forward about what to do in terms of our friendship and it would take her a couple weeks.

Not to my surprise though the following night on Tuesday I got a call from her, I already knew what was happening here, she basically wanted to end things and told me that my actions on Monday was basically the cherry on top. After it was all over, she told me that me crying was a manipulation tactic for her to feel bad for me and that my story not making sense about the middle or top of the jacket was making me even more guilty. It was all over at this point. 

I think this is where I internally lost it but never said/showed it. I told her I cried because I felt terrible for the situation and if I wanted her to feel bad for me I wouldn't have stormed off when I got emotional and started crying. Furthermore she said again that my hyper fixation was a justification and made it sound okay what I did, I reiterated to her that I did not realize this and that I was telling her that it wasn't a justification, just a means to perhaps explain it all to provide some information besides ""I don't know why I did that"". Because even at that point I didnt even know if it could be the hyper fixation or not, ESPECIALLY with her added info about the two hands and palms. 

This is the most important part about everything that happened. Basically the last thing I mentioned about the entire situation (Just want to say we were no longer friends or ever going to be friends at this point, we agreed to that) since friday was I could not understand why my recollection of events was not the same as hers and why she did not bring up to me up until now that I did not use the back of my hand and one hand, but two hands and my palms. 

Her response absolutely baffled me. She has a history of dissociating and suppressing throughout her life, I already know this. She told me she might have been dissociating during what happened and that maybe thats why her details of the event were so different than mine, or my details are wrong. Regardless though she told me that my actions on Monday made her not want to be friends, and in terms of Friday, if I could at least admit that I hit her jacket, I said absolutely yes I did, there is no question that I did do that. At that point it hadn't fully registered to me so I just told her hey it could've been me who forgot too, I tend to forget a lot of things (but forgetting is not the same as remembering something differently) and that it could have been either of us. 

What didnt register to me is that before and after the jacket incident, she was having episodes of dissociation that week. (she even told me during class on Monday she was having one in class). 

Just want to be clear that none of the following has been addressed to her or ever will be because the last thing I want to do is tell her something I don't fully know, and besides the point we aren't talking anymore or even if I knew the truth, it would make her feel worse than she already does. At this point I feel so selfish for even making this post but all I want to do is make sense of all of this for myself and for my own sanity.

Again, I was wrong for ever depuffing the jacket, private parts or not, two hands, one hand, palm, backhand, it doesnt matter. I should've asked for permission or not done it at all. All I can wonder though and this makes me feel horrible to even question, but if she did dissociate during that incident, and she cant validate for sure if I used two hands and my palms, do I begin to question if I even touched her boob in the first place or I just hit the middle of the jacket like I initially thought? I made myself more guilty in the moment of it happening because I was so inclined to believe she was right about me hitting her boob and not the middle that I agreed without hesitation and switched up my story. 

I feel like the worst person in the world because now I feel like im victim blaming in my own head for even thinking that she might have been wrong about the details of the event due to the dissociation but I don't know what else to think because it is either that or I am literally the worst person in the world who violated the trust of someone I dearly care about and have now lost forever. I have been spiralling over the last day and don't even know what to feel anymore and I am literally questioning every part of my consciousness right now because I dont want to even trust myself at this point.  

TLDR; I was wrong because of an incident that occurred between my friend and I, that ended our friendship. But the details of that event are really messing with me because of our different recollections and I dont know what to believe because I know I messed up in terms of what happened, but those details are very concerning and I dont know what to think of myself anymore.",z36tpt,47,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z36tpt/an_incident_between_me_and_a_friend_ended_our/,relationships
6,I (31F) am stuck living with ex (32M) because he is blackmailing me,"I have been living with my ex boyfriend in low income housing for two years. I lost my job during the pandemic while I was pregnant and I was the breadwinner. We have two children together. I work part time and am in school. Everything is in my name and he is not on the lease. I decided that I didn't want him to be on the lease after having his background check completed because he not only can't keep a job for more than a week, but he treats me very badly. He's verbally, emotionally, and sexually abusive. I have called the police several times, but they never have enough evidence to make him leave the home. I called Fair Housing and the local municipal court to find out how to have him evicted legally. I told him verbally that he had 30 days to move, but at this point he is saying that if I try to kick him out he will go to the property manager and tell them he's been living here without being on the lease and will try to have me and our children evicted. I am in the process of getting back on my feet financially, but likely won't be able to afford to move out of housing for another year. I have no support system. No family and no close friends. I can't keep living with him, and I don't know what to do. He's awful, but I can't be homeless with my children. I thought about going to speak with the property manager myself, but I'm scared I'd be shooting myself in the foot.

7,"I (25 F) feel very distant from my parents (53F, 57M) and I don't share anything that goes in my life with them even though we live together.","My parents are good people, they have always treated me well but just as any other parents they're not perfect, and I think I've gone through emotional neglect as a child. Growing up I have always felt very distant from my parents, sometimes almost like I don't belong in the family. And my mom had always blamed me for us not having a close daughter and mother relationship.

The problem is that I'm 25 now but I still always feel very uncomfortable sharing anything with my parents, especially with my mom, even though I live with them. I limit myself to telling them only the very necessary things (like if I'm traveling abroad, only after having everything planned and set I would tell them a week before and make it seem like I have just decided to travel). 1 year ago I got a new job, I literally didn't tell them because I don't see a reason to? I just kept working and pretending it's the same job I was previously doing (I work remotely), and a few weeks ago, I lost my job, I also didn't share this with them. I'm just trying to make it trough it until I find a new job, and I'm spending a lot of time looking for jobs online so they wouldn't even notice. A few months ago I finished an online diploma that costed me a lot of money and effort, that they had no idea about. I've also got in and out of a relationship that they know nothing about.

Everytime something happens, I tell myself that I will be telling them about it later, but I just keep doing that until it's not important to share it with them anymore. And the thing is, I like sharing and asking for other people's opinions, I share with many of my friends and colleagues, but never with my parents.

This hurts because I know they're getting older and I don't have much time with them and that I should cherish our time together. But I don't know how to. This makes me feel guilty and it also makes me feel lonely sometimes to think that my parents who are sitting next to me don't know anything about what's going in my life or how I'm feeling. 

My sister is 10 years younger than me and I can tell that she's very comfortable to share many things with them and she has a very close relationship with my mom. My parents are also much more mature and understanding now. I feel like this could be resentment I have towards them but I feel almost pathetic that I still feel the same way I felt as a child when I'm an adult now. I also think they got used to me being like this, they believe I don't have much going on in my life and they also believe I don't like sharing much. 

Has anyone gone through this before? How can I work this out? 

TL;DR:
I'm extremely distant from my parents even though we live together, and it makes me feel guilty that I'm not cherishing my limited time with them but I just don't know how to change our relationship.",z2pbla,150,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z2pbla/i_25_f_feel_very_distant_from_my_parents_53f_57m/,relationships
8,Boyfriend wants to get married but doesn’t want a wedding,"Boyfriend doesn’t want a wedding because he thinks it will make his dad look bad

My (26f) boyfriend (27m) of four and a half years says he wants to marry me but doesn’t want a wedding. Background: we’ve been living together for two years and have an otherwise amazing relationship. He does not have a relationship with his dad (his only parent), but seems to want to establish one even though this man is pushing him away and keeps treating him with utter disrespect.

We’ve been talking about marriage and our timelines/plans practically since we started dating. We both initially wanted a big wedding after I was done with grad school (2021) but then we realized we weren’t in a rush to get married and obviously didn’t make any plans because of Covid-related restrictions. 

This year right after New Year’s he says 2022 would be a good year to get married. We talk about it briefly, and then I didn’t bring it up again because I was expecting a proposal.

By mid-April I realized there would be no way to have the wedding we had talked about in 2022. I bring it up and he says his relationship with his dad is making him feel depressed and he needs time to deal with his feelings. I let it go but remind him that if we do plan on having a wedding we need to at least set a date (I propose summer 2023) because many of our family members we’d want there live abroad and need plenty of time to make plans.

In July he drunkenly tells me that his dad disapproves of our relationship because he doesn’t like my family (he doesn’t know any of us directly), and that this has been weighing on him. I thought okay, he didn’t want to get married before sharing this with me and don’t think much of it.

Come September I finally bring it up and ask what’s happening. He tells me he wants to get married but doesn’t want a wedding.

He wants our closest people there but not his dad and he doesn’t feel comfortable having a huge wedding because people would talk about his dad being absent and even though they do not have a relationship he wants to protect him from the humiliation.

I believe he wants to marry me because he’s been trying to convince me to do a civil ceremony ASAP because we talked about starting a family and making big purchases (car, home). He is however adamant about not wanting a wedding.

Bear in mind we come from a culture (Eastern Europe) where huge weddings (300+) people are the norm and family is usually very involved.

I told him I would feel humiliated if he chose not to have the wedding we’ve been planning for over 3 years (and have told people about) because he is protective of his father’s feelings and public opinion over his absence, especially when this man doesn’t even know me and is against me.

I feel so disappointed and hurt that I am considering breaking up with him. Talking about the wedding so much has made me not even want one, ever, because it would feel forced.

I just want him to want to choose me over anyone.

Any perspective would be highly appreciated.

9,"I (28M)'m not sure if I love my gf(25F) but I'm also afraid of losing her, should I commit on this relationship?","More details about the situation:

I (28M)'m with my gf(25F) for more that 6 months now. She's foreigner and we met while she went working in my country, but she needed to leave 2 months ago and we succeded in meeting each other twice during this time despite the long distance (2 hours of flight + 1 to 3 hours of other transports). I can state at this point that she's very into me, she misses me a lot, but I cannot tell I feel the same for her... And I don't know exactly why... This is not how it was supposed to work.

It all started because (I just tell from my point of view, but of course relationships start from two people) I was single and this girl showed up in my life and just could not miss her: she's a good-looking woman, like nothing that drives me crazy or something but she's pretty. I think she's also very sweet and smart. Thing is I didn't think about the consequences, and did not expect her to take it so seriously from the very beginning, to the point she's far ""ahead"" compared to me. I'm not able to give back the same level of affection she gives to me, I started acting cold. It's strange: years ago I thought about this as the perfect life, like being in a serious relationship full of love, cuddles and everything, ready to share the life together... Now that it's happening I'm somehow scared.

On the other hand though, Im scared of losing her. She really seems to love me for who I am (but probably she doesn't know the ""whole"" me yet... Idk) And I spend a really good time with her so far... But fact is, I can carry on my life even without her close to me... and I feel I miss her only in few sporadic moments. Distance has shown me this clearly. I have to say I'm very inexperienced with relatioships: she's the first seriuos one but my whole life I had issues approaching women. I have self-esteem issues and suffered a lot because I felt women did not want me. I've always had this feeling that every girl who is slightly attractive is just out of my league, but also hoped that Im going to find the right one one day. So basically if I leave her, Im afraid that at age of 28 Im not going to find any other woman... I'm afrad being alone at some point of my life. However, after being single basically my whole life, I somehow learned to feel great alone, by myself. I like the freedom, I like checking out other women, I like staying with my friends and spending time with my hobbies. I'm also scared out by the idea of having children (for sure my gf would be much more ready for) because I became skeptical about the whole idea of family... Im afraid of putting in this world creatures that will suffer and I would feel responsible for them suffering... But again, Im afraid of ending up alone... And along with that, I don't want to hurt her feelings, she doesn't deserve that. I don't wat to break her heart.

Now, she makes a lot of pressure on me cause she wants me to find a job in her country (also because I know the launguage and have some relatives living there) she keeps saying she wants me so badly... But all of that is stressing as hell. Idk I did not imagine this being so difficult. I don't know if Im just lazy or if these are all signals she's not the right person for me. Im not going to tell further details so basically Im stucked in this situation where I don't know what to do. Please I need suggestions.

Thanks for having read so far, just wait for your wise advice.

10,Ongoing Problem with Stranger at Gym,"Hello, I'd really appreciate some advice about a situation that has been going on since early June 2022 (so nearly six months) involving me (32M) and this guy at my gym (33M). I know this might not seem like a big deal, but it has been really affecting me. I hate having problems with people (even when I'm not to blame) and I know it's a sensitivity of mine which I've tried to work through in counselling.

This is a small, friendly gym where a lot of people chat to each other, so it's definitely not unusual and I have quite a few gym buddies I give the nod to or make small talk with. I spoke to this guy one day (I dropped one of my earphones and he picked it up) and he was friendly. I then saw him a few days later and just said hi and how's it going. His reaction was odd. He made out that we'd never spoken before until I went to turn away and then he ""remembered"". I just let it go but didn't speak to him again.

This guy then started making what I can only describe as advances towards me. It started with him staring at me in a sexual way and following me around the gym. I thought it was all in my head at first, but it continued. He would never say anything. Just stare at me from afar and use the machine next to me or stand close to me. One time it was quite embarrassing, as I was with my trainer using a machine and he got a mat and started doing sit-ups very close to us. He literally walked across the gym to do this.

What really started to freak me out is if we happened to leave the gym together, I'd find him further up the road waiting on the corner playing on his phone. He would stand there until I walked past. It happened too many times to be coincidental. Also, one day he noticed I was behind him very far down the road and he suddenly stopped in the middle of this bridge and took a photo with his phone. I cannot prove it but I'm sure he took a picture of me, as he pointed his phone right in my direction.

The tipping point is that one day in the gym, he sat behind me while we were both using benches. I caught him looking at me in the mirror in a sexual way. I don't mind admitting I got freaked out and got up and moved to the other side of the gym. I wasn't used to getting attention in this way and I'd have felt equally uncomfortable if it was a woman.

Since that incident, his behaviour goes in two cycles. Cycle 1 is for a few weeks, he will avoid me in the gym but in an over-the-top way. If we're there at the same time, he will stay at the other side of the gym and either use a machine so he has his back to me or hide around the corner. If he has to walk past me, he will look down at his phone until he does. A few times, he has been coming into the gym when I'm leaving and he gets this frightened look on his face and dashes into the gym so that he doesn't have to walk past me.

Cycle 2 is he will turn up at the gym when I'm there (he knows the days and times I meet my trainer) and act completely different. He'll come right into the same area that I'm in and train normally. He doesn't act afraid or embarrassed at all and in fact, acts in a very confident manner and smiles to himself while playing on his phone. However, I'll catch him looking at me when he thinks I can't notice. These cycles have been alternating now for months.

I tried speaking this guy one day in an attempt to clear the air. However, he refused to speak to me and was actually very rude. He then messaged me on LinkedIn telling me off for trying to speak to him and how he felt uncomfortable. Even though I thought he was being ridiculous, I thought it would at least be the end of it, but he went back to the cycles 1 and 2 again. Only last week he was hiding from me in the gym and then this week he has turned up during two of my training sessions. At today's session, I had to walk past him at one point to get to the changing room and he looked down at his phone until we passed, but then I caught him looking back at me as I was leaving the gym.

I have reported this to the gym through my trainer and he's great and reassured me I've done nothing wrong and sticks to my side during our training. We meet twice a week and we try to vary the times of our training sessions, but it's difficult because of his schedule and my job. This guy always seems to turn up at least once a week during one of our sessions. Maybe it's me but it seems strange he would do that if he was genuinely scared of me.

I don't think this guy is dangerous, but I don't mind admitting I dread seeing him, as I don't know how he's going to act on any given day. The thing I find so disturbing is the way he can go from being embarrassed or scared of me to acting relatively ""normal"". I'm very hesitant to have any interactions with him, as when I replied to his strange LinkedIn message, I said I would not speak to him again at the gym or contact him online.

Any advice on how to deal with this situation would be much appreciated. I'm planning to move gyms when I finish my programme in spring, but it feels unfair I have to do that when I haven't done anything wrong. The only communication I've had with him is as follows:

1. Early June - he found one of my ear buds and I thanked him.
2. A few days later - I said hi to him and how's it going.
3. End of August - I ran into him coming out of our local grocery store. He said hi to me and smiled. I said hi back.
4. Early September - after (3) he went back to his previous behaviour and I tried to speak to him to clear the air. He sent me the LinkedIn message the same day.

TL; DR - a guy at my gym keeps acting strange towards me since I did not respond to what I think were sexual advances.",z2oa4d,120,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z2oa4d/ongoing_problem_with_stranger_at_gym/,relationships
11,Those of us spending Thanksgiving alone...,"

I (31F) do have my doggo, don't want to take him for granted. But it's another year where I just had to go and let people in my life that treated me dispensably. I have a lot to be thankful for, and I'm proud of myself for cutting them off, but I'm just sad to be wrapping up another year with no valentine, no birthday present, no person at the table to make feel special and who makes me feel special in return. My heart is aching, and I can't lie, I am jealous that the people I cut off will be surrounded with friends and family. Again, I'm happy I have the good old doggo to enjoy turkey with, he's the best boy, but it just sucks feeling otherwise so alone when you did your best to be a doting friend and lover to others.

Who's out there with me? Just thought if we lament together maybe we'll feel a drop less alone?

12,Am I (25F) having a “grass is greener” moment about my boyfriend (25M) or should we genuinely break up?,"Hi Reddit-
My boyfriend (25M) and I (25F) have been together 7 years and while I love him lots, I’ve been thinking that we maybe should break up. The main catalyst is that he’s been embracing a more feminine gender identity/expression. While I support this for him and want him to live his most authentic life, this has really lessened my physical attraction to him.


I’ve been spending lots of time recently longing for the opportunity to be physical with/date other men. My boyfriend is the only person I’ve ever slept with, and for the first time in our relationship, I’m starting to regret that. It doesn’t help that our sex life in our relationship has absolutely dropped off a cliff and now doesn’t exist.
Obviously every relationship slows down and has rough patches, especially after this many years. How do I know if these are issues to work on or signs that it’s time to move on? Reddit please help!

TLDR: I keep thinking about dating/fucking other men after my boyfriend changed his personal appearance and I don’t know if this is normal relationship phase or a sign of something bigger",z3bua6,5,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z3bua6/am_i_25f_having_a_grass_is_greener_moment_about/,relationships
13,"I’ve never felt so alone, is it time to give up?","Possible TW for mention of baby loss.



I (23f) have been with my fiancé (25m) for a little over 2 years now. It’s been an eventful relationship to say the least. We’ve both hurt each other, our families don’t get along, we lost a baby, we moved and we’ve been through a lot. I cheated on him 8 months into the relationship but I went to therapy and I got help, I’ve been loyal ever since and plan to stay loyal for the rest of my life. I learned from the mistakes I made and I’ve been working hard to be the best person I can be. We worked things out and stayed together after said affair. 

We got engaged 2 months later at 10 months in. A few month after getting engaged he told me he didn’t actually want to be engaged to me and it was hurting him to call me his fiancée. He felt rushed/pressured into proposing because he was afraid to lose me. I wasn’t going anywhere so that hurt to hear, but just as quickly as he said it he took it back and now tells me he never meant that. 

Fast forward to 1 year and 1 month into the relationship he catches feelings for his coworker, talks horribly of me to his family and almost leaves me for said coworker. He got an apartment behind my back and abandoned me out of nowhere. Essentially he emotionally cheated (not physically as far as I know). I still have all the screenshots, yet he denies liking her. His family hates me because of the things he said about me out of anger and I haven’t been able to get along with them since. It’s not the first time he’s abandoned me, but I’m used to it at this point. 

Skipping ahead to April of this year, I found out I was pregnant. I was super excited since I was told I’d likely be infertile at 16 years old. He seemed excited (later found out he was not) and he was very present for the pregnancy. Unfortunately we lost the baby at 21w and I feel like our relationship has just gotten worse since. Men and women grieve differently, but he let it slip he was relieved she died. 

Now here we are, kicked out of our old apartment for making too much money, just moved into our new much more expensive apartment and I’ve never felt so disconnected from him. I’ve never felt so lonely. So unloved. So unworthy of being loved and respected. I love him, he says he loves me…but if I take an honest look deep inside myself I know I likely won’t be marrying this man. I fear if I do I’ll just be miserable for the rest of my life. What do I do? 

Do we try to recover from all the bad times and fix things? Do we try therapy and try to reconnect with each other? Do we try to get that honeymoon phase of our relationship back? 

Or

Do we give up? Do we admit this this relationship is barely a relationship anymore? Do we call it quits and move on? Advice please? What do we do?

TL:DR- The love *seems* to be gone, we’ve been through so much and it feels like there’s miles between us. We still say we love each other, we still say we want a future with each other, but I honestly don’t know if I see a future.

14,My boyfriend told me he'd break up with me if I were bisexual.,"TL;DR My bf of 4 years said he would break up with me if I told him I'm bi after making jokes about me being secretly in the closet and wanting to leave him for years. I never told him I actually might be because he has relationship anxiety.

&#x200B;

My (25F) boyfriend (25M) have been together for over 4 years and a few weeks ago he said something which didn't sit right with me but I don't know if I am exagarrating.

I think I clocked that I could be attracted to women shortly before we got together, but because we started dating I didn't have the need or desire to explore that part of myself further. I fell in love with him and pushed any internal questions about my sexuality aside. It didn't matter to me, only he did. Over the course of our relationship, he's been making jokes about me being secretly in the closet or gay and in denial because of stupid shit like me occasionaly wearing birkenstocks and overalls, and accompanying my friend to a gay club once. He would always say that women must be hitting on me all the time and that one day I would realise I'm gay and leave him.

At first I thought he was just joking but then realised he's probably feeling a bit insecure in the relationship so I tried to reassure him as best as I could that I love him, I am attracted to him and nothing is going to change that. But he never stopped joking about me being gay despite me saying it made me uncomfortable when he made jokes like that. We never discussed the topic in depth because I didn't want to make his insecurity even worse by admitting that I find women attractive too.

Cut to a few weeks ago when we were out drinking with out friends. Our conversation was wide and the topic of attraction and sexuality came up (the friends we were with are both bi). I didn't contribute much to the conversation because I didn't want to say something which might make his insecurity about me leaving him worse. But then he made another joke about me being secretly gay or bi and something in me snapped and I asked ""so what if I were?"" and he said that he would break up with me. I asked if he would find dating a bisexual person an issue and he said that no, it would only be an issue if I told him now because it would be ""a new, crucial piece of information"". I asked if he would have an issue dating me if he had known that I was bi when we first met and he said no, he wouldn't have a problem with that, probably. We awkwardly changed the topic and haven't discussed it since but it left me feeling very weird.

Obviously I understand it would be weird if suddenly after 4 years of our relationship I came out as bi because it would look I met someone who made me realise I might be (which is why I never planned on doing it, especially taking his insecurity and anxiety into consideration) but something about what he said left me feeling uneasy.

Am I reading too much into this? How can I help ease his relationship anxiety, particularly around this topic?",z36dsk,10,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z36dsk/my_boyfriend_told_me_hed_break_up_with_me_if_i/,relationships
15,My (M22) platonic female friend (f22) wants to go on a vacation with just us.,"TLDR: female friend wants to go on vacation with just us 2 but I’m worried it might be awkward. 


I have a platonic female friend I’ve known since high school. We were/are pretty close, although she moved states after highschool so we don’t talk as much now. 

While in HS, There was a point I liked her, and she gently let me down, which I was okay with, because I still enjoy her company.

We have both since dated other people, she got into a LTR, I’ve been dating around. 

However she recently called me saying that her and her bf broke up. 

 After consoling her, she asked if she wants to go on a vacation, just the 2 of us, to get away from everything. 

Now while I do love this girl to death…just the 2 of us on vacation?? Lmao it seems real relationshipy. We usually hang out one on one but this just seems too intimate. Plus she JUST got out of a LTR. 

I told her I would think about it. Not sure if I should go or not. I feel like it would be awkward but at the same time who says to friends can’t just enjoy a vacation together?

16,Would you ever get back together with someone who briefly left you for someone else? [27M and 25F],"TL;DR: If you date someone for two weeks, they leave you for someone else, then wanna get back together and you do - would you feel insecure months later still?

Met my gf, and we dated two weeks (fairly casual, we didn't claim to be bf/gf). She then said she still had feelings for the guy she was with before me so she shouldn’t keep seeing me.

A week later she says she’s done with him. We get back together.

Eventually, she tells me what happened - he was an impulsive, predatory manipulative asshole the whole time they dated, but she was in a really miserable self-hating place (just got out of a bad 3 year LTR with a different guy) so she left me for him because she felt like she ""deserved"" someone shitty. He also told her he was neglected and abandoned as a kid and so he made her feel super guilty for leaving him, and she also had childhood trauma so she had some compassion for him, whereas she knew I've had a very easy life.

4 months have passed and I do love her, but I still feel insecure for some reason even though she has tried her best to reassure me. But still, alll he had to do was be nice to her that week, and she'd be with him instead of me. 

I hear it's a thing that self-hating people will not feel like they deserve good people. Am I being dumb? We weren't exclusive yet and we only dated two weeks before she left me originally. Should I just be happy?


Here is what she said:

""You aren’t even in the same category as X. He was a predator who manipulated me with lovebombing from date 1. I was horribly vulnerable and he preyed on that. He had zero boundaries and had this cycle of ghosting and showing affection that just fucked up my head. It wasn’t even affection, it was guilt and believing I deserve to feel like shit and I’ll fuck up someone good and normal. And he preyed on my compassion by sharing his tragic backstory right off the bat. He was harmful and my friends, coworkers and therapist saw me falling apart. I thank god I met you because I saw normalcy. And yes I was pathetic and went back because I had an addiction to the drama. I was weak and I wish hadn’t been.""",z31wok,16,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z31wok/would_you_ever_get_back_together_with_someone_who/,relationships
17,I (31F) am upset with my (34M) husband for ruining my confidence.,"
This is a long one, brace yourselves.. and please be kind.. this may not seem like a big deal but this is really affecting me. 


My husband and I have been together for 12 years. I don’t want to make it sound like I’m a sex addict, but when we first started dating I was 19 and he was 23 and I had a very high sex drive that he couldn’t keep up with. When we did have sex it was amazing, but he frequently rejected my advances and it put a HUGE strain on our relationship and my confidence. Due to the repeated rejection, I stopped initiating and used my frustration to reframe my views about sex and learned to accept different gestures, such as cuddling/flirting, as affection. 

Over the course of many years, our sex life improved. Unfortunately, while I was pregnant with our first child, sex became very painful and my libido disappeared. My husband was fine with this, most likely because of his own low libido.

I gave birth to our son a year ago and even though I had a c-section, PIV sex was still very painful. My husband has been so patient with “warming me up” and making sure I’m comfortable. I’ve struggled with body issues for as long as I can remember and for a while, our biggest obstacle has been my self esteem. It’s been hard for me to reach orgasm because all I can focus on is, “ is he looking at my stomach, can he see my stretch marks?” I used to be in good shape and was proud of my body. Now, I have 10-15 lbs of baby weight to lose and I’m really struggling with the stretch marks on my belly and the loose skin by my c-section scar. 

Bottom line, I’ve never felt uglier and more uncomfortable in my own skin. He’s very aware of my struggles and was doing an amazing job comforting me and helping me adjust to my new body..

The other day I was on Pinterest on his iPad and accidentally stumbled upon the tune my feed feature and discovered tons of views of half naked fitness models. I immediately felt a pit in my stomach and became very sad. For some reason I internalized this feeling as a deep sense of rejection. Apparently, I wanted to make myself feel even worse, because then I searched his history and found that he has been watching porn. I went from feeling upset and disappointed to extremely angry.. 

I was finally loosening up and starting to accept my new body. I was starting to feel sexy in front of him and not embarrassed.. that is now gone. 

To a lot of people this rant may come off as stupid or immature but as someone who has always struggled with body issues; it makes me so upset that he’s thinking about fitness models but then having to have sex with me. I’m so sad because I feel like I was just starting to get comfortable in the bedroom again. I’m mad because my libido is coming back and I’m too embarrassed to have sex with him- nor do I want to. I’m angry because he’s choosing right now to start checking out other women. And I’m angry because all he had to say was that he is so sorry that I lost the confidence we both worked so hard to bring back. 

I’ve been kind of cold towards him the past few days (not affectionate or as playful ) but he’s not doing anything to help this situation or rebuild trust.

18,Girlfriend won't travel with me because of her parents,"My (29m) girlfriend (26f) have been dating for 1.5 years. She has a strong relationship with her parents, which is something great to have in life. However, through our relationship so far, she has always asked her parents for permission to do things such as travel with me, attending a party, etc. Most of the time she just lets them know what she is doing, which is fine, but the traveling permission specifically irks me.

Her parents are very traditional and religious, and she is too, but less traditional because of our generation. I've respected her decision to refrain from premarital sex due to religious reasons, and we still sleep together (secretly, unknowingly from her parents). With that said, I've been wanting to travel abroad with her ever since we got together, but she said that she wants to wait until marriage because her parents wouldn't allow us to until then (mostly because of sleeping together in the same bed). The fact that we also need to hide that we stay together has been bothering me, because we are grown adults; she just doesn't seem to agree the same way. She has promised that once we get married, everything will be ok, I trust her wholeheartedly but still have doubts in the back of my mind.

We got into an argument about traveling to Europe, and I let it slip out that I thought her relationship with her parents is unhealthy, and she got upset because she said she loves her parents and wants to do everything right. She is the one making the decision to not want to travel with me because she knows her parents would disapprove - on top of that, she isn't upset with that mindset either. She wholeheartedly treasures her parents and is happy to be this way. I, on the other hand, don't have as close as a relationship with my parents, but maybe as a guy, I've grown independent from my parents and don't really let them know about what I'm doing day to day. I'd definitely just let them know if I was traveling for a few weeks though, just so they know what I'm up to once in a while.

I don't like fighting with her about this, and we do really get along, but it feels like there's a mental barrier. I really want us to work out in the end.

tl;dr

19,I (26F) don’t want to do Thanksgiving at my mom’s (50sF),"I know the title sounds horrible but I really need some advice. 

Since my dad’s passing about a year and a half ago, my mom’s been dating. Good for her, I don’t care or mind that she’s dating, but she’s bringing her new boyfriend to Thanksgiving and given her break up with her last boyfriend, it’s giving me misgivings.

With this ex, it took me a while to warm up to the idea that she was dating again (it was still less than a year since my dad’s passing and I was still mourning) but I was really trying and he was really trying to get me to accept him. At first my mom was trying to get the three of us to hang out more, and I admittedly would act a little quiet because I was still uncomfortable with the situation. 

One day I decided since it had been a number of months and it seemed like he wasn’t going anywhere to try to get to know him a bit better; it seemed like he might potentially join the family since they were getting serious so I decided to try to get to know him better. The three of us went to dinner and it turned out he and I had a lot of common interests that he and I were passionate about! It was a good conversation but I looked over and my mom was glaring at me. I was confused and asked what was wrong.  She said “maybe I should let you two be”.  He looked just as confused as I was.After he left to go home, she asked me if I had daddy issues or something. 

He was so disgusted by what she said he dumped her and she tells me to this day she was joking and we were both being sensitive. I’ve not wanted to meet any of the guys she’s dated since. I just don’t want something like that to ever happen again. 

She’s invited her new boyfriend to thanksgiving and honestly it’s making me so anxious I feel like throwing up just thinking about it. I want to spend thanksgiving with my family but I just don’t want even the potential to be in that situation again.

20,How do I stop comparing myself to my significant other & friends?,"Me: 19m, others: 19f/m  
I've been dealing with some low self esteem for the past year or so. I wouldn't say its crippling, but sometimes its pretty bad, sometimes its almost non-existent.

Growing up, I typically got better grades than a lot of my friends, and that's where a majority of my self-confidence came from. I knew that I, although nothing crazy, was smart, and that's what I took pride in. It was like no matter what else I may be flawed in, I've got that going for me, and that's what kept me happy.

I am now a sophomore in college and have found myself not able to rely on this as much anymore. I have multiple friends who have better work ethics than I do, and often time get better grades than I do. I love my friends dearly, and academic success is the last thing I look for in a friend, but I've begun comparing myself to these people and am feeling as if I am nothing special. It's like my one security isn't all that significant anymore, and I don't feel like I'm all that worthy of a person.

I met my now-girlfriend last semester, and I love her very dearly. Again, not that it matters, but she is smarter than me, has a crazy good work-ethic, and is overall a role model of a person. Because of my self esteem issues, I often times compare myself to her, and see her doing lots of productive things. I don't think I'm a lazy person nor am I not doing enough as an adult, but I almost feel less-lovable if I can't quite compete with what she is doing. It isn't a jealousy thing, its just a self confidence thing, I guess. I've brought it up minorly with her on a few occasions, and she has always assured me that I am enough and that she cares about me, and I believe in her, but a lot of the times the intrusive thoughts win and I just feel like I'm not enough, among other things.

Without elaborating further in order to not write a full on novel, is there any advice on how I can stop comparing myself to my significant other, along with my friends in general?

tl;dr : My self esteem is low and I keep comparing myself to my loved ones.

21,"My boyfriend just wants to chill, and I'm losing my mind","

My boyfriend (28 m) and I (31 f) haven been together for 2.5 years. We moved in together in August and I'm having a nervous breakdown.

I have struggled with addiction and a loss in the past  and (at least partly) due to that, I'm very focused on my mental health, having hobbies, reading, going to therapy, keeping a schedule, etc. My boyfriend has helped me through a lot and I love him dearly.

However, since moving in together the dynamic in our relationship has changed a lot. I began to notice, as I dramatically shifted to a motivated homemaker and working on myself, that he has become more and more.. Lifeless? 

He has no hobbies, except for video games, but as we have no PC, he can't do that. So whenever he has free time that I don't ""force"" him to do something else, he keeps scrolling the Internet and watching TV. Nothing else.

I'm starting to feel like everything he does outside of that is because I make him. Like grocery shopping (""we can just whatever, we don't have to put so much work into it"" ) to cleaning (""it's not a life or death thing"") to cooking (he'd cook, but only instant soup) to.. Everything.

I find myself working towards a future family, always learning something, cooking new things, cleaning, organising everything (appointments, repairs, everything). While he just goes along, but it's like I'm dragging him into all of this. Like he just wants to watch TV all day.

I've tried talking to him about it, but he just says he's overwhelmed. But I'm doing 3/4 of the chores and work full time (as does he). I've tried to get him to go to therapy, but if he doesn't want it, it won't help. He can't even say what about the 3 chores per week he does is overwhelming.

I want to be cooler about it, like not care so much what he does with his life. Its his life. I don't want to drag him along all the time.

How can I let go of this need to manage him?

Tldr: boyfriend only wants to watch TV and is overwhelmed, I feel like I'm dragging him into this family-life that he doesn't want and I just want to be less stressed about it all.",z310ft,15,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z310ft/my_boyfriend_just_wants_to_chill_and_im_losing_my/,relationships
22,"Me (21M) and my girlfriend (22F) broke up last month, we promised to stay friends, but..."," PS: Sorry if I screw up with the english

Me (21M) and my girlfriend (22F) broke up last month, but it was kind of a nice way to end the things between us, at least at first. We've been together for 3 years, it was a nice relationship with some little fights that never made us hate each other in the end. The idea of breaking up came from her.

So, I'm not going to dive into all of the details that lead us to the ending, but **we promised to stay friends**. She was really concerned that I would feel regretful for meeting her, and I promised that it would never happen.

She said that I was her best friend, and I also felt the same way with her. So in the last month we've been talking normally to each other like we used to do. During our relationship, we would always send each others cute and funny animals videos/images and chat a little bit online. It stayed that way after we broke up.

**Little detail here: I was in a really bad luck, I was trying to be optimistic about the whole situation, even though I was sad. Before we broke up, I addopted a little kitten, and it died one week after we broke up**.

Of course that made me really depressed, I cried a lot and couldn't find a way to stop thinking about it. But again, my former girlfriend (that became my new best friend) was there to support me. When my kitty died, she was the first person that I tried to call when I was in despair, I know it kinda sucks and I really wish it wasn't this way, but I really needed her help back then.

So, we had some minor arguings since we broke up, but I don't think that's relevant since we were totally fine after that fights.

But then. 1\~2 week(s) ago I guess, we went out together to have some icecream. We kept talking about our ""new lifes"" as singles and that was really fine, we joked and laughed a lot. We bought each other's some gifts since it was close to ours birthdays. I had her gift in my house and was planning to give to her another day. But she insisted that we should went there to take it.

So... in the night before I had a girl invited there to my place, we drinked, watched stuff and you know the rest... I'm not proud of it, I really think I rushed things of a little bit. I should have given myself more time, but the opportunity was there and I was scared to miss it out.

In my head I had two options: to admit what happened or to hide it away, but if I chose the second one, I was worried that she would think that I was drinking alone, kinda of a depressed thing. So I had to choose: risk to look like an asshole flexing for what happened or to worry her with my mental state. I chose the first one.

And she was fine with that, really. We were already kind of playing with this situations that would happen one time or another.

But, coming to the present again: a few days ago she just stopped sending me texts. And when I send to her, I just feels like she's not interested in talking to me. In twitter, she started just to give reactions to the ""cute animal stuff that we always used to send each other"", but never replying or sending me anything back.

I can easily sense that something feels strange, I overthink stuff a little bit sometimes, but I've stopped trying to start conversations with her and... surprise! She's literally never sending me any stuff.

I don't know if I hurt her by telling what I did, but I only told her 'cause I thought it would be okay and that she would already have done the same thing.

I'm not sure if that was what made her started to act different with me. But I also think that she's already seeing someone else and talking to me now just feels awkward to her.

Anyway, that's all. I afraid that I'm feeling a little anxious and depressed about it. I don't want to get back with her, but I really thought that we would still be friends after everything. I'm really upset about it... I miss talking to her, but I don't want to throw my pride away and start bothering her when she's not going to look for me.

I'm afraid that I've gotten emotional dependent on her, and that's why I feel this need to keep her as a friend. Or maybe is because we will always be seing each other sometimes, since we share almost the same friends. Or my expectations were broke, 'cause I always saw her as the best person and the one that cared the most about me, she did some promises and said stuff that made me feel so much better recently, but now she's different with me.

Sorry for the vent, I would really like if any of you had any advice for me. Should I let this person, that I really care for, just go?

As I said previously: *""She was really concerned that I would feel regretful for meeting her, and I promised that it would never happen."".* Well, maybe it will...

 

    **TL;DR; : My ex-girlfriend broke up with me last month. We promised to stay friends and we kept it going for a while, everything was fine, but she started to act different with me a week ago. I don't know if it is 'cause she's seeing someone else or if it was something that I said.**.",z3688w,9,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z3688w/me_21m_and_my_girlfriend_22f_broke_up_last_month/,relationships

I understand we have a slightly different taste, and that’s ok, we all different but he suddenly sarcastically said: 

“oh maybe your taste in anime is the same as your shopping taste. Guess that makes sense when youre born without functioning eyeballs :/ Cant blame you for being blind. The world is unfair, life is unfair. Some people are blessed with power of sight”

I called him out from being rude with his comment and he didn’t even apologize or say anything back. 

I don’t know if i was overreacting. This is not the first time he made comments like that. There were different occasion that i told him he’s been mean with his comment. But he just brush it off. 

P.S We agree just to be casual. I still think even in casual relationship we deserve mutual respect.

TL;DR : i was talking to the guy i’ve been seeing for 7 months and we were talking about anime and tv shows to watch together and he sarcastically said a hurtful comment because we have different taste.

24,My girlfriend is too overwhelmed with mental health issues to be there for me after 6 months of dating. What should I do?,"I (20F) am dating my girlfriend (23N) for about 6 months (they use they/them pronouns but prefer to be referred to as “girlfriend”). We’re both in situations where our mental health issues have kept us from the normal things people are age are doing (graduating high school, starting college, driving, having a job, being independent). So we came together in a relationship as we were both looking to be less alone in all of this.
I don’t have any friends outside of them or access to mental health care even though i want both those things very much. My parents do not love themselves enough to love me or take care of me and my brother. But i work really hard to stay as healthy as i can and work towards getting better and finally starting life with everyone else. They, my girlfriend, have one friend outside of me who is away at college right now. They also have access to mental health treatment. They see a professional at least 3 times a week and are able to message them outside of sessions too. Their mom is also very supportive of them and their healing. As i said, we’ve dated for about 6 months and for a while it was such a respite from the isolation i was in before. They were interesting and cool and i didn’t mind their limitations because i have limitations of my own. But now, it feels like all we ever talk about is how much life sucks or how bad things are going or the problems we have. No more conversations about art or music or books or movies. Which in itself is not a good sign, I know, and I have expressed this to them. We’re trying to talk about those things again.
They have expressed that they feel really appreciative when I’m there for them and that i do a good job. But, when i come to them with issues, it feels as if they cannot comprehend how to be a supportive person. Then when i express to them that i don’t feel supported by them and tell them what i need in terms of support, they get SO upset and talk about how they’re so awful at being there for me and such a bad girlfriend and they’re trying but they can’t do anything right. So then i end up having to support them and reassure them when i was the one who needed support in that moment and my needs are forgotten about. Some days, they won’t even text me at all because they’re dealing with their mental health issues and don’t have the time or space for me. Of course i want them to prioritize themselves and tend to their mental health, but i also need them to show up for me as a partner. I feel as if I’m always there for them and they are never there for me. Which i feel frustrated about sometimes because they have access to much more help and resources than me and still can’t show up for me yet i don’t have access to any resources or friends and am still there for them almost every time! I keep trying to talk to them about this, and they say they want to be there for me better, but it never happens. We’re having a chat about it tomorrow to try to work it out more.
I don’t have anyone else in my life and i’m scared of being alone after about 5 years of not having friends due to the health issues i am dealing with keeping me stuck in my home. So breaking up with them is so so scary. I’m worried they don’t have the space to be a girlfriend while they’re in this intense season of healing though. I’m unsure if I should stay with them and keep trying to work with them about having more balance and support between us even though it hurts. Maybe at least until I figure out how to find people in my life who can actually support me. I don’t even know how i would go about making friends so i’m not all alone anymore. The other option would be to break up with them already and deal with the hurt of isolation again and try to find people to be in my life. I greatly appreciate suggestions on how can i find people to be friends with if I’m not in school and can’t drive. Because this is isolation, not solitude. I love solitude and can revel in it. But isolation is hell. Thank you for your thoughts.

25,Toxic situation in my family that’s degrading,"Idk where to start. I’ll provide some background:

The root of the problem is my mom’s side of the family. My grandmother favors my mom’s sister so much more than my mom and they basically walk all over my mom. They don’t respect her and they do whatever they want. For example, my grandma purchased a huge expensive home and had my aunt (my moms sister) live in it for free for 12 years. They saved up enough money to even buy a whole house of their own in cash and my grandma STILL gave them more money. My grandma withheld my mom’s fathers (my Grandpa’s) life insurance money as well even though she was supposed to get money from it. My Aunt and my Grandma team up against my mom and take advantage without giving much back in return.

My dad is an extremely hard worker. He works long and hard. It kills him that we get the short end of the stick while my aunt’s family lives in such luxury literally due to my Grandma. My mom however doesn’t care. She lets them walk all over her, and us, and often even takes their side over my dad’s. So they’ll come over, eat all of our food, and leave, while my dad slaves away all day every holiday. Then the next week my aunt and my grandma make some sort of secret financial deal behind my mom’s back. It’s a super toxic situation. My mom defends them in the end which makes things terribly worse

The problem is, my dad is fed up with it. He’s tired of it, and quite frankly, so am I. We are honest hard working people and we don’t deserve it.

Long story short, we had a huge blowout tonight.

Originally they were going to come over for thanksgiving, then they cancelled on us. So my dad said ok, I’ll make enough for just my family then. Then, out of nowhere my mom says that they’re coming over after we did all the shopping. My dad gets pissed off and says that that’s ridiculous. My mom gets defensive back and tries to make my dad out to be a fool. My dad, clearly angry, says that it’s ridiculous that they have the ability to just override our plans and my mom lets them.

I get fed up and I tell my mom that it is absolutely ridiculous that we don’t even have enough food for everybody right now. My mom snaps back at me and it just turned into an explosion. Then my dad told my dad something hurtful that was way out of line. Basically, we’re going out of state to visit my dad’s brother. My dad hasn’t seen him since the death of their other brother 15 years ago which was traumatic. My mom says “well you’ll go all the way there to visit your brother yet have an issue with having my sister over”. Like what the fuck? Is it just me, or is there a major disconnection going on. She’s comparing my dad’s brother to my manipulative aunt like that? Delicate situation too, they haven’t seen each other since their other brothers death. I felt that was super fucked up. Then she says how “I’m all alone I want my sister around” like..sigh. God forbid they just casually hangout and do something but there always has to be something in it for my aunt it seems like for them to hangout. Again, my mom doesn’t give a shit. 

tl;dr I just walked away from the argument. I feel disgusted quite frankly. I’ve given my family thousands of dollars to help out and my dad slaves away all day so my mom makes us out to be a piece of shit because we’re tired of being taken advantage of by her nutty family.

26,Financial Commitment Question,"Hey guys, 

I (39m) and my gf (42f) keep running into quite a big issue and I’m not sure how to handle it.

We are both separated from long term relationships which involved children and houses. 

We both got damaged in the separation, me financially but keeping the house, her financially AND losing the house.

As a result of the divorce, my expenses and costs are significantly higher than before, pushing me to my limit financially. I do however earn a good amount. 

My girlfriend by contrast has a lump sum in the bank but no job and no job prospects. The child support payments don’t even cover the school fee obligations. 

I am 100% totally committed to her, and she lives without any cost in my house. However, she continually says that I’m not committing to her enough and that financially it doesn’t work for her. I literally don’t have any bandwidth to give more, but I pay for almost every meal out etc. I am committed to the point I am trying to have a child with her. 

Given what we’ve both been through, effectively both losing half a house, I’m not in a place where it even seems logical to me to ‘give’ someone half of my house, or to marry. She says this is me being scarred and threatens to leave over it.

Not only is there this ‘lack of commitment’ issue, there’s also the issue of the location of my house, which isn’t as convenient for her as her old house. It’s also significantly larger and more luxurious. She argues she doesn’t need any of that and it takes her time to maintain it (we both maintain it but she doesn’t register the things I do). She also says she hates living in that location. For various reasons which I won’t get into, it’s not yet possible to sell or rent the house out. And I’m not entirely sure I’d want to do either as it’s a home I designed and built.

I feel like with both of these issues I’m totally trapped, unable to change anything significant, yet they continue to be not just sources of tension - but topics of arguments which escalate and escalate to her threatening to leave. Typically the financial issue is the larger one, but the location issue is creating a general sense of ‘unhappiness’ with her. For reference, financially she would spend 2/3x more per month than she is now if she got her own place, to the point her money would last 2-3 years. 

I have tried, desperately, to articulate that neither of these issues is under my control, to no avail. 

How do we move forward given our respective situations and the difficulties? These two issues alone have already caused more arguments than most couples have in a lifetime, and I am desperate for a way to approach this.

TL/DR - My girlfriend demands commitment I feel I’m already giving her and a financial situation I can’t stretch to. How do I resolve this?",z2yxp2,17,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z2yxp2/financial_commitment_question/,relationships
27,A gaslighter?,"So. I'm really in need for some outside perspective right now and I don't have anywhere else to go. 

I (35F) moved in with my partner (42 M) almost 4 years ago, in a city 800km from my hometown. I lost contact with most of my friends except two of them, with whom I still talk daily. They both hate my partner, but since they have never even met him in person, I believe they probably have a distorted judgement based on the fact that I tend to talk more about the relationship when it goes sour.

My partner is very loving, calm, good-hearted, the very opposite of violent (I couldn't imagine him even cursing at me), among many other qualities like smart, cute etc. We have a best friend's intimacy, like ""fart and laugh"" kind of relationship and sometimes this excessive intimacy leads us to make fun of each other in harsh (borderline offensive) ways. 

Lately, however, I have been noticing he is getting very critical of me. Each and every little thing I do he finds something wrong with it. My interaction with him is 90% me explaining myself, why did I do the way I did something and proving there wasn't a more practical/smart/rational way to have done it. I addressed this issue to him many times, but he always acts like I'm talking nonsense, that he doesn't do that at all (either deny or says he was joking). So I started pointing out every single time it happens, and since it's literally all day, it became overtly obvious that he indeed does that. Still he wouldn't acknowledge it. And that's when the whole thing began to kind of frighten me. The more obvious the whole dynamic became since I started pointing out every time, the more he began to appear more and more distressed and his justitifications more and more out of place, like gaslighting or something. 

So today something happened that made me question so deeply my own reality that either he is undoubtedly gaslighting the heck out of me or I really should seek psychological help. Since I know my two only friends happen to hate him, I don't think they are in a position to offer me a clear outside perspective, so I'm really hoping you guys can. But please, if you think he is right and I'm wrong, do tell me. Don't just automatically take my side, ok? 

So this is what happened: today I went with him to a doctor's appointment (I always go with him bc he prefers so). The secretary called, he entered the doctor's office and I followed behind. We sat and the doctor asked him:

Doctor: Uh, do you know this woman?

Me (chuckles): Oh, no I'm just a curious stranger...

Partner: Yes, she's with me.

Doctor: Are you two blood related?

Me (starting to realize doc wasn't joking at first): No, I'm his... partner.

Doctor: Oh, ok, I just didn't think so. 

Me (confused): Ok...

Doctor: Are you going to have an appointment as well?

Me: No, I just came to accompany him. I can leave if that's a problem.

Doctor: No, it's ok, it's just that I saw the next patient was a woman and I thought it could be you.

Me: No, I'm here just with him.

Doctor: Ok. 

(So the appointment went on)

When we left, we passed by a snack bar on our way to the car and I searched the menu for something gluten-free. 

Partner: there is tapioca.

Me (looking at the menu): I don't see it. 

Partner: Look over there (pointing at the counter)

Me (looking at the counter): Where?

Partner: THERE! 

Me: I honestly don't see it, where?!

Partner: My goodness...

Me: Ah, I see it! Ok. Cool. 

(We eat and leave) 

In the car:

Partner: How in the world you didn't see the damn tapioca, ""lol"".

Me: I just didn't. It was behind a reflection on the glass. Look! Here you are again, criticizing me! One more! 

Partner: I'm not criticizing you, I just though it was weird. That's all.

Me: Why bring that up again? It took me some time to see it. What's so weird about that?

Partner: Nothing.

Me: No, please, do tell me what your intention was in bringing back my inability of spotting the tapioca at the counter.

Partner: No intention at all.

Me: All communication has intention. 

We talk of other things. At some point, I talk about the weird misunderstood with the doctor and how uncomfortable it was. He says the doctor was joking. The whole time. 

Me: Joking?!

Partner: Of course! You could argue he wasn't the best comedian of all time, but he was trying to make some humor. 

Me: No, he wasn't even smiling, he seemed serious all the time. He even said he thought I might be the next patient, which was a woman.

Partner: Yeah, THAT was also a JOKE.

&#x200B;

The discussion goes on and partner says this: ""You know what, I think I know what is really going on here: you probably have asperger's and can't perceive social cues, that's why you always mistake people's intentions and can't take jokes"". 

That's it. That's his theory. At first I was like ""Whaaat? Asperger?! What the hell are you talking about??""

But then we arrived home, I came to my room and started questioning myself: what if I am aspie? What if I can't read peoples intentions? I mean, I do have ADHD and they are commonly comorbid... 

I honestly feel something about him is off, but at the same time the whole idea of him gaslighting me doesn't make any sense. Why would he abuse me? Why would he want to harm me that way, inventing something like that? I feel dizzy. Am I paranoid? Am I aspergers? Is he a mean spirited person? All this time? All the love we shared was fake? Why would he want to harm me? Why make me feel like my perception is wrong? Was the doctor joking? What kind of joke is that?

&#x200B;

Sorry for the long post and the lack of cohesive thinking. I'm mind streaming since I'm nervous and confused. If he is an abuser, I have to move out, separate, what am I going to do? I'm at lost. 

I'd like to thank very much anyone who read it all. Any thoughts are much appreciated.

28,BF mocked childhood abuse,"My BF 36m and I 40f female together 2yrs got into an argument. It spiraled and when I refused to listen to his attack on my character he went really low. My parents passed when I was young and I was adopted by family members that abused me. He said who raised you and then said oh you don’t have parents and you were abused that’s what’s wrong with you among several other cruel things.

This all stemmed from a small argument that spiraled because I finally stood up for myself and wouldn’t put up with the tirade. Our arguments spiral if I stand up for myself and turn into a verbal attack.

The relationship can be incredibly amazing and the complete opposite. I have never been in a relationships like this before. My last relationship lasted over 10yrs and never was this dramatic. We ended on very good respectful terms.

29,I've recently become a stay-at-home wife and I feel like I'm not doing enough. I feel like my fiance will die without me.,"My fiance (27m) and I (28f) both live in a spare room in my mom's (50f) house. We both have pretty debilitating mental health issues, but he's able to work. I TRY to work, because my experience means I can make more money than him, but I'm just so sick that I'm never able to work for long. I had my last job for a year and a half, before I got fired for being unwell too often. I was ready to find another job as quickly as possible, but my mom told me that I wasn't allowed to. She said her and my grandfather would pay for my health insurance, and that they wanted me to go to school. I'd always wanted to be a therapist, but there were always things in the way. Before we moved back in with my mom, I had supported my fiance while he went through a trade school for carpentry. She said it was his time to support me. But the thing is, he has a health issue that's been getting worse and worse. It's a few thousand dollars to fix, but we can't afford it. He keeps getting infections that we have to pay for, because of it. I'm afraid one of these infections will make it into his blood one day, if we don't hurry. I NEED to work. Yes, I'm putting my own plans on hold, but it was MY choice. I appreciate what she's doing for me, though, so I can't fight her. We're both living in her house rent free. She's willing to pay for our food and my insurance. But I need money... On his paycheck, it'll take more than a year to save enough. His family won't help, either. 

I plan to apply for disability. I can't even leave a room with a closed door without copious amounts of medication, so I think I have a good case. (I'm too scared to open the door.)
I need to be pulling in SOME money. It'll take a while, but it'll be something... 

In the meantime, I cook and I clean (for both him and my mom and siblings), I make his appointments for him, do our laundry, I'm always available sexually, I massage him, I dote on him completely, and I STILL feel like I'm falling short. I HATE not having an income.  I don't know what else I can do!?

30,I (35f) have a younger friend (19m) who treats me like an aunt/older sister. Am I doing him harm if I tell him he can only text me when he really needs me?,"This whole situation is kind of complicated, I genuinely didn't manage to pick a better title. Plus, I'm French and English isn't my native language, sorry if the way I communicate isn't perfect. I'll try explain everything in a simple way:

I'm a 35 year old woman and I met this younger guy a few months ago. This whole thing began because he was really attracted to me, but I turned him down. I have a husband and a son who's exactly as old as him. We stayed friends and our relationship became very intense because he opened up to me. This poor guy is very lonely because he literally doesn't have a family. All his relatives live elsewhere, his mom died of cancer when he was a child, his father is a very ignorant, barbaric man who was/is addicted to gambling and alcohol. Our relationship has become strong because I let him treat me like an aunt, or an older sister.. something like that. 

I'm not  there just to be his emotional support. I've helped him in a concrete way a few times. His dad is so ignorant he couldn't explain to him how to get a doctor to prescribe him his medicament and then go to the pharmacy and buy it, he texted me and asked for help. After I helped him, he said (I'm paraphrasing a little) ''that's why I'm glad to have you by my side. I'm just a little 19 year old kid with limited resources who's scared of the world, I have nobody who guides me, nobody who can teach me anything.. I need an older adult in my life who cares about me. Thank you for being there, you're an amazing person''

 He's not completely lonely, he has a few friends his age, but they are just that.. just a  few immature boys who'll  play football or videogames   with him and then be done with him, very shallow relationships. Nothing meaningful.

  
A few hours ago I saw him  and told him that while this relationship isn't inappropriate, I have a husband and a son, my husband wouldn't want me to be this close to another man. I'm not cheating, but my husband wouldn't understand what kind of relationship we have and would understandably suspect something's up. He started crying and started feeling very lost, but he's harmless. He didn't have any weird reaction, he didn't try to force me to stay. This was my own idea... I told him ''look, we can just try and see if this works... but I won't give you the absolute certainty it will. You can only text me when you really need me. If you're really having a bad day, or you actually need help with something (like that time he didn't know how to get his medicine), I'm here for you. I'm still your older sister who loves you. Okay? But let's put some distance''. 

I genuinely care about this guy and he's not a burden. It wasn't an excuse when I told him that our relationship could be perceived as inappropriate

He said ''I'm so happy to know you're still there, even if I don't get to hear from you every other day. ''

My question now is... am I doing him any harm if I'm just there for him, and ready to talk to him when he needs me, or should I just let him know that he needs to forget me, heal and then move on? 

He  holds me in high regard. He says ''you're extremely beautiful, stylish, you're charming, strong,  confident and caring, your husband is lucky''. I was trying to make the situation sound less dramatic by saying ''I'm not that special, maybe tomorrow or one of these days you'll meet someone even better'' and he said ''no, nobody is better than you''.

\-throwaway

TL;DR This guy who doesn't have a family treats me like family. I told him I couldn't be there for him anymore and he started crying, so I came up with a different idea and told him he can text me when he needs me.

31,I (20f) don’t know what to do with love of my life (27m),"me and partner tend to disagree a couple times a month. we have been together 6months. I never tend to ask for space or say we should have it but our last fight and this ongoing one I have. i am frustrated and do not know what to do.

i love this man so much and he loves me equally as much. however, we misunderstand each other a lot of the time when we’re upset at one another and sometimes it will even be the thing that leads to us arguing.

we have actively spoken about this with one another and identified misunderstanding as a key trigger for argument and I wondered how I can better understand him. he said this would come with time, learning how each other reacts to things, out definition of things, how we interpret one another and I agree.

but my God, we need to lessen the arguing. and I know it is up to me and him both. it gets me so anxious and upsets him as well. we have nearly broken up over this before but refuse to give up on the relationship.

I am due to join him and his family out of town on Friday and I want to conclude on how I can move forward with ending the argumentative atmosphere 

If at the end of the day, the energy wholeheartedly shifts towards us/one of us deciding it’s the end then so be it, but will def be heartbroken. I’ve never loved anyone like this or put in as much effort.

32,Two months in and I (36f) find out he (28m) has a gf (30f),"Two months in and I (36f) find out he (28m) has a gf (30f). Was everything fake?

I don't need closure. I just want to understand what happened? I meet a guy. He's enamored with how I look and my voice. I'm immediately intrigued by his look and the way he talks. He says he's not ready for a relationship but enjoys my company. However, the sexual tension is insane. I was so shy cause he was so attractive to me. We hugged for the first time a week ago and he got an immediate erection. I wasn't sure abt the sexual route because he's so much younger than me and Im not used to the age gap. 

There are low expectations here because I haven't really dated or gotten to know someone since before the pandemic. We discussed it all and decided that if sex happens okay but if not that's okay too because both of us shared a genuine appreciation for having good company and conversation. I thought that was where we were at.

We meet up and talk for hours about five or six times over two months. Conversation is never forced. We make each other laugh. 

 I found it odd but sweet when he mentioned goals he had and how he wanted to reciprocate on a few favors I had done for him. English isn't his first language and I noticed him getting even more comfortable with me and saying phrases in his native language. We made plans for another outing to lunch and I emailed him the reservation I made.

Then four days later he texts me saying his gf went through his phone and he was blocking me. Didn't even apologize.

Then the next day I get an email from his gf telling me they had been together for two years and asking if we slept together. We hadn't and I explained that to her but I still felt like crap. How could he so casually omit that information? What was his intent all this time if he could easily drop me like that? It was such a disappointment...

And now I can't help but feel insecure because what I thought was a budding but genuine friendship dynamic seemed to be just a means to an end? Was he acting like he enjoyed talking to me so much just for sex outside his relationship? How do you know when someone is being fake in enjoying your company?

I only know the gf's age cause I looked at her IG out of curiosity. He has a type. Smh.

34,Why do my partner and I both do this?,"I (25F) have been with my partner (23M) for a few years, we both have a fair share of issues with insecurites, and abandonment issues stemming from childhood trauma. Both on our own mental health journeys seperately supporting one another.

but we keep having this one issue that is truly driving me mad. When faced with an argument instead of understanding immediately that the other is simply expressing a concern, or seeking reassurance on a specific topic we both run to feeling criticized and we begin to get defensive and villainize the other in our head thus really elongating the argument and not fully seeing the others POV until extensively arguing. It's toxic and we both acknowledge it as an issue but it feels instinctual.

For Example, I expressed to my partner that I felt a little upset because of the way he responded to something that happened during intimacy. Instead of addressing it with love and reassurance, he jumped straight to defending his point and made me feel as if I had no basis for my concern until later when he expressed he did understand after going back and forth and really having to explain my feelings.

Any advice for us?  its really impacting the relationship and something I would love to learn more about. I just can't seem to have enough introspection to know exactly why this is such a hold up and instinct for both of us.

35,I 34(M) feel stuck with my 34(F) Girlfriend Of 13 years.,"This is going to be long because its complicated. But I feel like maybe it  will help me finally take the steps I need, to get out of this. I met my  partner in middle school. But didn't start dating her until our mid  20s. As far as I could tell things were good, but she had issues with  depression. She also had issues with conceiving a child which became  something of a need for her. Miraculously, after 7 miscarriages and  being told she prob wouldn't have children. We had a son. But at birth  he got stuck and died before being resuscitated. Hes now 6 and autistic.  Which she has never fully accepted.

Ever  since we had him, I have been treated horribly. I was told by her that  she resented me for her 20s. She got a job with a bunch of much younger  people. Now she goes out and party's all the time after her swing shift.  She has a smoking problem and will put her smoking before the needs of  our son sometimes. I have caught her inappropriately flirting with  coworkers on her phone. And finally about a year ago I caught her doing  that again, confronted her and we took a break. During the break she  told me to take my son, but then behind my back contacted a lawyer and  told the lawyer I was taking him. Which the lawyer then told her to call  authorities because I was kidnapping our son. One thing I should  include is that I have given up everything for our sons autistic needs.  We moved to a small town for her job (DTA), and I gave up mine so she  could pursue hers. Plus covid and his autism in a rural town. She has  signed multiple extension contracts with her job behind my back. She  goes to the bars after her swing shift and tells me every time that she  will be home around this time or that time. Even calls me telling me  shes on her way. But always ends up staying longer.

At  this point I want to leave, but due to circumstances with my son whom I  love dearly, I feel trapped. I also don't have much family and live far  away from the ones I have left. When I try and confront her, she  gaslights and stonewalls. Occasionally having incredibly nasty episodes.  Once she was drinking at the bar with my car, drove it home drunk.  Arrived hours later than she said she would. Then when confronted she  went to our downstairs bathroom and started sticking her fingers down her throat. Stating I was making her do that, because I made her feel sick. We were also suppose to take my son to an autism event at a theme park the next day. Which we missed most of due to her hangover. There is so much more than this that she has done. I just don't want to write a  book on here. I'm not perfect. I have my bad moments. I feel I have  given up everything and I am extremely isolated. I feel like I'm crushed  and every day she makes me feel lesser. But I'm so stuck.

TL:DR My gf gaslights, potentially cheats, makes decisions behind my back, and treats me badly.

36,It's hard for me (F28) to listen to my partner's rants (M28),"Communication issue, I guess, but I don't know what to do.

My partner comes from a very wealthy family. He could, if he had a well-rounded life project, inherit huge money and buy a house in cash. He only has to expose the project to his parents. He has a family that might not be perfect but still is quite supportive of him emotionally. He specialized into engineering, which allows him to get a job in the day if he wants to change, and he's pretty well-paid. 

I, on the other hand, seem to accumulate bad stuff. My body is weak and I have a chronic health condition that made me have a surgery last March, a heavy one. I'm better, but it's hard sometimes. I had to cut-off my family because they were horrible, and there's nothing to expect financially: even they were good parents and sisters, there is no money anyway. I am finishing a Ph.D. with difficulties, I was hired in this fantastic project thanks to my perseverance; nobody believed I would get it and yet I did. Now my field became useless in a matter of a few years as my government thinks that what I am doing is useless (History). I've been preparing my transfer to another field but it's hard with such a narrow, specialty-oriented path. 

Yesterday we found out we had covid that a friend passed on to us, and he started complaining because his first day at his new job was postponed. I on the other hand had a networking weekend that I will not be able not attend, and that would have been VERY USEFUL to get to to get a job. I just couldn't hold it, and told him angrily that I was fed up with his rants. He has everything he can dream of, and still rants a lot about little things. 'It's not because you are going through more difficult stuff that I am not allowed to complain! I am sick of having to complain less just because your life is more difficult' he answered back very angrily. 

I'm a bit at loss, to be honest. It's becoming harder and harder to not feel annoyed when he complains about little things while I'm struggling with so many more parameters of uncertainty. I'm afraid of losing my roof, losing my revenues, and having no backup. He will NEVER have this problem... I don't what to do. I tried to be more patient, I agree that he is allowed to rant, but it's harder and harder to hear it. What do you think?

37,"my ex (18M) and i (18F) broke up two days ago, he still wants to keep contact","TLDR; basically what the title says.

my ex broke up with me and told me that he feels we rushed into the relationship without getting to know each other better first. (i agree with him) he then told me that we can stay friends and if something sparks up again we can start over. we had been getting into a lot of arguments and both of us are extremely busy right now, quality time was very important to both of us and it made us both upset that we could only see each other once or twice a week. 

then today, i texted him because i left a few things at his house and wanted to make sure he had it so he could give it back to me. i also brought up the fact that he had told me he wanted to stay in contact so i asked him if he was still wanting to keep contact, he told me we can talk to each other and see where it goes from there. i then told him to just text me as i didn’t wanna be bothering him (plus it was his idea to stay friends) and striked up a small talk conversation. he left me on delivered and i can see him active on social media.

he still has his location on for me, still follows me on everything (i’m the only girl he does follow on some things), etc.

39,Should i trust my mom or my girlfriend?," TD:LR i want to go to therapy to better myself as a person so my relationship can be healthier, my partner is willing to pay for it because i cannot afford it. My mom is against this, says my partner is trying to manipulate me and put her in her control, and wants to bring me to therapy herself.

&#x200B;

Im a 19M (with autism) and have been dating my 20F (with adhd) for over a year now. We are at a stage of our relationship where we are moving in together and i'm going through immigration. I have a lying habit due to trauma and my partner has been impulsively mad at me as a result. im in a relationship that means a lot to me and im truly in love, she also wants to get married. We've been in private couples therapy before and that has helped with the communication issues we had at the time. My mother also found me public healthcare therapy for my own issues, but it turned out to be group therapy and unhelpful, so after a while it concluded and i didn't go a 2nd time. I believe that im a pathologic liar which prevents me to communicate well and i have issues releasing my anger in healthy ways. After a lying incident, Originally my partner wanted to break up impulsively because she felt it was too much, but after thinking, she said she was willing to pay for my private 1-on-1 therapy which i haven't been able to afford due to the costs of immigration. My moms opinion on my partner isnt good, she thinks she is a manipulator trying to create a dept with me to control me, that we shouldn't be together and that she doesn't think private therapy is right for me and that she wants me to go to therapy but on her own terms. She didn't want me to tell to my partner this conversation, she wanted to keep it between us so that i can make my own mind whitout outside influence, but i told my partner anyways. My partner thinks thats bullshit and that she has a sort of complex, and thinks my mom is the cause of my toxic habits, my partner told me to post on here to get unbiased opinions. what do you guys think of it? Thank you for reading

Girlfriend note:

Partner here, we share the account and so might both reply to users and add ""boyfriend/girlfriend"" at the end to avoid confusion. I believe that his mom is a bad influence for multiple reasons. Our couples therapist said something about his parents being scared of their son growing up and thinks he will get much better and learn to be independant when he no longer lives with them, and his mom has slandered me multiple times in the past for no reason before meeting me, when we'd just started dating, this isn't new behavior. i formed this opinion based on how his mom has treated both me and him ever since i met him, as well as my boyfriend crying repeatedly due to his parents and him feeling like they dont listen to him and him telling me he is scared of them, i'm simply feeling protective so please understand.

i've told him that i don't need to know what is said between him and his therapist, and he'll be able to choose whoever he wants and switch if it doesn't click at no additional cost ! :) I've never done this as intention for him to be indebted, ever since we met he's struggled with depression and other issues, even if in therapy he decides he doesnt wanna be with me i'll be happy i at least had a good influence in helping him grow as a person and be happier.",z2wx3l,15,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z2wx3l/should_i_trust_my_mom_or_my_girlfriend/,relationships
40,I [20M] don't know if she [20F] likes me because I haven't been around people in 2 years.,"Out of high school I worked in tech, and after 2 years I realized that it wasn't the career that I really wanted. My job was remote and my interaction with ""strangers"" was limited to chime calls and slack. So at 20 I'm nearing the end of my first semester of in-person college, and it feels like high-school again.

I've befriended some classmates and I'm happy with these friendships. I just need help figuring out if someone is trying to send me signals or not, to prepare myself to deal with it/let them down easy.

Our class has clinicals together and sometimes we go out to eat afterward (even the Dr) so we've gotten comfortable with each other. We had a thanksgiving/birthday outing at a restaurant today and this is where [20F] enters the scene, I'll call her Kate. Kate bought a whole cake for our classmate, and the Dr. offered to pay for Kate's food. The Dr. had already paid for the birthday person's food so I was determined to pay instead.

We're fighting over the check and Kate says something along the lines of ""Its okay Dr. he likes me"" in a joking manner.
Im a little thrown off because she hasn't bantered like this before but I just go along with it: ""Yeah Dr., let me pay for her, you already paid for ""[birthday person]"".
Kate: ""Its okay Dr., he's my boyfriend""
Me: ""Haha, but no seriously Dr. I got it""
Kate: ""I lied earlier, I dont have work later we were actually going to go on a date""
Me: ""yep, Thanksgiving get away""

Anyway you get the picture. I really like Kate as a friend, (we've been clinical partners this whole semester) but not romantically. I dont want to send any signals that confuse her (if she likes me) but of course I'll be friendly. If it helps to know, she's mentioned that she doesn't have a boyfriend in study group before.

((To top it off the girl I actually have a crush on overheard it at the table and jokingly was cheering us on))

So, do you think that's normal banter in college/with classmates, something you'd say? Am I over thinking this and am I being really presumptuous? Should I just let it play out and wait to see if she ever says anything directly?

As I'm writing this out I realize how childish this is lmao. The reason I'm confused is because I haven't had to deal with this in a while, in high-school I was super introverted and kept to myself so never dealt with it there.

I’ve never related to someone so much, we talked everyday for almost 3 months, from good mornings to good nights. This means a lot to me as I find keeping conversations to be quite difficult, but with her it was like talking to someone I knew for years, easy and smooth and we never ran out of things to say. Now, we never actually met in person, busy full time students (plus me being shy and anxious about meeting new people). 
This is where it gets complicated though, I left for home for the summer and we still messaged but one day she told me a lot was happening in her life and she was going to take a break from her phone and wanted to be alone. And I accepted this, just shooting a message a week later, clarifying I wasn’t expecting a response, just hoping she was doing okay. She did respond, said she appreciated me reaching out among other things and hearts and ended with how she was gonna be away from her phone for a few more weeks. Maybe I’m dumb and naive but I genuinely thought she just needed time. It’s now almost 4 months later and I was clearing my contacts when I saw our messages, I desperately want to message her, it’ll be awkward and desperate but I’m terrified of not finding a connection like that again.

I left her because I was tired of finding out she was dm'ing her exs and kind of flirting too, when I wanted to talk about it she'd not want to talk about it or she'd deny she was flirting with any of them...well, I told her I was going to leave her and 2 days later left her place while she was working… she had since then begged me to go back... she's been about that all this time, but I've mostly ignored her or told her to stop talking to me behind her new GF's back or have replied politely to a how’ve you been?... However, apparently, she's moving to my town soon and she really wants us to meet up ''for coffee''...

Today is the 2nd time she's asked me to meetup while she's visiting town... She says she's willing to do anything, that she'll do anything I ask her to, that she could even give me money, was even talking about us marrying, having a kid and such... She's moving here for a job, and today she was here for a job-related activity and insisted a lot since early morning, sent me pictures, voice notes, and I from the beginning was like 'not interested'... She submitted a picture of her in a lesbian website yesterday, where she says she's looking for a gf... and she sent me a screenshot of it and said ''could you please take advantage of me?"" I told her, she will find one soon...

Anyways... end of the day and I did not meet up with her, she was still begging me for us to get back though, that she will do anything because she hasn't been able to connect with anyone else, that she can't fall in love with anyone else because she's in love with me, that I’m the best partner she’s had, that she needs me in her life... (you get the picture, she's a sweet talker you could say) but I go to check Instagram and Fb and she had blocked me that night… We were talking in Whatsapp and I told her 'I’m going to go ahead and block you here too, so that you can stop the bs already'… she then texted me by SMS... I told her that I don't want to be in her games, where she's making me believe a story and there's another one behind my back which was the theme and reason why I had to break up with her... I mean, just today, she was talking to me like I'm the love of her life, while also blocking me in her socials and then telling me to take her back while asking for a girlfriend in a website, like those things don't match, right? she said it's because I made her feel bad, I told her to leave me out of her games, her ego, her drama and blocked her number…

I'd like to know if I am overreacting. If I maybe should give her closure and meetup? I still care for her a lot. Or should I at least give her a phone call or just keep her blocked until/if I'm ready to meet up?

tl;dr: 2 years after breakup, my exgf is moving to my town to work and has insisted for like 3 days that we meet up for coffee, she wants me back and says i'm the love of her life, while also blocking me on her other socials after the night ended and I didn't meet with her, but still begging me to get back with her while having submitted an 'i want a girlfriend' post in a lesbian website yesterday. I blocked her on whatsapp and sms, told her to not play any more games and to leave me out of her drama.

45,I need your advice. I am unsure what to do next,"I need some advice. I am unsure what to do

First of all, I would like to apologize for the title, and perhaps the subreddit that I chose to use (maybe I am wrong, maybe I am not).

I (22m) have decided almost a year ago to move out from the country that I live in. At that time, I was in a relationship with a girl, and decided to end the relationship because this big decision of mine does not align with her visions for the future.

This is all fine, however, I won't be moving out of the country for another 1 - 2 years because of financial, and proffesional reasons. After the breakup, I told myself that I won't be getting into another relationship until I leave the country because it would be a shit show to get into one that has different visions about the future, stay together for 1-2 years, then suddenly  realise that long distance relationship ain't working. 

This is all still a valid point, but lately I have been feeling so f****d up. I did not flirt with anyone. I have not been on a romantic date with anyone. All I did was to remain with my group of friends, and from time to time to meet a new person (and even that new person, has different future plans and if there were any interess in that respective person, they are all gone). 

The real problem is the fact that I feel the urge to meet people, flirt with them, play and ""play"" with them, have a good time, and if there exist some real bonds, I can also love. However, if I were to do this, when the time of breakup would come, it would feel awkward and pain that could have been avoided. 

Perhaps some of you think now ""well, just find someone with common future interess"". I tried, Ok? The reality is that it is a lot harder and now I am burned out. Even considered to just give a shot with someone that I have some good chemistry and see what happens (that's at least what my heart wants). On the other side, I find that ideea extremely stupid (now is the brain talking).

I guess you can see by now the dilema that I am facing. What would you do if you were in my place? Would you just give a shot to see what happens with someone and then try to solve the problem at the time of leave. Or would you just be like a fish, swimming in the ocean, and if you find another fish to be with is fine, if not is also fine. Or perhaps you have a totally new vision. Tell me, critique me. I am really courious.

46,Balancing my Needs with Bf,"tLDR My (34F) BF (34M) just cancelled coming over tonight bc his band mates got to practice too late. 

Some background. My boyfriend and I  have been dating for almost two years. We both work two jobs and we live about 45 minutes apart. We see each other about one or two nights a week. His two hobbies are tennis and a  kind of “dad’s” band.

Our Thanksgiving plans fell through, so I got a turkey and some stuffing and we were going to cook tomorrow. We were supposed to spend time together Thanksgiving eve, but he scheduled band practice and assured me that he would be over after the practice.

When I talked to him around 8 o’clock, he said that he wouldn’t get there this evening because one of the band members just got in.  It seems like pretty late notice to let me know that he wasn’t coming.

Another thing is that all of my family has passed away (my mother, my father, and my sister) so the holidays are pretty hard for me. He knows that.  It just feels like the band is more of a priority than I am.

I am really supportive of his hobbies and have spent a lot my free time helping him in his job.  Tonight, it just feels like he doesn’t understand how hard the holidays are for me, and how important it was to have him here for me.

In my past relationships, I’ve been a doormat in that I suppressed my own needs to make others happy.  In this relationship, I really try to balance the two. 

What should I do next?

48,Why can’t I get over him?,"My ex-boyfriend (19M) and I (18M) broke up in April because of distance. This was our third time ending our relationship because of distance. We broke up in August of 2021, he went off to college, got in a relationship, came back into town on holiday break and realized he still had feelings for me, where he then broke up with his ex-partner and then we started talking again and shortly got back together. Then, April 2022 came around and I just felt so unhappy (not with him, just in general, he was the only good part) and I lost my temper with him one day and broke up with him. We both admitted to each other it didn’t need to be over, just for the time being. 
Well, despite us both saying this, a statement which he was the initiator of, he got into a relationship two weeks later. The guy is absolutely not his type, like it came as a shock to people. Did I mention we are in the same friend group? Nonetheless, they’ve been together since. When our friend group gets together, we always have the most awkward and intimate interactions. I’ll look over at him and he’s just staring at me and then he smirks, he’ll make jokes sometimes thinking I can’t hear him, and other stuff. I miss him like crazy, he is always on my mind and it is actually annoying. He was my first everything: first love, first kiss, first ‘time’, first guy I ever introduced to my family.  I think that has something to do with it but it makes no sense to me how he’s always on my mind like he is. We were in a relationship for 1.5 years off and on. Why am I not over him?

However, when we tried rewatching it a few weeks ago she immediately turned it off and said she doesn’t want me seeing those types of sex scenes because it will damage our sex life and give me unrealistic expectations.

Then the other night I was watching a show I’ve been watching for a while called Westworld and she walked by during a sex scene. I almost turned the TV off because I already knew what her response would be. And I should have because she just took the remote and started yelling at me.

I was really upset and I asked him why he thought that was relevant at all to tell his mum who I’ve met twice now as of last night.

52,I(28F) regret ending things with the guy(26M) I was dating,"I was dating this guy for two months.

I know it’s cliche but it was truly the most intense connection I have ever had with someone, even from the very beginning.

We both said we never clicked this way with someone else before. 

Things were great at the beginning. Our first date lasted 10 hours. He is sweet, kind, gentle , romantic, smart and interesting.

We have so much in common. I normally get bored with talking with people but I never did with him, truly enjoyed his mind.

Then he started becoming flaky and lacking good communication skills. We had tiny disagreements about this and he ended up apologizing and said he should have communicated more, more openly and hopes I could forgive him. 

That’s just who he is, I’m more talkative and open and he seems to shut down. So I tried to understand his communication ways and not let it get to me.

I said of course and he said we can take things slow and see how things go because we live three hours apart. I agreed with this and thought it was the best move as well.

We continued talking, not as much as we once did but I was okay with that as people have lives and we were taking it slow.

He swore up and down he likes me and I’m the most interesting person he has ever met. He never goes on dates, let  alone drive hours to meet with someone. So I trusted him.

I kept trying to hang out with him and to me it seemed like there was always an excuse.

I was feeling hurt and I asked him if he was even still interested on Saturday. I know I shouldn’t have because I knew this would make him withdrawal.

By Tuesday I didn’t hear anything from him and I was extremely hurt so I ended things with him. I said that I’m confused and hurt by him and I hope he learns to communicate more efficiently in the future but I’m so glad I met him and I wish him the best.

I still haven’t heard from him and I’m really hurt and I miss him and normally I have no problem with flings/people I’m dating to end but something in my gut is telling me it’s not supposed to end like this.

I have no clue what to do and if there is even a way to go back now.

54,My bf(22m) told his girl best friend about my (22f) yeast infection,"My bf (22m) and I (22f) started dating a little over a year ago as seniors in college. When I first met him, he was great friends with and super close to this girl (I’ll call her julia). For the record, I don’t care if my bf is friends with other girls, that isn’t the premise of this post. He and Julia texted daily and shared the very personal details of their lives with each other (he told me this). I met Julia about a month after my bf and I had started dating at his birthday party. The first and only thing she said to me that night was, “you don’t have to worry about your boyfriend and I. We’re just really good friends, that’s all, so pls don’t worry about anything with us. I love you guys together.” Every single time I saw Julia after that, (i’d only see her when I was with my bf) she would fall all over him saying hi, and blatantly ignore my presence. 

Shortly into dating, I found out my bf had been sharing super personal details of our relationship (which included personal stuff about me) with Julia. I.e., if him and I got into an argument, he would text her with the details of the fight, why he was upset with me, and ask her for advice regarding me. This really hurt me so I had a convo w/ him where I explained I was uncomfortable with him sharing these details about our relationship, and ab me, with Julia, because of the way she’s treated me in the past. I told my bf ik Julia is a really good friend to him and I don’t want to impact that, but asked him to please not share with her these intimate details. 

A couple months later, I had a vaginal yeast infection. A few days later, I found out that my bf had told Julia about this. I was so upset and hurt because I previously asked him to not share personal details ab me with Julia, and finding out he had told her this felt like the most personal betrayal of trust. Him and I have talked about it, and when I first told him why I thought it was wrong he shared that with Julia and how it was a breach of privacy beyond belief, he was flabbergasted that I was upset he had told her this at all. It wasn’t until many convos later where he apologized and said he can see where i’m coming from/why this hurt me.

Fast forward to now, this happened around 8 months ago. For a while, I thought I was past it and had forgiven my bf for sharing those details with Julia.  Now, I realize that I still feel completely betrayed and honestly don’t know how I can fully trust my bf again. My bf,  the person I want to be able to trust with the most intimate details of my life, is the same person who shared personal medical details about me to a girl - friend that I had previously asked him not to. Since then, my bf has cut Julia out of his life. I never asked him to, never wanted him to, and he knew this. All I asked was for personal details ab myself/ our intimate relationship details not get shared w/ her. Now, I’m just left with majorly fractured trust and honestly do not know if I can ever fully trust him again. 

At the end of the day, I’m struggling with figuring out if this breach of trust is too big for me to move forward in the relationship and continue trying to build trust or not. Is the foundation of trust between him and I too fractured on my part to even be able to continue with him in a healthy relationship? Since it’s been 8 months, is it even fair that i’m having these emotions resurface, esp since I thought I moved past it?  This cuts deep with me and it’s hard to see how to move on from this

TLDR: My boyfriend(22m) and I (22f) have been dating over a year. 8 months ago he confided in his girl best friend that I had a yeast infection. I thought I moved past it after our convos about this 8 months ago, but it’s only become more clear to me that I can’t seem to let this go.

56,Am I [24M] in the wrong for not helping my sister [20F] out after a failed age gap relationship?,"My sister just recently broke up with her ex who is 32 (30 when they started dating) and is struggling pretty bad right now.

They started dating 2 years ago when my sister just graduated high school. I know that me and like everyone else warned her about dating him, but she pretty much shut us down, said she was mature for her age, and that we were all just unhappy to see her happy in a relationship.

So 2 years later now she had a fallout with her ex which resulted in him dumping her and kicking her out of the house after making her have an abortion. This has lead to her struggling quite a bit as he was the main source of income for all of the finances and she had to drop out of her classes for this semester due to stress.

Problem is that my mom wants me to help her out by letting her move into my place with my GF. I really don’t want to help her out since everyone already warned her beforehand what would happened and how she treated us before she cut most of the family (except our parents) out of her life.

58,I don't feel like a priority and it's making me doubt relationship,"I posted something similar here a few days ago on a throwaway account, but lost the post and forgot the username, so I'm trying again.

My gf and I (25F, 23F) have been together for two years long distance. In the beginning, I really did feel like one of the most important people in her life. But I don't anymore, and even though she apologized for one of these instances (the friend related one), it has all been mounting and left me feeling really sad and unimportant to her.

She was supposed to fly to visit me for eight days next month. But then, she offered to take one of her coworkers extra shifts on the day she was supposed to fly to see me (it wasn't a required shift, she just did it for her coworker). So our eight days dropped to seven. Then, she heard her company was having a Christmas party for those who wanted to attend (also on days she was supposed to be here). She RSVP-ed to go, and our seven days dropped to five.

It hurt me a lot. She still insisted that we would have plenty of time together, but she \*voluntarily\* gave away three days we could have been together after not seeing each other for three months.

But that is only the most recent time I felt like I'm not a priority, which is what makes me so upset.

A few months ago when I was visiting, we again hadn't seen each other in three months when she found out some of her highschool friends were in town. She asked if I would be comfortable going to see them, and I said it would make me a little uncomfortable since I was in a period of my anxiety where I knew meeting three new people at once would cause me a lot of stress.

Since her friends only live a couple of hours away by car, I thought she would say she would visit them after I had gone home. Instead, she said she would go alone then and only stay for a few hours. While I only had two more days to visit her before flying home again. I told her it made me feel kind of unimportant and asked if she could visit them another time, but she got mad at me for it, said she hadn't seen them in years, and would barely talk to me until I, on the verge of an anxiety attack, agreed to go. We ended up visiting them for the entire day.

There have been some smaller things too (cancelling our movie night plans to go eat at a restaurant with her family, completely ignoring me for six hours straight to talk to her brother our first day on a vacation with her family (her parents were kind and talked to me during that, thankfully), cancelled our game night to go out on the town with friends, etc.). But all of them have made me start to have serious doubts about where I fall in her list of priorities. Because all of this had made me feel like her family, coworkers, friends, and social events all come before me, even when we already had plans set in stone.

I tried talking to her about it before in a gentle, non-confrontational way, but she shut down, started crying, and said it wasn't like that at all. I'm really hurt though, and I don't know what to do. I see a future with her, but not if things stay this way.

If there a way I can start a conversation with her where she doesn't feel attacked? On top of that, does anyone have any insight on all of this or think I'm expecting too much? Maybe I'm just being dumb and reading too much into things or expecting too much.

TL;DR: LD girlfriend prioritized her coworker and a Christmas party over almost half of the days she promised to visit with me recently. Throughout the last half of the year, other similar things happened where plans with me were cancelled for friends, family, or where I was ignored by her on our first day of vacation with her family, or when I was guilted into visiting her friends with her if I wanted the day with her before flying home two days later. I don't feel like a high priority to her anymore, and my attempts to start a conversation about it didn't go well. I see a future with her, but not if things stay this way and I'm left feeling like the least important person in her life. Am I expecting too much of her?

60,am I wrong and unable to handle this?,"I had a huge fight with my (30M) GF (29F) and I feel very confused about the relationship and myself. 

it started with her being offensive to me because she felt like I was acting in a way thats hurting her mentally. I do sometimes feel tired and tense and I have hard time noticing this and acting happy. I find it normal that people feel like this sometimes and you can tell they are tense, but I try not taking it personally and otherwise, when I am tired, I do my best to not tell something directly hurtful - which I avoided yesterday. 

but she told me I am tired and tense and not acting normal, when asked what did I say she told me its not about that but about how I make her feel and she thinks this for some time already and has issues handling it because it hurts her. 

then I got angry but still tried to lead a calm discussion and asked her why she didnt tell me sooner. then I realized she never tells me anything and we discussed that. I mentioned she lied to me for 2.5 years on many different occassions even though I already caught her lying and told her its not ok. 

but she says she is affraid to confront me, affraid of my reaction, which I think is normal but not an excuse to lie again and not share worries about our relationship.

now I am not sure if I am really such a bad person or she uses it as an excuse, where should my boundaries be. 

what I do sometimes its I am tense (childhood trauma, ADHD, attachment trust issues insecurities etc.), but I work on it for years now. 

what she did was having an emotional affair with a coworker for 1.5 years, it seems her first reaction is to lie when she feels uncomfortable and she never shares relationship topics with me until we bring it up in an argument. 

she promised (again) she will work on that. but I am not sure if I can trust her and I know I need to work on myself a lot.

she made me the bad guy in the past when she knew she was lying, but I love her and think she is a great person, even though less mature and more simple. 

I want to change and want to believe she will too, I study these things but she wont (at the end she was willing to visit a psychologist for the first time in her life)

TLDR she told me I hurt her when I am tired (not intentionally and I didnt say anything) and feels offended when I continued with how she cant communicate this outside of an argument, how easy is for her to lie to me and what I had to deal with compared to her.",z3cs4d,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z3cs4d/am_i_wrong_and_unable_to_handle_this/,relationships
61,How can I (27f) cope with an impending breakup?,"I’ve (27f) been dating my partner (39m) since February. We met through a mutual friend at their birthday party and started seeing each other soon after. We dated very casually at first before becoming exclusive with one another and hanging out more frequently. After only a few months we were talking and hanging out daily. 

Things were going great and we were getting along so well. I’ve been having family troubles all year and my partner was incredibly supportive through all of it. Naturally I began liking him more and more as we grew closer each passing day.

Recently however he’s decided to relocate to another state to advance his career and is moving after the holidays. I want to be supportive of him since he’s so excited about the opportunity but I’m devastated. He deserves the best and I’d be more ecstatic for him if we didn’t have to break up.

We haven’t discussed any alternatives to the relationship aside from essentially staying friends and moving on. We’ve lived apart the entire time we’ve dated so realistically moving in together isn’t an option. Our work schedules don’t align very well so we’d have limited opportunities to meet up. He hasn’t mentioned any possibility to stay together and honestly seems set on leaving things be. Whenever the topic comes up he just says he’s grateful for the times we’ve spent together.

Again, Im just beyond devastated. I didn’t expect him to be my life partner but I didn’t want our time together to end so soon. I don’t want to stop seeing him yet, but it seems like I don’t have any other option.

This is my first time being in this LDR predicament so I’d like to ask, are my feelings even valid? I feel so selfish and pathetic for even wanting to continue seeing him when he’s not open to the idea. 

How can I deal with this in the meantime? I’m in such shock over this situation that I can’t help but do nothing and cry.

TLDR: partner is moving out of state, i’m staying in home state; break up is imminent. need advice on how to cope and be less sad. please help :(",z3co61,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z3co61/how_can_i_27f_cope_with_an_impending_breakup/,relationships
62,Drunk texts and sober regrets?,"Me (F28) and my ex (M29) broke up around late October (me being the dumper) and now he's dating someone else.
We still communicate but we just argue and try so hard to do the right things. He thinks I'm not good for him and he wants to move on in his life. Although I haven't fixed the real issue between us, I still love him so much. And I know he still loves me. We decided to finally say goodbye. 

The other night I was too drunk so I decided to pour my heart out to him and begging him to stay so we can try again and he agreed. 
I love this man too much to let go.
But everything is still fresh and painful and it might not be a good idea. Nothing is certain still and I still have a lot of problems to fix. 
I realized this when I woke up the next morning. Sober and very hungover.

63,My (23F) bf (24M) didn’t ask me about Thanksgiving 2 years in a row. Should I be worried?,"
My bf and I have been dating about 15 months. Last Thanksgiving, he never brought up me coming, and I figured it’s because our relationship was too new. 

This year, he again didn’t bring it up. This obviously wouldn’t matter except I don’t have family - my dad passed away a few years ago, and I don’t have contact with my mom. I’ll, again, be alone on Thanksgiving. 

Obviously I’m really hurt that 1) he didn’t invite me, and 2) he didn’t even think about the fact I’ll be spending thanksgiving alone until AFTER the fact. Like, if he at least acknowledged I’d be alone and that he feels bad, I could have been more understanding. 

Is this a sign of things to come (general inconsideration of my feelings, me not being a part of his family, etc?) I should also add he’s never been in a long term relationship before.

67,I need advice (26F),"I was at a wedding almost 3 months ago where a guy (28M) was very forward about being interested in me. This was a destination wedding so the days leading up to the wedding he was very flirty & I had heard he was asking about me, etc. I was interested in him but also have been single for so long so was kind of uncomfortable with the attention and the pressure my friends were putting on the situation (telling me “you should make out with him on the dance floor!”). I’m not into dance floor/non-committal make outs or PDA so this thought intimidated me, but I was into the guy. 
Fast forward to the wedding night & we’re hanging out all night and he tries to kiss me on the dance floor and I DODGE it (subconsciously), it wasn’t super obvious I just went in for a hug. But after that I felt kind of awkward even though he was so kind & still asked for my number & hung out with me 
Fast forward to later in the night we are saying goodbye and he gets my number and tells me to text hi he wants to go on a date. I text him my name. He kind of goes in for another kiss when we’re alone but I’m oblivious and don’t realize til after so I just hug him (again ?)
Anyway, he NEVER texts me and I get it, I probably didn’t give him much reciprocated affirmation that I liked him, but I was kind of waiting for him to text me. But he told me to text him which was maybe his way of saying if I was interested to reach out?
Now it’s been almost 3 months and I’m still thinking about him… I want to text him but is it too late?
We have like no mutual friends so part of my thought is I have nothing to lose if he rejects me. I don’t want to keep thinking about him and wondering what if. 

Or would it be a waste to text him and I should just let it go?

He hasn't seen them in several years after we told them that we wanted a mediator/counselor present for awhile if they were to visit him.

After years of trying to make it work unsuccessfully, we thought that we could try having a counselor there for awhile and have offered to cover half of the expense. They tried it once and then went so far as to gaslight the counselor and made veiled threats of putting a wedge in our relationship with our son when he turns 18. They still have the option to see him with the counselor but would rather continue with their antics.

70,no contact,"not what i'd usually post but i don't really have an outlet right now but reddit exists so, here i am. 

i (25 f) was together with my now ex girlfriend (23 f) for a year. she is the most incredible person i've ever had in my life. beautiful inside and out. she was more than i could ever ask for. people like her don't just come into my life. i'm not looking for sympathy, but there's nothing extraordinary or special about me. i'm average. i keep to myself for the most part and i've never really had any true friends or people that stick around long enough to really get to know me. i just sort of exist and i've learned to be okay with that. it hurts sometimes but it's a life i've learned how to live.  

this girl came into my life and i finally experienced a type of happiness i wasn't sure i'd ever feel. i never thought i was capable of loving someone so much. the love felt so genuine and pure. i truly believe she is my first love. this was honestly the best year of my life. we traveled, went to festivals, spent every day together and i felt so at peace. the way my heart fluttered every time we kissed. the she said it first, that we were soulmates. i don't connect with people the way we connected.

it wasn't perfect. there were quite a few things that i struggled with internally, things that i allowed to get in the way of our relationship sometimes. i gave her everything that i was capable of giving her at the time and i really tried my hardest. 

she moved back home to finish her last year of college and i accepted the fact that things wouldn't be the same. i accepted the distance between us and i didn't want to get in the way of her finishing school. i was so happy that she was doing what she needed to do to get her degree. i was happy that she was finally gaining the independence she wanted so badly. i was just so happy to see her be a person. it sucked, and it made me sad sometimes that i we couldn't talk as much but it also felt normal. i focused on working and doing things for myself here and there. i was still happy.

in september we finally got to see each other again. we had this festival planned out for month and i was so excited to spend time with her. i felt like something was off but i told myself i was just being insecure because we hadn't been together for awhile. 

everything went great that week. it felt just as good as every other event we attended so far. we fly back, get back to her apartment..i was just so happy to be with her, it was a sigh of relief.

she went to school the next morning and i spent the day cleaning her apartment, doing laundry for the both of us and unpacking for her to make things a little less stressful. i had kind of a late flight so i had plenty of time to knock all of that out before she came home. i slipped an 'i love you' note under her pillow when i was finished.

i asked her if we could get coffee and a snack before she took me to the airport, and my heart sank when i read the ""we need to talk"" text. 

i knew. 

she got home and sat on the couch next to me. i said ""you're breaking up with me right now, yeah?"" she said yes. 

30 minutes before i needed to be at the airport. 

everything inside me shattered. she explained that with her school workload and just trying to be a functioning person, she couldn't give me what i deserved. i understood. i didn't really get emotional and i didn't argue. i told her that there were a lot of things that i accepted when she moved back home to finish school and that i didn't see anything wrong, i was still happy...but i wasn't going to let that get in the way of her living her life. i told her i want to see her happy and finish school and everything else. i asked her if we could still talk because i really wanted to be apart of her life still. she agreed. we got to the airport, said our goodbyes and i kissed her for the last time. i was absolutely crushed. 

fast forward. we talked here and there, kept our snapchat streak. i didn't press her for conversations and i tried to keep myself busy. i'm not gonna lie. i did some kind shitty things to try and get her attention and i was mean to her. i felt like it was pretty fucked up with the way things ended but in reality it was better her breaking up with me after our trip and the festival. i know she did things the way that she did because she loved me and didn't want to hurt me and i didn't hate her or was mad at her for that. 

i sent her gifts on her birthday at the beginning of november. the snapchat streak ended and i became under the impression that she was seeing someone. i was fucking devastated, you know? she didn't have time for me but all of the sudden she had time for some stranger? i'm still in the process of letting that go. i got angry one night and called her out of the blue expressing how i was feeling about that and i told her that i hoped she was happy. we couldn't talk long because we were both finishing homework and she was getting ready to leave for a trip thanksgiving week. we agreed that we would talk about everything when she got back home. i apologized for my behavior. i was definitely in the wrong for the way i had been treating her over the last couple of weeks and i needed her to know that. 

today i get the text saying it's best if we don't keep in contact. she said she needed to protect herself. i lost it. all of the anger and confusion i felt in the very beginning was just overwhelming. i begged her for one last phone call. that i regret because it was straight up disrespectful of the boundary she was trying to set with me. i asked her if this was goodbye forever, and she said for time being. she blocked me on all socials. 

i sent her the text of everything that i was going to say to her when we were supposed to talk when she got back home. i told her how proud i was of her, how much i loved her and that i would always love her. i told her how much i missed her and how i'll miss her for the rest of my life. i told her how sorry i was for all of mistakes. 

she told me that no contact is what's best for her, and keeping the door open wasn't doing her any good. i left it at that. 

i am absolutely heartbroken. this is the worst feeling in the fucking world. i know she's doing this because this is what she needs to do for herself. it just hurts so fucking bad. i'm so confused because it's like, how can you love someone so much and then cut them off? i know she needs to do this. i know she's doing this because she doesn't want to hurt me. i know she needs to focus on school and be an adult. 

i've never been in this type of situation before. i've never loved someone the way that i love her. we made so many incredible memories this year and i'll cherish that shit until the day that i die. she'll always have a special place in my heart and i pray to whatever the fuck is out there that maybe one day we can try again. maybe not as lovers but as two people who had a lot of fun together. 

i know time heals. i won't feel this way forever and it's not the end of the world. i will heal and move on. i need to give her the space that she's asking for. she deserves that. i'm really sad that i can't see what she's up to or how she's doing. i'm really sad that i'm not going to see her graduate college. i'm just really fucking sad. 

again i'm not asking for any sort of sympathy. i made mistakes after we broke up and i know that. i really needed to write this all out and get it off of my chest because nobody really knows what i'm going through and i hope that somewhere down the line this post eventually might make me feel better. 

thanks to everyone who decides to read all of this

71,How do I (19m) get past being stuck up on "goodnight" texts by my partner (18f).,"How do I (19m) get past being stuck up on ""goodnight"" texts by my partner (18f).

Hello everyone, hope your day (or night, as it is for me!) is going well.  


My partner and I have been talking for a while (about a year, relationship for about 6 months), and one of the things I distinctly remember about her is that whenever we talked at night and she said ""goodnight"" (or any other variation), she would usually be asleep very soon.  


I don't know why, but I got used to that. I found comfort in knowing she confided in me at night, even when we weren't very close.  


But now, I don't know how to bring it up. It makes me weirdly happy whenever she leaves after her goodnights, and the opposite when she doesn't go. I don't understand.  


She's her own person. She has night time schedules, I've always been completely fine (as normal people should...?) about anything else, but for some reason, good night (and even good mornings) have been making me stuck up.  


As a very logical person/thinker, I was never one that wanted a relationship. But after meeting her, I completely fell for her. But this side of me, the punctual, wants-a-predictable-everything side always flares up, and I don't know how to tell her.  


I mean, I can't just say ""hey, I don't like it when you don't sleep after you say goodnight"", that's just a little awkward.  


I believe this is stemming from some attachment or trust issues I've gotten over that rear their head every now and then, but I have no proper idea. Maybe it's just how I love, which wouldn't make sense.  


I don't want to be stuck up on something so tiny. I know we're still young, but she means the world to me. Please give me any advice you can!

72,I feel like something is wrong with our relationship even when I'm not anxious. What can I do to stop this thinking? (24m) (22f),"I'm an anxious person and overthink minor and bigger stuff about my relationship regularly. We're talking most days here. One time this anxiety came to a head with my girlfriend when I overthought if she wanted to be with me any longer. She dismissed any concerns, said she felt sad I was anxious and to come to her whenever I am next feeling that way.

However, if I do that I'll be coming to her most days, so I bottle it up. The last couple of days she's been busy so I've had more time to myself. I've mostly been relaxing and funnily enough even when I'm chilled out my brain turns it into ""if you're relaxed then it must mean your relationship is fizzling out"".

In other words my brain always feels the need to be turned on in order to make sure I'm not complacent in the relationship, even though my girlfriend is very chill and easy to deal with I have worried if it stems from a lack of passion/interest also.

How do I stop overthinking stupid things in general, and just trust her interest in the relationship?

My BF (23M) will purposely bite his nails right next to me (like 6-12inches away from my face) when i do something he doesn't like. He will sit and chew and break off the nail so loudly and chew on them until i snap and then he will say ""shut up, im not hurting you, or i do what i want"" Then he will continue to do this but even louder to the point that I just start crying and snapping at him because he knows I hate this.


When he starts to bite, I will calmly ask him to stop or go to another room. He always rudely declines and continues on with no disregard with how it makes me feel.

75,Not sure if his [m/24] texting style is indicative of his interest in me [F/23],"
Duration of dating: 2.5 months

Reasons why he makes me question his interest/makes me feel insecure: 

- he only initiates conversation when he wants to plan a date
- when we are busy traveling he doesn’t text me to check in 
- I text him 1-2x a week to check in btw 

Reasons why I think he likes me:
- he had me talk to his dad on the phone
- he’s shared pics of us to his mom
- his brother is visiting in a week and he wants me to hang with them
- he’s expressed wanting a relationship (a month ago)
- he wants to meet my parents 
- he asks for my input on where he should move/live next year
- he pays/plans our dates
- he always texts me back immediately or within minutes (never more than an hour) 
- he keeps the text convo going 
- he’s told me he really likes me
- he cooked dinner for me (he said he’s never done that for another girl)

So yeah it’s the texting communication that makes me feel insecure. But our in person connection is really amazing.

76,I was manipulated and I apologized to them afterwards,"I'm 19F and my old best friend is 18F. I just turned 19 and we were best friends for almost four years.
My old best friend is a very toxic person. At the time I had no idea she was obsessed with me and wantedcomplete control over me.

 Like only hang out with her,talk to her and only all the time, be her therapist if she needed someone. I thought we were just best friends and that's what best friends do for eachother.

I was practically brainwashed I think. Mega
manipulated. I realized when I got a boyfriend. Now I wasn't only hers. She has threatened my boyfriend. Tell me to cancel plans because she hasn't seen me in two days. Tell him ""she's mine stay away from her""

I got really overwhelmed really fast. I was actually
happy when I was with my boyfriend I could act like me with him! But then there was the backlash from the ""best friend"" telling me to break up with him or she'll do it for me. Actually l got mad with me for wanting to spend time with him!!

My boyfriend was getting ready to leave for bootcamp in a month, her senior prom which I was her date for was the same day as my boyfriends graduation. And I had to pick. And I chose to go to graduation. And I thought it was no big deal!! I told her in January and prom was in June.

I was yelled at, belittled and bullied for choosing to go to Chicago. A few days went by and I told her we can't be friends. Not only did she manipulate me and attack my boyfriend she also would talk shit about my mom, my dad and the rest of my family.

She went on a tangent about how I can't do this to her and she needs me and that she’ll look for me and find me.  And I left and the last thing she told me was ""I love you""

I'd be lying if I didn't say she doesn't have a hold on mestill, after 7 months. I messaged her an apology,because I felt like I HAVE to. It was my fault somehow because now we aren’t friends! I didn’t pick right, I should have spent more time with her. She was your best friend and you treated her like that! Or something!! 

This was her response:

""I honestly think it's disgusting that you thought to reach out after 7 months and apologize, which I
deserved months ago. Literally sickening. You don't even know how badly you fucked me up. you do not deserve my forgiveness. you do not deserve closure.You make me sick.""

My boyfriend and I are still going strong and he thought the response was hilarious. I just don't know why I tried it, why I even wanted to do that.

After we weren't friends I almost immediately went into mental rehab, not just because of her. But mostly because of her. I was having a really hard time thinking for myself, making choices without someone, ect. And with my boyfriend gone it was even harder.I missed graduation and didn't get to come home until July. I am still struggling

77,Paying rent to boyfriend who owns apartment,"My boyfriend (male mid 30s) invited me (female early 30s) to move in with him. We have been dating for 3 years. He owns his apartment. He is older and has a much higher paying job. I am going back to school to further my career.

I agree with splitting rent equally in regards to utilities (cable, internet, heat and electricity, etc) since we are both using these expenses equally. In regards to splitting his mortgage payments. We are not sure how to split this. I do not think it is fair I pay half of his mortgage. Especially since it is a decent amount more than I am currently paying. How do we decide how much rent I pay? Does this include his strata fees? He was thinking half of his strata and mortgage payments. Or 80% of that half. Which is still more than I am paying now. How do we come to a fair agreement?

78,I feel like I’m paying for being the “girl best friend”,"
I am (17)  have a boyfriend (17)  and he used to be my best friend before we started dating. I was the “girl best friend” the girl who was in love with him. The girl who never allowed him near another girl and even when I myself set him up with a girl it’s  because to make the “chase” thrilling and exciting. Now I fucking regret all my actions I hate myself for being like this. I feel like I’m paying for my sins and ngl I fucking deserve it. I feel like the other woman.  I think it’s what I deserve for being the “girl best friend”. The one who was in love with him and never made any thing work out for him because I was possessive of him.  The one who  was very angry just because he talks to other girl in a romantic way. 

We started dating but at what cost. He got a new girl female friend through a professional setting and I feel like it’s my time to pay for my sins. It’s not us anymore in our small bubble. The bubble has expanded more than I even expected and I hate it. I fucking hate it.I feel replaced. I fucking hate this. I’m paying for my sins and I truly deserve it if we’re being honest here. At the same time it hurts, I’m replaced. I don’t know if im overreacting. I just need somewhere to vent and talk about my feelings. I used to be his number one priority just  me and him  nobody in between us. He’s the reason why my standards are so high. He taught me how a woman should be treated before when we were still best friends. He would even travel to meet me after my classes in uni would end.  I am literally breaking down over this. It’s not the same anymore I fucking hate it. I feel like everything has changed after we got together. He doesn’t even seem to be messaging me much. He’s going out alot with his new friends. I don’t know if I can do this anymore I’m literally loosing my mind over this

79,"Reached out to ex-best friend, didn’t receive a friendly response","Friend and I had a falling out about 5 months ago. I’ve been contemplating reaching back out for like a month now. Going back-in forth trying to decide how or if to reach back out. Then the perfect opportunity presented itself: our favorite band that we listened to all throughout our 5 year friendship is playing semi near us. I know she would’ve heard about it. So a couple nights ago I decided to send her a text: “Hey, are you going to the Blank concert? I haven’t bought my tickets yet, trying to find someone to go with. No one I know beside you listens to them lol.” And she just responded with, “yup.” And now a couple of days have passed with no other texts from her besides the, “yup.” 

To me, if she wanted to have a conversation with me, she would have responded with something more than, “yup.” I’m not going to push a conversation with her if she doesn’t want to talk to me. It already took a lot of courage to even message her in the 1st place. If I were to message her again after that response, I’d feel desperate. She responded really quick too, like legit 5min after I texted her. Which to me, makes it even worse. I  guess it’s just time to move on now like officially. She doesn’t want to talk and I got my answer lol. Maybe I’ll go to the concert with my brother. This sucks lol. Has anyone gone through anything similar? Any advice on how to move on?

80,Boyfriend met up with his ex and lied,"This is something I’ve (20f) been quietly dealing with for months now. Around 2 months ago it was accidentally revealed to me that my boyfriend (20m) had cheated on one of his exes. For a while I had a bad feeling about how much contact he still had with his most recent ex (not the one he cheated on) and how often he would mention her and I kind of went on a downward spiral after hearing that and ended up checking his phone. He and ex-gf had long, deep convos about her life and mental health, texted things like “I miss you” to each other, and tried to meet up many times throughout our 10 month relationship. He never mentioned any of this. As far as I could tell they only actually saw each other one time, over the summer, and when I checked our own texts from that time he had lied to me about where he was. He also still has all of her nudes saved in their snapchat messages.

I haven’t really known what to do. He’s a great boyfriend otherwise, treats me well, and I love him a lot. I don’t know how to bring this up because I don’t want to admit that I snooped through his phone and I feel bad about it. I don’t feel like any physical cheating happened but I’m not okay with being lied to and I don’t feel good about his ex. It took him a long time to ask me out, which he later told me was because he wanted to be sure he was over her. I’m just confused and kind of hurt and I’ve been keeping this to myself but now I don’t know if I should just confess and confront him. Any advice is appreciated.

81,My gf is unmotivated and not career oriented at all. I feel as she is lazy and it’s driving me crazy.,"Me (26) and my GF(24) have been together for about 3 1/2 years. She works at a club doing bottle service. I will be honest I truly just don’t see that being a career she works only 2x a week and the rest of the week she just stays at home wakes up until 12/1 PM watches tv all day and just lounges around she does have a kid (5) and is very responsible for him he goes to school so during the day(7am - 3:20 pm) she can do anything but chooses to just lounge I have tried telling her I want her to get a career find something she likes and try it. She says “I don’t know what I want to do” “I don’t like anything” “I am happy this way” and it’s just frustrating bcs I literally am doing my best to help motivate her I work at a very good company making decent money my career is everything to me and I feel like it should be to most people. I understand we are different but I just can’t not stand people being lazy and wasting their days away doing nothing but laying around. She also lives with her parents and they help her with her son. She is a clean person and does help me clean when she stays over but I just feel like she could be doing more with her life and just doesn’t. I do love her and want things to work out but truly I don’t know how else i can help her I have listened , told her to find a therapist maybe that would help her and I have even offered to pay for the therapist for her but she refuses saying this is who she is. Can anyone give me some advice I know my post is all over the place but this is my first time doing this.  Thank you!

TL;DR I (26M) and my gf (24F) I personally am all about my career and building an empire my gf on the other hand is unmotivated and lazy in my opinion she works as a bottle service girl 2 nights out of the week. I don’t see the club as a career path so have stated my opinion I have told her she should look into seeing what is next after the club and what she would like doing as a career path she basically has said she does not like anything , likes being this way and does not see any issue kind of a figure it out as you go person and that to me is just wrong. She sleeps until 12/1/2 pm sometimes and will just lay around all day she does clean up after herself and does keep up with her child (5) but while her son is in school she does nothing and I just can’t stand her doing nothing productive with all that free time. It’s been 3 1/2 years together and she has worked at the club for all that time.

82,How much longer should I (26F) wait for him (28M) to bring up the prospect of being his girlfriend," 

Hey everyone, I’m looking for some advice on my current situation.

So I’ve (26F) been seeing this guy (28M) for 2 months (our first date was 2 September). Since we met, we have been going on a date every Saturday and then back to his place in the evening to watch a movie/spend time together, and I stay the night. We slept together on the third date, to which I learnt after we had that he was actually a virgin and it had been his first time. I told him that that doesn’t really change my opinion of him and he appreciated that. He has never been in a relationship. We have similar upbringings, similar value systems, goals, good stable careers/future career prospects, and the same sense of humour, and we are both very affectionate. We both want long-term, and both want children in the next few years. I feel like we have a really good base to work from.

Things are going well. However, he has not brought up the conversation of becoming official, although we are both not seeing other people. I have tried to previously, but he has just stated he’s fine with how things were progressing and to ‘see where things go.’ So I guess I’ve left the ball in his court to bring up/ask about being official, as I don’t want to seem pushy.

I think mentally I have decided to wait until the weekend of 3 Dec (exactly 3 months) to see if anything is said. Otherwise, I’m going to start pulling away to protect my feelings and potentially explain to him that he hasn’t indicated that he wants anything serious and to stop this from progressing if it's going nowhere. I think letting this go over Christmas would drag things on and make me feel worse. I don’t expect to meet his family at Christmas or anything like that, I’d just like the ‘officialness’ if that makes sense.

TL:DR In your experience, how long would you wait for someone to propose becoming official (boyfriend/girlfriend)? I’ve been in two previous relationships, but I was quite young, so I guess it was different, and things happened pretty quickly.",z3ae37,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z3ae37/how_much_longer_should_i_26f_wait_for_him_28m_to/,relationships

84,How Do i tell my friend that I want to date her ex?,"#  I understand that from the tittle it already sounds bad but let me explain first.   

 for a little backstory My friend Niah,15F \[not her real name\] and her ""boyfriend"" Ishimac,15M\[Not his real name\] have been on and off dating for the past year due to him cheating ND wanting open relationships and also him being tired of it feeling like Hes worshiping her and getting almost nothing in return.  very recently Niah got a new boyfriend and told us that she was over Ishimac and ""didn't give af abt him"" so that was that, then after her boyfriend and her broke up she went back to calling Ishimac her boyfriend in public.

 He believed the whole time that they were still dating, me and my other friend Kelly,16M \[not his real name\] told Ishimac that he was being cheated on and he didn't believe us, so we said OK

 During this time, I,15F gained feeling for Ishimac and told him of course so that started a flirty type of friendship between us. Move to the present we've had this type of friendship/relationship for about 2-3 weeks, and it's been cool only thing is his 'girlfriend' Niah pretends like she doesn't want him but as soon as he even talks to another girl, she blows her case.

 So i walk into the building yesterday bc I believed there was practice for the sport that we all play and turns out there wasn't my mother had already dropped me off so i call her to come get me only people from my team that are there are Kelly and Ishimac Soo i say hello and Kely leaves I ask ishimac if he called his om he says yes and then I'm like okay see you later as I'm walking away he tells me to "" wait a minute and that he will walk with me"" I waited for him and then once in the hall we are walking to leave and he stops me and ""can i one time?"" I say yes and he kisses me

It Was Something that can only be described as faking magical

something I wouldn't mind doing again

so that's that and when I get home, I make a little post about it on Wattpad, huge mistake Kelly \[Niah's best friend\] found the account and told her Now she's pissed at me and is ignoring me, Kelly told me that he told her and told me to cut Ishimac off...but I don't want to.... 

I understand how I could be the asshole but i feel as though my crush is clouding most of my vision, on one hand i want to be a good friend ad cut Ishimac off but on the other hand Niah should see that we both are happy around each other and she should at least talk to us instead of trying to ice us out till she gets her way how do I go about that?

85,I (23m) was supposed to protect my best friend (22f) from her toxic ex and now I feel like I'm taking advantage of her. What do I do???,"Hey y'all, this is my second time using reddit and I'm really hoping someone can tell me the best way to go about things. Sorry that this is so long, but this is the first time I've let it all out and I don't know what information is relevant.

Before I explain my side of the story, I want to preface this by giving you the rundown on our history and why I feel so terrible about all of this. You guys can skip to ""Current Situation"" if you don't want to read.

Tl;dr at the bottom for those who don't want to read a wall of text.

Background:

I met A in middle school over a decade ago. She was bullied for being overweight, while I was bullied over being poor and having terrible hygiene. For reasons I will never understand, A gravitated to me and we eventually became friends. She started taking care of me in small ways, inviting me over to her house just so I can eat and incorporating me into their family so that I had someplace to go whenever my mom was on the rampage. I didn't need her help so much when I started working in high school, but we remained close. When she hit puberty, the girls started being incredibly vicious towards her and harassed her relentlessly over her weight which resulted in incredibly low self-esteem and even an ED in junior year. At the same time, I stopped getting bullied as much, both because I stopped being there as often and because I guess I stopped looking so pathetic and vulnerable at that point. I felt terrible for A and did everything I could to protect her, but she really didn't improve until she left our state completely to go to college.

Anyway, after she left, I started detailing cars which eventually evolved into a full-time job. And whenever we talked, it seemed like she was doing pretty good. For a few years, things seemed okay, and I was happy for her.

And then toxic ex came into the picture.

I'm gonna call him Darren because that's his name. Darren (Then 28) threw up a bunch of red flags from the beginning. Aside from the age gap, I immediately got the sense that he wasn't a good guy. He would casually neg her about her eating habits and appearance, he got jealous over several of her male classmates, he was incapable of holding down a job, and there was a night early on where he got too drunk and had left several hickeys in a very visible place despite her repeatedly telling him not to. Throughout all of this, I tried to support her as best I could. He managed to isolate her from her family (who disapproved from the beginning) and I didn't want to leave her without a support system if the situation ever became unsafe.

After two years, it eventually came out that he'd started texting an 18 y/o behind A's back. She left him once again and this time she transferred back to our state so that she could hopefully leave him behind for good. During this time, I managed to convince her to take up volunteer work with me. We started going to an animal shelter over the weekends and she immediately fell in love with it. The other volunteers are all super nice to her, most of the dogs have become obsessed with her, and it seems like everyone there is able to see her for who she is, which is amazing. I expected her to stop going when her next semester started, especially since she's still working, but she refused to give it up, not that I was complaining. It felt great to finally have my friend back.

Not even a month after they broke up, though, Darren arrived on her doorstep crying and begging her to take him back. Despite her rejecting him, he'd keep coming around almost daily, swapping between ""I made a horrible mistake and I'll do anything to win you back"" and ""I guess I'll just go back to my ap since she's the only one who cares."" A managed to hold out for another month of his constant harassment before finally conceding and giving him a tentative second chance.

Of course, Darren couldn't manage to behave for even a month before going right back to his previous behavior. This time, though, he started to focus on me. He'd start sending me threatening texts to stay away from A and that ""I'm the only man she needs, not you."" Eventually, it got so bad that he confronted me at the shelter. This is the first time I think I messed up: instead of ignoring him, I went off on him instead, calling him out on all of the BS he put A through in their relationship. He started screaming that he was gonna kick my ass (Which he can't. He's 5'5"" and all chub while I'm 6 ft and take care of myself) until the owners had to kick him out, after which he came home and started threatening A. This confrontation ended with another breakup.

After the second time dumping him, A's father pulled me aside and told me that he was really worried about his daughter. If the last time was any indication, it seemed like Darren wouldn't stop harassing her until he got what he wanted, and we were all terrified of what would happen if she took him back another time. The two of us, along with his brother, came up with a schedule where we would each spend a few days at her house to make sure he wouldn't be able to confront her again. Of course, since her dad is getting older and her brother has his own family to worry about, I ended up being the one with her most of the time.

&#x200B;

Current Situation:

As we were afraid of, Darren ended up becoming a huge problem. Even four months later, he is still stalking her home and work. So far, he's come by the house eight times, tried to approach her in public another three, and burned a bra in her driveway claiming that it was her favorite (It wasn't. No idea whose it was.) A is finally in the process of getting a restraining order against him after being begged for months, but it's been a long and stressful process.

Throughout all of this, I've been pretty much living with her. I'm no longer staying the night since her place doesn't allow pets and I have a rescue pittie at home, but I spend a great deal of time with her whenever I can or whenever she feels unsafe. I can't even say that it's to protect her anymore. I know I should be thinking mainly about her safety, especially since his unhinged behaviors seem to be escalating, but I just missed being able to hang around like this.

And this is where I messed up big time. We were hanging out together last night like we usually do. Since Thanksgiving is around the corner, she bought one of those apple pie wines so we can unwind after what feels like a lifetime of stress. I usually don't drink a lot (Read: AT ALL) because of the situation with my mom, but I ended up drinking half of the bottle on an empty stomach and it hit me harder than I thought it would.

We hung out for another hour or so just chilling out and playing Violet on her Switch. I don't really remember the specifics of the conversation, but some way or another we ended up cuddling on the couch and then I kissed her. I don't know why I did it. I immediately regretted it and tried to leave even though she was telling me it was okay. It really wasn't. I stayed long enough to sober up while she just pretended everything was normal, and then I walked home and passed out.

I woke up today feeling absolutely devastated. I texted her a long apology around noon and she texted back that she left for her grandparents' this morning for the holiday but wants to talk in person when she gets back.

I just can't believe I did that. I feel like I took the trust she had in me and became another predator the second I was able to. I'm already never going to drink again, but please Reddit, is there ANYTHING I can do to make this up to her? She already refuses to believe that she's beautiful or smart or worthy of respect. I'm so afraid that she's gonna take this situation and think it's something she deserved to have happen to her.

What the hell do I do now?

86,My separated parents are doing Thanksgiving at the same time—what do I do?,"I (17F) have separated parents. I currently live with my mom full time, but I still see my dad at least once a month (all by choice, I could live half time at his house if I wanted, but I need more stability). Historically we haven’t had big Thanksgivings bc we’re LC with most of our relatives. My mom also has celebrated Thanksgiving a day late in the past, but it’s unfair for her to always postpone it and it makes her kind of sad. For Thanksgiving this year, my parents both decided to plan the meal around 4 pm for very valid reasons, but that makes it difficult to figure out where and how to spend my time.

My dad is married to a very wonderful woman who is really good at cooking and has a bigger family. Whenever we go over for holidays they always have tons of board games and food. It’s very fun and everyone is very welcoming. However, because there’s at least 10 people attending (my dad/sis/me and her family), including my dad’s wife’s mom, they are starting at 4pm.

My mom is only making food for my sister, her, me, and my grandpa (on my dad’s side) with Alzheimers. My grandma abused him so he now lives in a care facility nearby. Although he’s my dad’s step-dad, my mom was the only one to step up and take care of him/deal with his Alzheimers (it’s difficult to be around him for long because his Alzheimers is very far along). My mom also makes super yummy food and since it’ll only be us she’s catered to our personal tastes much more. However, bc my grandpa’s Alzheimers makes him very upset at night, we have to eat earlier in the day. Thus, my mom planned to eat around 4pm as well.

Having my grandpa go to my dad’s house isn’t really an option, because nobody can really handle his dementia (even I can only handle it for a short period of time by myself), especially when he starts asking if his wife left him (abuse + dementia is a bad combination). Excluding him entirely isn’t an option either bc he doesn’t deserve that.

87,How do I handle the lack of intimacy in my relationship?,"So my girlfriend and I have a long distance
relationship going so the only thing I can get as
close to intimacy is hopping on a call with her, but
she was never really to big on sexual intimacy
even while we were in the same state whenever I
ask her to help me out I always get the same
responses ""leave it for tomorrow"" ""I'm not in the
mood"" or ""I haven't shaved"" and she doesn't
really like me watching porn either so that leaves
me kind of stuck on what to do and each time I'm
left with false hope on getting something
sometime soon but that never really happens
she does end up sending me stuff every once in a
while but as mentioned it does take a while last
time I got something was close to two months
ago we already had a discussion about it in which
she acknowledges her not really providing whilst
not approving the use of porn and she said she
wouldn't mind me watching it, it clearly makes her
upset so I told her I wouldn't watch any, after that
she sent me something and I thought it was it new
leaf being turned but then she proceeded to not
provide anything for the past 2 months. This
pretty much sums up my problem in which I have
no clue what to do. I love my girlfriend and try to
be patient but she's making false promises and
getting my hopes up. This very issue is causing
me to interact with her in a way that's very distant
and not really up to talking I go every day
wondering if it's gonna be the day I get what I
want and the more I don't get something the more
it's on my mind so it's pretty much all I can think

88,Is it best if I cut off my ex fully even if my girlfriend hasn't displayed any recent problems with it? (24m) (22f),"My ex was my friend for months before we got together and went back to that dynamic after we broke up, and although things ended amicably and were initiated by her, she also confessed having feelings for me still as recent as a few months ago.

My girlfriend interacted with my ex a few times while we were also developing our own friendship. Once we got together my girlfriend stated how there were one or two occasions where she was overthought about my ex, how she thought I still had feelings for my ex, and how she overthought a lot about when my ex made an unfair comment once and said me and my girlfriend would get bored of each other.

My ex did this type of thing once or twice while me and my girlfriend were not official but getting closer and even confessed her feelings for me when it was looking obvious that me and my girlfriend would be official soon.

Since we've been together, my ex has respectably kept her distance, hasn't made any dumb comments and hasn't tried to disrupt our relationship. However, on one or two occasions where I've told my girlfriend I'd be spending time around my ex she understandbly felt uncomfortable but also said she trusts me fully.

I have no feelings whatsoever for my ex and we're better as friends, but I'd also not want to make my girlfriend unnecessarily uncomfortable any more. Is this something I should make a decision on myself and distance myself for good, or should I see how my girlfriend feels first?

89,"Man Made Me Pay on First Date, But Hasn't Paid Me Back...","A man took me out on a ""date"". I was really excited, blew off a work project, got new heels, a dress, and was excited to be wined and dined. I really did put in a lot of time, money, and energy trying to impress him and be good company.

I didn't ask him about whether he was paying and expected him to pay since he asked me out. When the bill came, he just gave me a blank stare. I asked him if he was taking care of it and he just said ""No"".

I got visibly upset and he started bragging about other women that wanted him, then threatened to get up and leave if I didn't pay when I started crying. I panicked about being left with the whole bill. I also was honestly extremely insulted because I had invested a lot getting ready to impress him and was excited to see this guy, and this felt like a massive smack in the face.

He said we could split it and we both put in our cards. Turns out, he had actually LOCKED his card. The waitress came back and said ""I'm really sorry, his card didn't work"" and she told me my card got charged for BOTH meals.

Wanting to be ""nice"", I didn't complain, I just said that's okay and signed the check, but I'm wondering if this was my legal obligation. Can I complain to the restaurant?

I feel as though it was not fair he bullied me into paying for him and I got screwed over for trying to be a good person and pay my share out of respect for the restaurant, even though it was a date HE asked me on. But then the restaurant charged me for BOTH meals because this guy locked his card.

The guy also seemed very, very pleased with himself that he didn't need to pay and wouldn't leave a tip either, so I had to put down the little cash I had (20) too. It was 100 for both plus tip and this guy refused to pay anything and bullied me into paying for him by locking his card. I'm not sure what else I could have done and feel really bad about the whole thing. Could I have asked to only pay for myself?

ALSO: since my house was down the street from the restaurant, I stupidly let him talk me into ""walking me home"" and then when we got to my door, he said he had to use the bathroom so I stupidly let him inside. He then took his shoes off and tried to stay, and I had to kick him out. Thankfully my 30 year old roommate was there, so the guy sheepishly left when he realized another man was in the house, but I'm worried something terrible could have happened. I'm kind of shocked at my naivety looking back. Could he have bullied me into segs too if my roommate wasn't there?

**TLDR:** Guy bullied me into paying and I was really really shocked and unsure how to handle it. How do I avoid this happening again? my mom said it would have been rude to ask upfront if he was paying and i wasted my time and feel terrible and traumatized. I also feel as thought I was unintelligent, thoughts? there are men who fight in WARS and this guy was afraid of paying a check, can't believe I wasted my time

Update: He texted me a week after this ordeal, says he was really excited to get to know me, he ""doesn't see not paying as undervaluing me at all"", he wishes we could have kissed, and really wants to meet again. In this case, should I ask him to send me the cash back or just ignore him?",z3dozr,0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z3dozr/man_made_me_pay_on_first_date_but_hasnt_paid_me/,relationships
90,"Relationship with girlfriend is very easy, I even worry I bore her. If she never mentions any issues should I assume things are good? (23m) (23f)","My relationship with my girlfriend is very easy. What makes it even more surprising is that it's this way even though we're long distance. She's more than happy to not text me for hours. If I'm busy she's understanding and accepts it, she never pressures me to video call, and we can even chill while playing video games for hours without barely saying anything.

To me, these things are combined feel like a lack of passion or something that she'd find problematic. She even said before how she wasn't upset when her and an ex broke up because their relationship was boring. And that's what I worry about ours being also.

In person things are affectionate, fun, passionate. But we only see each other once every few months. In the meantime things are mostly very trivial. It's mostly a routine of just dropping a message anywhere from waking up-5pm, seeing if one of us is busy, then chilling out while playing video games and then saying goodnight.

I personally am not bored. I enjoy the safe, relaxing aspect. But I do worry she'll get bored - especially after what she said about her ex. It's only when she says she misses or loves me once every week or two that I remember she's in love with me, honestly.

91,Mixed signals from new girlfriend,"We started talking at the end of October and became official at the start of November. We are in a LDR with a 16hr time difference. She said she loves me less than a week after becoming official. Since then, she constantly uses words of affection. However, when we talk, it always feel that I'm the one putting in the effort to make sure that the conversation continues. She almost never asks questions about me, which makes me wonder if she's even interested in getting to know me. But if you love or are interested in someone, wouldn't you want to know more about them and ask them questions? 

When she texts, after replying, half of which are usually one word replies, she immediately goes offline. We've never had a conversation where we're constantly online for periods of time. She is partially deaf and uses hearing aid, she has to listen to music at very loud volumes. She is uncomfortable with calls as she said that she wouldn't be able to hear me. 

She is not fond of writing goodnight messages, so conversations for the day will end adruptly when she falls asleep whenever. Sometimes the next day she'll send a ""sorry babe I fell asleep"" text. One evening, she said she was going out for an event that lasts for an hour and she did not read my reply the whole night afterwards until the next day, almost 18 hours later. I understand the importance of me time and personal space, and I don't think I'm asking for or expecting much here. I don't think this is normal in a relationship, sometimes it doesn't feel like a relationship. I hate how I feel about it. Sometimes it feels as if she's only talking to me when it's convenient for her. I'm having trouble trusting her. Sometimes she reassures me by saying she's out with her girl friends or her family.

She said that she wants a serious relationship and has never been in one before. She had a few fwb but she said none of them wanted anything serious. I sometimes think that maybe she's just playing me for the attention and affection, and has multiple interests, sexual or non-sexual. She has depression for which she is attending therapy once a week for. I've talked with her about putting in more effort in this relationship and she promised to spend more time with me, saying that she wasn't as engaged because of exams. However, exams are over and I feel that not much has changed. My biggest insecurity is my partner being unloyal. I want to make this work, should I keep trying? Or should I just move on?

92,BF (M27) left me (F22) when I am injured.,"TL;DR: -BF left me when I am injured making out as though he had urgent/important work to do, when he actually didn't have a strict time limit on his work. 

-I badly broke my arm around 3am Saturday morning. 
-My boyfreind (lives in another city) got to the hospital as soon as he could, and he took care of me over the weekend.
-I am in extreme pain, I will need surgery next week and I cannot do much for myself. 

-On Monday morning he had a driving test he had to go back to his own city for.
-I asked him when he would come back to mine after his test (a train ticket from his city to mine is inexpensive and its an hour away).
-He said he needs to do his work so cannot come back untill that's done, he could come in a couple days. His work is an online coding course he is doing. 

-I had to reach out to my disabled mother who I do not get on with, and her boyfriend came to pick me up and took me to stay with them. I really do not like being at my mum's but I had no other choice, I cannot cook for myself right now. 

-On Tuesday night I ring my BF and ask him about his day, he says he's been hanging out with a friend all day. He hasn't done any work since he got to his city. I thought he had deadlines/his work was urgent which is why he could not come back to mine to help me. So I question him about this. He gets annoyed and says I need to stop being up his ass about his work. Turns out there was no strict deadlines those days, it's a pretty self-directed course. 

-I am hurt that he chose not to come back and take care of me when he could've. It makes me feel as though I cannot trust that he will be there for me in times of need. 

-We plan to move to another country together (where we know no one). But now I'm unsure if I can rely on him. What will I do if I need help and I dont have any family or freinds in that country?

Aside from this the relationship has been great the 3 years we have been together. But this is the first time I've been in a bad situation like this in which I needed his help.

I’m kinda scared of getting rejected too . I’ve never asked a guy out first but I really like him a lot that sometimes the words gunna spill out of my mouth but I control myself too much.

94,Nostalgia for Ex-girlfriend affecting relationship with my [32M] wife [32F],"Apologies in advance for the wall of text but I have been struggling with this issue for the last few weeks and I am not sure what to do.

I have been in a great relationship with my wife for for almost 9 years now. Great chemistry, communicate easily, same goals in life. We were starting to talk about having our first child soon. While theres been ups and downs but I have never really had real doubts about our relationship, until now…

I recently stumbled into some letters that I got from my ex-girlfriend back when we first started dating and made the mistake of reading through a few of them and now I can’t get her out of my mind.

For background, my ex and I dated throughout most of undergraduate college. It was my first real long-term relationship and we thought we were going to get married at some point. Until one day, seemingly out of the blue, she told me she was no longer in love with me and broke things off. There was no cheating, no other guy. It was just all of a sudden, she no longer felt the same way about me. It hurt me, I questioned if I did something wrong, was I actually a bad boyfriend, could I have done something to salvaged it etc etc.

But regardless I disconnected from her as much as possible. Blocked on social media and phone, deleted all pictures, etc. etc. I went to a different graduate school. I didn’t date for a year, trying to throw myself into my studies and hobbies, until I met my now wife in a grad class. We hit it off well immediately and I thought she was attractive but I didn’t ask her out for almost half a year because I was still recovering. Until after a random night of drinking with friends and I asked her out and we have been together ever since.

I have never had really thought of my ex-girlfriend this entire 9 years since I entered into that relationship with my wife. We have actually bumped into each other a few times throughout the years - work conferences (we are all lawyers), random meeting in trains, reunion dinner set up by old mutual friends. Never once have I felt like I still had some unresolved feelings for her until now…

The last few weeks I can’t get her out of my head. I started comparing her to wife (she was more sexually forward, more well spoken etc.) and revisiting how I messed up. I feel terrible and can’t even look at my wife in the eyes.

95,"I can’t tell the difference between someone hinting at having a crush and someone just being nice to me, and I don’t want to ruin a friendship.","Tl;dr: My friend is doing things that may or may not be signs of them having a crush on me, and idk whether or not they are.


I (13M) am horrible with deciphering emotions, especially over text. A friend of mine, “Jane” (14F), has recently asked for my phone number and started texting with me, as people do. The issue is, she is doing the same sort of text pattern (hard to explain) that I did when I messaged a crush a couple years back.

She also has asked me to do stuff that are right on the line between date and hang out, like going to lunch, meeting at the market, etc. On top of that, Jane is just really nice to me, or at least she laughs at my stupid funnies and smiles at me when we see eachother, stuff like that.

This feels really stupid writing out, but I need help figuring this out. I would happily go out with her, but I’m also perfectly happy being friends. But if I try to make a move, and she shuts me down, that bridge is pretty much burnt.

96,He(22) really likes me but prioritizes his friends over me. Seeing for 3 months,"He's my ex. Broke up with me at the beginning of the summer bc he didn't feel connected to me as much as his friends and his previous ex. He said we didn't share the same humor. 

I moved on and lost all feelings for him. Fast forward to school, we met again in the same class. He texted me that he missed talking with me and would like to hang out. After 2 weeks of constant hanging initiated by him, I teased him that I was living rent free in his head. And he admitted. He asked of he could have a second chance bc he grew a stronger feeling for me. I told him I have to see if he actually changed for better or not before getting back.

He did change. He has been treating me better than the first time we met. So I have hopes. Till recently, when I caught a cold, I texted him and he just sent back a sad emoji. So I took it as a hint that something is wrong. I asked about it. Long story short, he was busy playing game with his friends and he didn't think having a cold was that big of a deal. That made me extremely sad ""does that mean you prioritize your friends over me even when I'm sick?"" 

He said he feels closer and connected to his friends more than me so he puts more effort into them. So, I told him it's the same thing all over again. It was literally the reason he broke up with me in the first place.

I asked if he wants to end this and he said no. He said he wants to introduce me to his friends and see if our humor will mix up. So he can be fully himself around me, and that's how he grow feelings. I asked what if I never change my humor, he said he doesn't know.

I think it's best to stop seeing my ex...even though he did clarify that he didn't think being sick is a big deal even if it happens to him and he is sick atm. He doesn't know I take it seriously so he apologized and he guarantee that he would be serious about bc at the end of the day he wants to be a better partner.

Tldr: my ex has stronger feelings for me and treats me better than the first time. But not enough to prioritize me over his friend...bc I don't share the same humor as them. He wants to me to meet his friends so their humor rub off on me. I'm thinking about quitting this bc it was the same reason he broke up in the first place.

97,I’m being harassed by a group of girls and I don’t know wtf to do,"
To condense a lot of things and to give some context. I[M21] noticed some girls[F20] bullying and sexually harassing another girl at my university. My name got out and the girls I reported now claim that I am harassing them. The school unsure who to believe decided to just have everyone agree to not contact each other. I agreed got a lawyer just in case and called it a day. 


Now the issue is that they knew my primary Reddit account, hence the throwaway, they have started to follow me and I noticed when I posted about the situation they commented under fake accounts that were fresh and brand new. They commented and said things that only someone intimately aware of the situation could know. Then I have noticed after I blocked all of them on Instagram I’ve started to get follow requests from clearly fake accounts. With names of people I have never met and no one I know has ever met.  Like zero mutual friends. 

I talked to my lawyer and since it’s fake accounts there’s nothing I can do legally short of bringing it to court and subpoena them. So what can I do? Is there anything other then deleting my old accounts? I want literally nothing to do with any of them.  They’ve already turned most of the people I know at my uni against me, what can I do to at least leave me alone online?

98,"I can't handle conflicts, no matter how small, and they turn my anxiety up a million.","TLDR: I (early 20sF) can't handle any conflict, regardless how ridiculously small or big it is. I'm not sure if it's partly due to my abusive childhood, family and current situation. Or am I overthinking things? I can't tell if I'm surrounding myself with toxic people or if I'm the toxic person.



**For a little background**, I'm an only child to two parents who hate each other. I've been a baby when I was first dragged in their fights. Actual fights. Not just with words. My father (60sM) is extremely abusive. I'm still living with them because I'm finishing uni and not working - we aren't American, they promised they'd pay for my uni and it's lawfully mandatory for parents to take care of their kids until their mid 20s when higher Ed ends. I was told not to get a job so I can focus on studies. That said, my household is very volatile and I'm left shaken, and I feel very damaged. I'm hypersensitive to loud sounds (bangs, yelling, things falling), dark rooms, a lot of people. Makes me feel I'll have a panic attack. I show severe symptoms of general + social anxiety, depression, C-PTSD, misophonia and I don't have a diagnosis yet (no money to run tests just yet). I'm doing my best to avoid all disagreements and issues, I'm a people pleaser. I don't ever wanna make anyone feel bad, or the more horrifying ways I've felt, because I know what it's like.


**Conflict wise** - a friend (20s) of mine was taking an exam last week, an exam I took in January. It's been almost 10 months from it. I forwarded them all the material I've had, along with questions I can remember we were given. I omitted two things, however not on purpose. One thing was a general knowledge the prof was babbling about since day one. For 5 months. Thing two was something that spontaneously happened to only a select couple students because they didn't finish their assignments. My friend told me all their assignments were done. Took the exam. I asked how it went since they didn't text me. Then they wrote to me ""You should've told me Thing One and Thing Two were happening. I almost fainted when I heard them!!"". I replied back with the explanation I wrote here. Genuinely I forgot it, thought they knew or were okay with the things. My heart started pounding and racing, stomach turned, cold all over and couldn't breathe. I got a same weird sensation i usually get when there's a fight at home. The tone of texts deemed super hostile and guilting me as if I purposely tried to ruin the exam. I cross my heart up and down, I've sent this person whole academic year worthy of material and numerous texts, instructions, questions. Never meant to harm them at all. I told them this and apologized profusely and got a response back ""Fuck it, still should've told me"".




I feel absolutely guilty now. I had issues with this person before. TLDR, I told a mutual friend to pass the message for this exam friend not to wait on me, I was not gonna go by car with them. Mutual didn't pass it on, they sat in the car for a few mins and I came out to a warzone. The screaming level of the aforementioned (not mutual) friend was so bad all my hairs went up, ears started to ring, I dropped my things because I was afraid. Last time someone yelled in my household as much, I got hit. I froze and barely made out the words ""just go without me"". We met up at a place later and I got bashed, screamed at again, how I'm insanely rude, selfish and nasty. My lips were trembling and I said I told Mutual in front of other people to just go without me, not wait up. Mutual pretended they didn't hear, then that I didn't say anything. I got dizzy, I gave another apology and said just that I'm using the car as a passenger again or going with them anywhere. I understand their frustrations in both cases, I genuinely said all I knew and have told them I'm not gonna go with them.



I'm not sure whether to make this right. Or how. I understand I've caused issues here. I apologized more than five times in both cases. I mean my apologies. I can't fix not remembering the info or the car thing, even though mutual friend was told twice I'm not going with them. I've already lost one long-term close friend that was verbally and mentally abusive, a narcissistic ""brutally honest"" type that thought they were a Goddess and us were mere mortals. Another close friend (that I introduced to this one) also left with them, because they like the brutally honest friend better (brutally honest one is filthy rich, buys branded stuff and is an IG model, I'm neither one of these things, just an average adolescent). For a couple years now I feel very low and that I'm probably the problem in all of this. Trying my hardest to heal in my home environment, but it's a struggle. I carry guilt about these situations and relationships on top of it all too.",z2v8lo,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z2v8lo/i_cant_handle_conflicts_no_matter_how_small_and/,relationships

Then he left friendsgiving without saying bye or thank you to my friends because he had to deal with his dogs at home. This is a constant issue with having to go watch the dogs and not being able to do things with me and my family. I brought it up to him and he barely responded, and now when I suggested taking a break to think about what I said he apologized and hasnt spoken to me at all, so I have 0 insight on whats going on but I dont want to always be the one fighting for communication etc. This isnt a great description of what is going on, but what advice do you guys have on this situation?",z37moa,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z37moa/my_bf_m20_doesnt_prioritize_me_f21_or_communicate/,relationships
100,My (27F) SO (30m) said he'd break up with me if I don't improve my speech,"I have been in a LDR with my SO for over a year now, he speaks English as his first language.

t's embarrassing to admit, but I have been causing issues in the relationship with my voice and accent. For context, even though I've majored in English, it is not my mother tongue, and I have never traveled abroad either. So it's clear that I don't sound like a native when speaking. My voice causes my SO to get mad and upset because of his mysophobia and also because he says I am sounding too nasally, which is something he detests and triggers an irrational anger. 

I have been practicing a more enunciating voice and so far it has been working, but every so often I slip up a pronunciation. Either because the sounds are not very clear to me, or because I can't mimic the same sound. 

Sometimes he is the one that points out when I make a mistake. And he hates that, because my SO believes that it means I'm not practicing or not being mindful of my accent and that I don't care. He said he is not a teacher and doesn't want to be in that position in which he has to remind me in a conversation when I am mispronouncing something, because I should know or I should catch myself. 

Last week out of the blue he issued an ultimatum in which he mentioned that if I did not improve on 3 things, one of them being my voice and pronunciation, he'd break up with me next month. He said that if it was really important to me I'd improve on something that hurts him daily. So I started to make sure I am speaking correctly, participating in language learning servers, practicing enunciation and immersing even more. 

What made me want to post was that tonight we were having a good conversation until things went sour. I mispronounced a word and tried to correct myself for five minutes, he got impatient and said that I'm not paying attention to how I move my lips and I'm not listening to myself, and that's why he gets so frustrated with me and then proceeded to mimic my pronunciation and point out how I was getting it wrong. After that, he hung up and said he doesn't want to talk to me because I'm unwilling or incapable of improving my speech and its making him painfully aware. I tried to explain that I was practicing but he said he doesn't believe me.

Am I being dismissive of him when I can't always catch myself and end up making mistakes? I'm really lost and feeling worthless. It's like I can't ever get anything right.

She then hit me with that she doesn’t see me physically as a man, that i don’t challenge her in life,  that she’s gotten 4 promotions at work and i have yet to get promoted, she said she’s into politics and I’m not, and she said I’m too nice and always there for her which makes it easy for her to leave me…

Everyone i know is telling me i dodged a bullet.  But DURING our relationship (once we broke up i didn’t even recognize her anymore which sucks) she was the best person I’ve ever been around, she hit every part of the list that i look for in a partner , and lastly she just made me feel really happy and truly cared about which I’ve never gotten to experience like that before..

Me and her work in the same company and we had class last week. We talked and i confessed that i still had feelings for her.  She then proceeded to tell me she had sex with someone less than a month after dumping me and that they’ve been together ever since..  my heart was crushed and i honestly feel weak as a man for being the age i am and having these strong of emotions..

It’s effecting me currently as I’m talking to a new girl that i wasn’t ready to talk to but forced myself to try to get over my ex.  Me and the new girl had sex the night my ex told me she fucked someone and i regret doing it now.  I have this new girl really wanting to be with me, and all i can think of is my ex. I honestly just felt so much pain then numbness that day which is why i think i did it.  Shit even while having sex with her i was thinking of my ex :/ i even almost said her name…

I thought my ex would be my one, i can’t tell the future so who really knows but i have to move on and better/work on myself. It’s hard and i get nervous of not being able to find my true partner the older I’m getting… and yes i know i need to end things with the girl I’m talking to now, it’s hard and I’ve tried but she gets sad and depressed sometimes and i don’t want to add to it by breaking heart.. I’m fucked.  Love is one hell of a drug :( 

TL:DR-  First time falling in love with a girl and she dumped me and said some malicious things to me.  With a new girl now and it’s obvious i still have feelings for my ex and i can’t stop thinking about her.  Ex belittles me yet i still think of the happiness that she brought me and all of the good times.  I don’t know how to move on and scared i won’t find better and be once a peace with a partner that i find amazing instead of settling because of getting older.",z37g12,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z37g12/i_cant_get_over_my_last_breakup_first_time_ive/,relationships
102,We fight a lot,"Me(m32) and my pregnant girlfriend (f32), we are in this situation about 4 years..

We will fight once a week or two over stuff and it will always explode and always will get to the point where we want to leave each other and start talking whom get what and who should leave the house.

It will start small and will get bigger and bigger and we will both say hurtful stuff. 
And also we could fight about everything.

103,I (M24) caught my girlfriend (F21) Lying about her and her ex’s relationship,"So basically my girlfriend and I have been official for a month but seeing each other for 2. This story starts right when we became official. 

We decided to get STD tests before becoming sexually actively, and when we did that, she came back with gonorrhea. Naturally, I was shocked, but that is when she told me she slept with her ex who cheated on her 2 months before we met one another. That Was a bit of a concern considering they broke up over a year ago and 2 months is kind of recent, but I decided to stay and just have her get the STD resolved. I tested negative and am still negative.

   Anyways, she told me before that ever since they broke up, they had a Hi and Bye Relationship. but after she got this STD, i clearly pushed back on that and said that was not the truth. she said she was sorry and we continued from there.

   Fast forward to today, we were together and I realized I never got her exes name. She said his name was Anthony, and I realized that Anthony is the same name of a “friend” who bought her food at 9pm one night while we were in a relationship. I asked if this was the same anthony and she said yes. Also the same Anthony she shares a hulu account with. I was Really uncomfortable because she told me her relationship was hi and bye with him, they were civil, etc. But then she slept with him right before we were together and he brings her food late at night sometimes. apparently she also emotionally vented to him before meeting me.  

 I now don’t know how to proceed. I feel i love her, but this is a lot for me. I also told her this and that i was considering leaving, and she started breaking down and crying. She also said she doesn’t want to be alive but sincerely apologized right after for that because she said it was manipulative of her to say that. She said she will block him or any other ex she has as well. What should I do?  

 TLDR: girlfriend said that she had a much different relationship with her ex than was true. she feels guilty and will do anything to gain my trust again.",z2vu3a,4,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z2vu3a/i_m24_caught_my_girlfriend_f21_lying_about_her/,relationships
104,Graduating this Spring and going back home. Gf wants me to stay with her,"I (M24) am graduating from my university in spring. My gf (F22) is staying for one more year to finish her program. Here's the problem. I never really enjoyed university. I've never felt close to anyone here. Not even my girlfriend. Anyone I ever met here I just saw as someone I ""had"" to make friends with if i didn't want to be completely alone here. I don't ever plan on contacting them again when I graduate and go home.

My gf wants me to stay and live with her since we bought an apartment together near the campus. I told her that I wanna leave right after graduating as I miss home and really want to go there. She seemed upset about that news understandably. I haven't told her my completely honest reason why. I'm wondering if I should tell her, I'm wondering if I should stay or if I should go. 

Tldr: I want to leave university to go home, my gf wants me to stay with her. I'm stuck between staying or leaving.",z31813,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z31813/graduating_this_spring_and_going_back_home_gf/,relationships
105,"My online friend (25F) hasn't answered my texts since 4 days ago, I'm (25M) extremely worried."," We have been friends and I have talked to this person for the last 18 months every day, some days they stop messaging for the duration of the day, but are sure to tell me how they are at the end of the day.  
This time my friend had an argument with her mother, or something happened the last thing she said was ""My mother likes to throw a monkey wrench every time I stabilize"", and asked a question to something I said ""Why are you doing a 5 person project?"" making me think that the conversation would continue, but those were the only messages I received. I asked her what her mother did, and I didn't got a reply. It's been more than 4 days. I've tried calling her on her phone, and texting over multiple social media, I see my messages are delivered.

She has been facing depression over the last months, and I'm afraid this got to a point in which she did something stupid. I'm scared, I value this person very deeply, and I don't know what to do. I tried contacting her sister, but since we are not friends in Facebook, I couldn't place a call.

The only other thing I have to contact her is her mother's email address, but I'm afraid that if I text her, things will get worse, and I really want my friend to be alive.

**What can I do? I'm panicking, and I really care about her well being, what is the correct thing to do?**

106,Is it too early to ask out my friends ex?,"I (18M) have a friend (18M) who was together with his gf (17F) for about six months. They broke up about a month ago. I always liked his gf as a person, but after their breakup i have realised i have feelings towards her. My friend is the one who ended their relationship and his reasoning was that he wasnt ready to deal with her mental problems. Once they broke up i found out that they hadnt really been happy in the relationship for the last month of it and i think my friend had already broken up with her mentally.

Now im kind of wondering if it is too early for me to ask her out/start spending more time with her. I havent talked to my friend about it yet but i asked a mutual friend and he said that i should wait a bit. I just really dont want to loose my friend but i also feel like me and this girl have a real connection.

107,my gf of 3 years [21] gives me [19] a feeling of just being trash Part 2 bc part one was removed..,"
So I could go into really insane details if more info is needed but for now I just want to assess the situation.

So whenever we fight(which is a lot over stupid stuff and her not believing me even tho I show her proof/ avidance of that I'm right) she tells me really mean stuff like that she wishes she never met me, her ex was better, I should just leave, I should just stop caring and so on

Like I do my best to never ever seek a fight or fight a fight when we argue most of the time I will just apologize about making a mistake (which most of the time I didn't) to cool her down, I will take full blame and responsibility for stuff I never did wrong because I just don't wanna fight with her, she is the first one to lose her temper and scream, while I'm sitting there and tell her to please calm down and just say what's wrong and we talk about it.. Even though she is older I sometimes have the feeling that she is less mature than I am. I don't want to say she is all wrong sometimes I do stuff wrong (no I never cheated on her or any of that stuff) like not text her for one hour bc I was busy with school stuff I do apologize for that as well bc I am sorry that I made a mistake and I really mean it but then she straight up screams and shouts at me for about 1h or 2h... If I ever tell her sth she will always tell me she is older then me and she knows stuff better than I do...

It has been gotten so bad that she makes me cry by being so mean over legit ANYTHING I took to long to respond to a text? She gets mad (even tho if she doesn't respond to a text like 20min I calmly ask her why she didn't text me and I accept it) I say a word I picked up from my class mates? She gets mad at me bc I ""developing without her"" I have to study 2h for a test? She gets mad bc I don't spend that time with her (even though I'm in voice with her so she can listen and be at my side) every little thing I do that she doesn't like ends not in us talking about it no it ends in her hanging up the phone, leaving the call, screaming at me, ignoring me, blocking me, being really mean and hurt full to me, and me actually thinking the thing that I didn't do wrong was my fault..

Here is an simple example
Last week I joined voice after coming bsck from eating and she instantly accused me of texting other women like straight up screamed into my face. I'm setting there legit with my mouth open bc I didn't know what the fuck is happening, so after being screamed at for 30 min I asked her in a calm voice to pls calm down and tell me where she has that info from and she is like ""yea I checked battlenet (for those who don't know what that is its like WhatsApp for like a gaming platform) and you were permanently online"" and I was like ""yea OK but I wasn't, I was eating I told you and you know I leave my phone upstairs all the time"" and she said I'm not telling the truth (still screaming btw) and I was like OK so you don't trust me so let's check my phones data usage in that time turns out I wasn't fucking online I showed her proof and she told me I like kind of edited the picture or sth.. After that I was like ugh pls babe yoz ask me what I had to say for myself and explain myself but than you do not believe how do you want to resolve this matter? I know I'm not laying I'm showing you proof which you don't want to see. (also I send her a Screenshot of all my chats so she saw I didn't text anyone, which she also didn't believe and wanted to see) 

So I went ahead Uninstalled the app and was like yea I will just Uninstall it so it can't make anymore trouble so you don't have to have any fear and in the future we avoid the problem. After that she says the usual that she just hates me and so on. Like I don't know what to do anymore.. Thanks for the feedback in advance :D

Edit: we are in a long distance relationship

So how do I initiate a breakup? I have never done anything like this she has been my first... I want it to be over quick and leave no opportunity for her to talk shit into me? 

TL;DR: every time we argue she gets rly mad at me even for little stuff, I try to avoid fights so I try to calm her down she tells me I am the biggest mistake of her life, tells me she hates me, tells me to just stop caring about us, tells me her ex was better (cheated on her) if she acuses me of anything I haven't done and I show her proof she doesn't care I'm not allowed to do anything with my friends or play video games on my own, can't sleep long on the weekends bc she things I don't want time with her",z2v978,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z2v978/my_gf_of_3_years_21_gives_me_19_a_feeling_of_just/,relationships
108,Why is it so hard for me to break up with someone who I know isn’t right for me?,"Tl;dr - looking for support and guidance on trusting myself and making relationship decisions.


 I’m dating someone who I don’t think is right for me but I keep doubting myself.    For as long as I can remember I’ve gotten into relationships out of a hunger for love. And I often wind up in situations for way too long or with people who aren’t right for me.  Even after seeing legitimate red flags or abuse, or just seeing that there isn’t a spark or any kind of true compatibility, I find it difficult to make the decision to break up and stick with it. Unless I wait until it’s way too late and the decision is SUPER obvious.    


  I’m in this situation currently. (Me 34f) (him 34m)  Dating for about 6 weeks. I’m not super happy, I’m always worried about some red flags I saw in the beginning, (emphasizing sex even after I told him my needs were to go slow and develop emotionally first, leaving me feeling pressured and not on the same page) and not being consistent in general. He talks about his exes too much and even on the first date compared me to one of them in a bad light. I don’t feel like I’m getting close with him, sex isn’t good at all for me. (Because i did it with him way sooner than I wanted and now I can’t get into it. I don’t feel emotionally connected enough) I just don’t feel comfortable or super connected with him even texting or seeing each other. The list goes on.  


    But then I tell myself all of these excuses like “he was extremely thoughtful on your birthday”(that he originally forgot about)- the birthday actually was very very thoughtful and romantic. “he has been more consistent” (after feeling so uncomfortable with his inconsistency that I brought it up.)  “he has made good efforts with making dates and pays for things” or “what if this is just part of developing a relationship?” “He focuses a lot of effort on my pleasure when we do get down” “what if he just needs time to fully open up?”


  In general I spend most of the time thinking about him in a worried state. And I’ve had the distinct thought that “he is not the one for me. I don’t feel like I’m at home.” In one sense, I could talk to him about my feelings, but will I ever actually feel better or stop worrying? On the other hand I just break it off and go through the grief process of mourning the possibility and doubting myself.

109,Am I being selfish?,"A friend (21M) of mine, let's call them A, is living on the other side of the country for a few months and they are feeling lonely, so they spent a considerable amount of money to come visit me and a few other friends over the weekend last month. I (20F) am pretty busy on the weekend, and I'm already struggling to get everything done without any additional plans bc of my mental health, so I was hesitant about going.

I am not a generous person by nature, so when I don't want to give up something to make a friend happy, I always struggle to tell if that is a normal boundary or my selfishness showing. A, on the other hand, is one of the most generous people I know. They have done a lot for me over the past few months, like staying up to help me pass my classes (we're in college), picking me up after a concert and dropping me home so I wouldn't be out alone at night, and taking care of me when I got drunk and had a really bad hangover at their place. I feel like I owe them, although everytime I imply that they assure me they don't want anything in return.

So of course I hung out with them that weekend. Their close friend said they weren't available on Sunday, which I thought was pretty insensitive considering the time and money A spent to come see us. I suggested places to go and made it so that I didn't have to go very far away, and although I struggled to get out of my house, we hung out on Saturday night and Sunday. I missed out on something I wanted to get done that Sunday, and I was kind of bitter about it, but I thought A deserved that small sacrifice.

But earlier this month A said they were coming back this weekend. I agreed half-heartedly. Then another friend said they were throwing a housewarming party the very next week. I was worried, because I can't afford to go out every week and I'm going to be even busier the upcoming month doing something that really matters to me. So I suggested A postponed their visit to next week so we could attend the party together. But now the party was also postponed and my friends aren't all available that day. A would rather spend time with us than attend the party. I said I honestly couldn't afford to go out twice. Now I'm worried it might have come off as ""you're less important than the party"". Which isn't true, but I've never been to a housewarming party and I also haven't seen that friend in a while, so I'd rather attend the party than hang out with someone I saw last month.

I don't know if what I'm doing is right. Am I being ungrateful and selfish? Should I go anyway? Or is it a reasonable boundary?

110,Boyfriend and I decided early on in our relationship that neither of us wanted marriage. Except now I do.,"So my partner (38m) and I (31f) have been together just under 5 years and have lived together for 2.5 years. We are very committed, we own pets and a car together and have a joint savings account that will go towards a down payment on a house.

I would say we are somewhat nontraditional. Neither of us wants kids (he's already had a vasectomy) and we are extremely nonreligious. We are also both grossed out by the patriarchal history of marriage and enjoy that our more conservative/Christian relatives are a little scandalized by us ""living in sin"" or whatever. For these reasons, we discussed early on in our relationship that neither of us was really interested in marriage. 

So I feel a little silly for finally admitting to myself that I do, actually, want to get married. Or more specifically, I want for him to want to marry me. Which maybe sounds bad, but I guess I suddenly feel a little hurt by the fact that he hasn't asked. He's brought it up once or twice, but only in the very practical sense of doing it to get a better mortgage rate once we're ready to buy a house or something similar. 

But I want to get married for sappy emotional reasons, and I find myself feeling a little envious of friend's cutsey proposals and engagement rings, and I don't know how to bring it up to my partner. I honestly think he would agree to it if I asked him, but I would feel like I was forcing him into something he's at best apathetic about and at worst actively trying to avoid. 

It sounds incredibly stupid but I would rather hint at it and have him bring it up directly than to bring it up directly myself. Because then I would feel like his idea, which is what I really want. So how should I go about indirectly making it known that I want him to ask me? 


Tl;dr I changed my mind about not wanting marriage and want to make it known to my partner without feeling like I'm forcing it.",z23731,196,149,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z23731/boyfriend_and_i_decided_early_on_in_our/,relationships
111,He told me he didn’t want a girlfriend right now then asked me to be his girlfriend shortly after… I’m confused. Is this a bad sign?,"X and I have known each other for about three weeks. We met on a dating app, and are both 25 years old. 

I will start by saying I clearly state “no hookups” in my dating profile. So X and I had a great first date, and we ended up hanging out regularly after that. X started inviting me to do things with him, in social situations where I met many of his close friends and coworkers. I took this as a green flag. For the past week we have hung out every day. 

I am definitely developing feelings for him. Well yesterday, we had our first discussion about defining the relationship- it confused me. 

Our discussion: X asks me what I am looking for, am I looking for a boyfriend right now. I said yes. Then X went on to explain his intentions to me- explaining how he feels like he might be falling for me but due to his lack of many past experiences with sex he’s not sure he’s looking for a girlfriend right now… he wants to experience more casual sex. He told me he ghosted all the girls he was talking to when he met me because he is only emotionally interested in me. At this point I made it clear I do not think we are on the same page and I truly am looking to (slowly) build a serious relationship and have no interest in casual sex. 

After I made my intentions clear he kinda changed his mind and said he thinks it would be worth it to only exclusively be with me. And then he asked me to be his girlfriend. Is it just me or is this a little confusing? I’m not sure if it’s a red flag or not. 

To be honest I am both glad he was honest with me about how he feels, and I am a little sad that he obviously has doubts about me. I feel confused about how the discussion went. I am concerned if I do date him he will still end up chasing other women for casual sex, or won’t be satisfied with me. If I am honest with myself I wish he had just asked me straight out to be his girlfriend and said he’s only interested in me… since that is the way I feel about him.

112,I (26F) feel like I pressured my partner (31M) of 5 years into buying an engagement ring,"As a 26F, I’ve seen lots of my acquaintances get engaged recently and it’s something my mother keeps reminding me of (she even told one of my siblings that she worries my partner changed his mind about marrying me). I’ve been content with my relationship with my 31M partner (we’ve been together for 5 years) but at times hearing all the “outside noise” has made me think - is he having second thoughts? Why is he waiting? What’s the cause for hesitation? For reference, we’ve lived together for a little over a year and have a few pets together. We’ve discussed marriage and we’ve known for a while that it is the next step for us. Nothing in his behavior has made me think he was having second thoughts. It was more so me feeling pressure from my mother and comparing myself to others around my age. I had a talk with my partner about it last week where I got visibly upset and teared up. A few days later I saw on his phone that he purchased an engagement ring. As much as I should be excited, it feels somewhat disingenuous because I feel like he only bought it cause I made him feel bad or pressured him? Idk what to do.

113,I (30m) found my ex wife’s (29f) Reddit account and I don’t know if I should reach out to her or not,"Throwaway because don’t want this on my main. Trigger warning; mention of stillbirth and small mention of abuse.

This has me in a really tough spot. My wife and I divorced a long while ago (not specifying when to try and keep this from revealing too many details). I’m 30 she’s 29. We were together in total about 4 and a half years. She wanted to divorce because I honestly wasn’t trying. All I did was be in our game room and leave her by herself. Never listened to her or cared about her needs. I wasn’t there for her when her aunt died for reasons I don’t wanna talk about here. My wife tried really fucking hard to fix things and make the relationship work. Her last relationship, the guy abused her horrifically. Physically emotionally and sexually. I do think she settled for me as a safe option despite really loving me but I just was jaded from my work and other life stresses and I just didn’t put in the work she needed me to. I was heartbroken when she told me it was over and I tried to get her to go to marriage counseling with me but she was done. It was too late. I made a lot of other mistakes but don’t wanna get into that. 

I was always secretly insecure in the relationship because I felt like she was still in love with someone from her past (not her abusive ex). She never really told me about him but he had taken a picture of her and her dog and when she talked to me about it, she just had this look in her eyes like she missed that guy and had feelings for him she wasn’t able to talk about. Besides that I never heard about him and the couple times I asked about him she would shut down the conversation but always seemed so sad just at the thought of him.

Anyway onto the current issue. I found her Reddit account by accident. She posted a picture of herself on a subreddit (not nsfw) and there she was. I couldn’t believe it. When I clicked on her profile there were other posts. She’s already with someone, been married a few months and I’m pretty sure it’s the guy I suspect she was in love with before me based on some comments she left on other relationship related posts. I want to say right now that she never cheated on me, there was no infidelity. I want to be happy for her but when I saw her picture I knew I was still in love with her and miss her so much.

The reason why I want to reach out to her: She had another Reddit account linked with her main one where she posts on r/babyloss. Turns out she and this guy had a baby boy a couple months ago and the baby was stillborn. Her posts on that subreddit are agonizing to read and I know she is in so much pain. I’m worried about her. I’m worried that she’s not getting the support she needs from her current partner. I’m worried about her mental health because while we were together she really suffered with depression and anxiety and she almost harmed herself very badly at one point. But she got so much better the year she left me. Started working on herself and accepted that I wasn’t going to change for her.I can’t stop thinking “what if that was our baby, what if we were still together” and how much I would show her how deeply I love her and I would make up for all of my mistakes. Deep down I know she loves this man a hell of a lot more than she could ever love me. Part of me knows that she and I were not right for each other and I put her through hell when she trusted me to be a safe place for her after the abuse she endured. I know deep down that this guy is probably the love of her life. But the other part of me is holding on to hope that I can reach out to her and be a friend at the very least and help her through this pain. I’m angry at her for leaving me because if she hadn’t none of this would have happened to her. Angry at her for moving on with him. Angry at her for spending years with me when she clearly never stopped loving him. The heart wants what it wants I guess.

I don’t know what to do. If I reach out I don’t plan on telling her I found her accounts because her posts are so vulnerable, I don’t want her to feel like I’m reentering her life just because I know so much about what has happened to her. She doesn’t have any social media but I still have her phone number and honestly I’ve been thinking about reaching out for months, before I found her accounts on here, to see if she would be open to having me in her life. My mom supports this idea I have but now that I know she had a baby and lost that baby I have no idea what to do. This is so distressing for me and I can’t stop thinking about her. I just needed to get this out and I hope all you internet strangers can give me some food for thought.

tl;dr: I found my ex wife’s reddit account. Turns out she had a stillborn baby and is in a lot of pain, sharing some things on her account and I feel so bad for her that I want to reach out and help her. I still am in love with her and miss her greatly.

Edit: she also recently had a death of someone she loved dearly that she posted about in a grief subreddit and fuck I can’t imagine the pain she is in right now and if she is getting what she actually needs from this guy and other people around her. Fuck.

(24m) (22f),"To put it simply, the entire time I've known and been with my girlfriend she's never been clingy. She'll gladly give me space, understands if I'm busy for days in a row and has only been emotional when I was unable to visit her at one point after weeks of not seeing her.

She's also rarely jealous. A handful of times she'll jokingly say ""your beautiful accent better not charm any other ladies"" or jokingly say how guys like me. Aside from a week or two where she was a little uncomfortable around a close girl friend of mine, she's never showed discomfort.

And I know this is all healthy, but it sadly makes me feel unwanted and unloved sometimes.

She's casually brought up before that she's not a clingy person, and also another time that she has no doubt or fear and trusts me 100%, so I should take it as a positive, but I can't help but wish she was a bit more in my face sometimes.

Bad anybody else had a partner that wasn't clingy? How'd you get used to it?

**TL;DR: girlfriend isn't clingy or jealous which makes me doubt her interest sometimes. What should I do to adapt to this mindset she has overall**",z34h3z,0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z34h3z/girlfriend_is_never_clingy_and_rarely_jealous_how/,relationships
115,Self repair by sleep?,"So I (23F) have a boyfriend (26M) for 5 years that sleeps any time we get into a bad argument. Literally, will just shut down stop doing whatever he is doing and go to sleep. 

It actually really pisses me off because it makes it seem like the repair of our relationship is not a priority. He just goes to sleep for God knows how long. I have never actually allowed it to run its full course, but he often will wake up like nothing happened. Once, he (not intentionally) ignored me for an entire night and I got so mad at him that I took away the cord for his Xbox. He still did not act like anything was wrong until like 2 hours after we woke up the NEXT MORNING! I was positively fuming. 

We haven't had a lot of issues really in a while. I'm settling into my career and he has a job that doesn't take too much of his time and energy. Well I've been extremely bored in the relationship lately. He just wants to play video games and hates going out to do anything. I get so bored just sitting there. I mean, I will do my own thing and I like video games, but I don't like them to be every part of every day. We have had multiple relationships about this multiple times and I brought up this past weekend that our relationship wasn't going to last because it is boring. 

Well today I told him I was bored and I wanted to do something with him. He got irritated with me because I had said I was bored before but nothing really came out of it. He previously asked what I wanted to do and I said okay a fun game. No response. So when I said I was again he said ""DO SOMETHING THEN"". I said I wanted to do something with him. He said rudely that I never answered the question before, which is somewhat true, but he hates playing Mario games and these are the games I like best. He then got mad at me once again because I didn't instantly set up the game...? He didn't even respond. Anyways, at this point I was so annoyed I didn't even care to play the game anymore together. I said to him that ""this relationship is f*cking boring and I hate being in it"". He said a small response like ""ok"" then turned off his game and is now sleeping. WHY ARE YOU SLEEPING!?

We are planning a big move, but sometimes I wonder if it's really worth it. There really is nothing to do around us, but I'm fine going for a walk or window shopping or going on a picnic. He doesn't want to do any of that because he thinks there aren't any pretty sights to see, or like to look at things when we aren't buying anything. 

I guess my main question is why the actual f*ck does he just sleep when an issue comes up? It makes me so mad and I don't understand it. 

TL;DR Told my boyfriend that our relationship is boring and hate being in it, so he just went to sleep. It's this normal to cope or wtf is this!? It's infuriating.",z347uu,0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z347uu/self_repair_by_sleep/,relationships
116,My boyfriend (33m) of one year is leaving and i (22f) cannot stop crying all day,"all day and nights are literally nightmares. i’ve been crying so much i have no tears left. 
story time, a mutual friend introduced K and me a year and three months ago. we started talking and immediately hit it off. i’ve been on many dates but i’ve never had a boyfriend, because i didn’t like anyone enough. But with K everything was different. we are both gamers and love anime and even though i’m an introvert we would talk for hours since day 1. in the past year there was not a single day where we didn’t talk. we never had any serious fights and everything was just perfect. 

he is incredibly understanding, kind and generous. he is beautiful inside and out. he knew i didn’t have much experience so we took everything slow. every date we’ve been has been one of the most memorable days of my life. we have the same taste in songs, movies topics and we are generally like a soul in two bodies. i’m hot headed and he is calm and composed and just perfect. no matter how much i try to pain a picture of this man for you guys it’s just impossible to tell you how absolutely respectful and pure this man is. we live in iran and it’s a horrible country to live in, so around ten months ago we both signed contacts with this lawyer so that we could move to canada. he has been rejected twice but i’ve never applied before. 

we both got accepted into the universities we wanted and even though mine was in toronto and his is in montreal we knew we could make it work. it’s a short flight or train anyway. he submitted his application for a student visa before me. (he is a doctorate student and i’m gonna get my bachelors)
a week ago on monday around 3 pm he called me, i was asleep and when i took the call he said his passport request (which leads to a visa) has came. 


the past few months has been incredibly hard for me and i was depressed. with the revolution happening in my country and all the things i have to do for a visa and everything i have been a total wreck. i also quit my job a few months back. i had problems with my abusive boss and i thought i was leaving so i quit. 
i don’t have many friends, i don’t currently work so he has been my everything and he has been so supportive in every possible way because of how miserable everything in my life has been. i also have an abusive dad and he makes me miserable and suicidal on a daily basis. 


so when i got that call it was like a bomb that was dropped in my life. i was already depressed and crying all day but now i absolutely feel like i’m dying. i haven’t submitted my application yet and i still don’t even have enough money and my dad being the absolute fucking jerk that he is, is making it so hard for me. he’s a millionaire but he does not even lend me the amount i need for a short while. 


this call , this fucking call has made my life not worth living. 


i can’t believe he is leaving for Canada in a month and i haven’t submitted yet. i can’t believe he is going on the other side of the planet and i might get rejected and stuck here with this crazy mentally sick man. i have been crying so much and yet i feel like i’m in denial. i can’t believe i will kiss him before he takes his flight and that will be our last kiss. i can’t believe the man that has been  the single best thing that has ever happened to me is gonna be in my arm’s length for less than 30 years. i can’t believe we are not gonna have awesome date. i can’t believe i’m not gonna watch him cook breakfast for me so passionately anymore. this man has been the support i’ve needed my whole life and he’s getting further and further from me and i can’t do anything about it. 


i can’t sleep because i’m so stressed and nauseous and overthinking all day long. i can’t eat i want to die. 
i’m crying as i’m writing this and cursing this fucking shit of a country that you have to run away from to have the basic human needs in life. 


this man. this beautiful man is gonna go and i will be all alone again. 
no more dancing or late night chats or calling me on his way home from work. no more singing my favorite songs for me when i’m sad. no more soft voices when i can’t sleep. no more cuddles with the man that smells like heaven itself. 


i can’t stop crying. i feel like i’m drowning. i can’t tell anyone how miserable i am. 
if i don’t get my visa i will have to live in one of the worst countries to ever exist, with a sick father who has been mentally and physically abusing me and my mom for over 20 years.
I don’t want to lose K. i want to watch rick and morty and laugh with him. i want us to play games in the same room. i want to call him so that he can pick me up and go out for absolutely nothing. i want to enjoy the silence and the deep talks with him. i want to share my deepest secrets and look at him smiling. no judgement. 


how can i ever get back to who i was when a part of my soul and my heart is gonna go? i need my man. he is my person. i want him and only him. 


i’m sorry i’m venting but i’m so devastated and i don’t have a grasp on my shitty life anymore.

117,My boyfriend's brother's girlfriend is ruining our lives and everyone but him can see it.,"So for context, my bf (18) has an older brother (21) who has a gf (19) that went to the same high school as me and got together with the brother shortly after me and my bf became a thing in 2020, so it's been 2 years for all 4 of us. Anyway, when I first met this girl, the brother's gf, let's call her Stacy, she was nice and bubbly, but there was *something* off about her that I couldn't pinpoint so I buried that feeling deep down. Throughout the first year, we got along and got closer as friends, and my bf liked Stacy too as it seemed there was nothing bad about her and she supposedly made my bf's brother happy. 

But with time comes more and more revelations and truths. What do I mean? Grab your coffee cause this is about to get juicy.

I slowly started noticing that Stacy was getting into more arguments with her bf, the older brother, more often, and that she was the one starting them. The basis of her point would be that she wasn't being given enough attention and that her bf would have to learn how to sacrifice boys nights for time with her. Funny thing is, the boys (which were a few cousins and their mates) didn't see each other all that often, and tried to make a thing called ""Sundays are for the boys"" as they'd be busy throughout the week and that day would allow *all* of them to catch up. Stacy's bf has a bedroom outside the house in a garage, so whenever the boys (and sometimes me and some of their gfs) would visit, we'd all hang out in there as it was spacious and outside away from the parents so we wouldn't bother them should we be loud. Stacy complained about how her bf should be spending more time with her, yet every other day, she'd come over from work and have alone time with him, but the second the boys came over, she'd complain about them being there and ask her bf to ask his cousins and mates to leave as she'd ask for ""alone time"" that specific day and it was unacceptable. 

Furthermore, the relationship was getting worse from there, and eventually, one of the brother's best friends, who happened to be a girl, was cut off by Stacy as she made her bf cut her out due to her claims that that best friend had feelings for Stacy's bf, but this was false and she already had her own bf who she's still with today. Not sure where she heard this ridiculous notion from, but it ""triggered"" her so much, and the funniest thing is, this best friend's bf is who Stacy was tryna go for way back in the beginning before she met her current bf, and to this day, still has a nude of that man's crotch for really no viable reason at this point. Now as a result, we all can't hang out with the best friend and her bf together because they're banished from the meetup spot which is the bedroom outside I spoke of earlier. Most of us see the banished couple out away from Stacy and her bf to catch up and talk trash because of how much Stacy's gotten on our nerves.

If you've read this far, I'm impressed and don't blame you, this is just the beginning. Fast forward a bit and Stacy and her bf had a big, big fight on a Sunday after them and the boys, including my bf, had come back from a christening, so Stacy had been with her bf *all day,* and she complained saying she wanted more time just for her and him together regardless that they'd been alone together the previous days. While we're all hanging out in the bf's bedroom talking, I notice Stacy looks upset and text her if she's ok. Few minutes later and the bf disappears, so I go to look for him and find him sitting in his car on the street out front and sit next to him and ask if he's ok. What I heard broke me as he didn't know what to feel which pissed him off more and he didn't know what to do to make Stacy happy, hinting at the fact that she wants him to change and if you love someone, you don't really ask them to change drastically. Eventually Stacy came to the car and I left them alone, reporting back to the boys what was happening. Later we all left to go get food, and we see Stacy and her bf walking back, the bf punching a metal wall in anger.

Fast forward again and they're having a fight again, like a huge one, and Stacy texts me saying she might break it off with him, but me being naive at the time before  she pulled the big guns on me, I told her everything would be ok and tried speaking to her bf to get his POV and spoke to her bout his side. She basically told me off for not ""focusing on her and her needs"" and how her bf doesn't attend to her needs and wants all the time. She states some ridiculous things about how he's not loving and shit, and the way the argument started was because the bf didn't know what more to do and said to Stacy ""here just kill me now then"" but he meant it as a joke and obviously wasn't serious as people say similar things all the time (eg: you're driving and you nearly get hit by an idiot and say to yourself ""i wanna kill myself right now"") It's an exaggeration. But she took it so personally and in the end, she accused me that I ""invalidated her feelings"" because I tried looking at both her's and the bf's side rather than focusing solely on her. You can gather from here that she's an attention seeker and uses anything to make an excuse to say ""that triggers me"" so she can get attention. I hadn't said anything bad to her and afterwards, she was distant with me. Basically she spoke to friends who only told her what she wanted to hear and not the truth, and I told her the truth. She thinks she has the privilege of entitlement because of some things she's gone through. Guess what honey, everyone has their shit to deal with, doesn't make you special. My father had cancer but I don't talk about it 24/7 or brag about something that could've killed him. My last grandparent passed away last year and I don't slide into the convo every chance I get just to mention it for attention. It's called shelving your agenda and basically not giving yourself entitlement for attention.

I could go into detail about other things she's done but I won't so I'll try to summarise it from here as best as I can.

Stacy doesn't allow her bf to go clubbing with the boys out of fear he'll cheat on her but she goes clubbing with girls and flirts with men for free drinks without the bf knowing. She especially goes on a rampage clubbing when she's pissed at her bf.

Stacy flirted with a man who turned out to be mates with her bf and my bf, not telling him that she's taken, and the second time she saw him at the club while there with her bf, she didn't say a word to him and pretended to not know him.

She barely acknowledges that she has a bf on her social media, which I get some people wanna keep private, but I mean nothing, maybe a highlight of the back of him, like she wants to look single. 

She's made me feel like a terrible friend and has ruined alot of nights when the boys come over, some with their gfs and we end up having to leave.

When her and her bf aren't on good terms, she's gone to a guy's house before late at night either alone or with a friend, and her own bf doesn't know who that guy is, making it look really suspicious. I'd only go to a guy's house that both my bf and I know, and most of the boys I know are mates with my bf so he trusts me.

She basically has her bf like a puppet and pulls his strings when she wants to, and because he doesn't have the best self-confidence or self-esteem, she's gotten in his head that he won't find another girl and that Stacy is the one, blinding him to the fact that he's copping so much for one person he doesn't need to. All the boys, their gfs, me and my bf, agree that if we can help him build himself up, he'll realise that he's so much better of a person than he gives himself credit for and that he doesn't need a girl like Stacy to do that for him as they're both literally stuck in an unhealthy relationship and he can't see that he needs to break it off because he's in love with her.

Stacy herself shouldn't have a bf as she has too many insecurities to count and until she's happy with her body and how she is, shouldn't be in a relationship. 

There's some other things she's done that we've all copped, and at this point, our patience is running thin, we're all fed up with her attitude and the way she treats my bf's brother, and we're hoping that they break up because as painful as it'll be, it'll be more painful for him the longer it goes on.

One day he'll find out about what she's done, but for now, most of us don't know how to bring this up to the surface without looking like the bad guys and before anyone says anything, it's her. Not him. Girls can be toxic in a relationship too, and she's literally draining the life out of her bf.

What do I, or our mates do? Do we sit the bf down to tell him everything? Do we set up a scene where the man Stacy flirted with at the club talks to him and sees her walk in and he reveals it was her he flirted with without the knowledge that she's taken? What the hell can we do? I can't stand to see them going on like this. I love my bf's brother like he's my own brother, and it hurts me to see him stuck in a relationship like this. I especially can't imagine how my own bf feels, seeing his own brother deal with that shit.

Stacy doesn't like me at the moment but I've lost all cares to give, we all have, I'm not putting up with her crap anymore cause she doesn't deserve it and I know one day they'll break up because we can all see what it's doing to the both of them, especially the bf himself.

119,Need advice asap,"I (28f) am in a exclusive dating relationship with this guy (30m) since mid-September and I met him in august. I had gotten out of a 12 year relationship this year after being engaged for 3 years. I told from the start that I’m not looking for any serious relationship and I don’t want to jump into the dating scene anytime soon. However, we clicked. 

From the first time we hooked up, it was a huge red flag. Long story short, I went to his apt, he cooked dinner, watched a movie, we had sex, and when I was about to leave, someone was knocking on his door and wouldn’t stop. The knocks got aggressive and the person was screaming. Turned out to be his girlfriend at the time. He never told me he had a girlfriend. But during that situation he wouldn’t tell me who it was since there’s no peephole on the door or windows to see who it was, so I told him to call the cops so they can tell the person to leave since their violently banging on the door. However, he already knew it was her. Cops came told her to leave. But he never opened the door for the cops. After waiting a few hours, I managed to escape. I was scared, hurt, and I’m still traumatized about that situation cause I imagined different scenarios that could’ve played out.

The girlfriend never found out I was there and he broke up with her that weekend. He had said he’s been wanting to break up with her cause he was not sexually attracted to her anymore. He also admitted that he has cheated in the past as well. 

However, he reached out a week after it happened and my stupid ass started communicating with him again. I knew I should’ve avoided him but I had feelings for him. We started bonding for those few weeks and he said that we should be in a exclusive relationship beginning September. I agreed. Since we started hanging out more I noticed he had anger issues and got upset at the most simplest things which scared me. 

Then we had a talk and said we shouldn’t be in a exclusive relationship but a week after we got back in it. 

That first week of the second time we became exclusive, I hooked up with a guy I met that summer. We didn’t have sex. Just made out and gave him oral. I regretted it because I was not into him like that. But it was my first time back in the dating scene and my friends convinced me to keep my options open. 

After that past, me and the guy I’m exclusively dating have gotten closer. But one day, end of October, he looked through my phone while I was showering and found the texts from the guy I hooked up with. He got extremely mad, I was terrified.  It was a whole different side I haven’t seen. I didn’t admit to hooking up, he got upset cause I met up with him and didn’t tell him. He wanted to read the whole convo but I didn’t let him. He then wanted to track my location from then on.  

Weeks past, and I woke up in the middle of the night to him in the bathroom with my phone. He found my deleted texts and recovered them and read it. I still denied about hooking up. He got upset caused I lied and deleted texts. The texts were innocent but had mild flirting. Also, I had stopped talking to this guy a week after hooking up. 

Few days later we were fine, then again he gets into his thoughts and he gets upset. He said we need to talk and it’s going to be uncomfortable. He says he knows for sure I did something even though I’ve been denying it. I have a huge feeling he messaged the guy on Instagram and asked him what actually happened. 

We’re supposed to have this talk later today. I’m scared he will become violent when he gets mad. He says things he doesn’t mean, screams loudly, and punches the wall when he gets really mad. I noticed lately he has been able to manage his anger. 
I also know there has been red flags since the beginning. We talked yesterday and he asked if I’m willing to go to couple counseling. But we’re not even bf/gf. 
Should I just admit what happened that night. Should I stay or should I leave.  Idk what to do. Advice?

Also, he thinks I did this as a way to get back at him from what happened with his ex. 

TL; DR 
With a guy I’m exclusively dating, red flags from the beginning. He went through my phone and found out I hooked up with someone in the beginning. Should I admit?",z2oito,6,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z2oito/need_advice_asap/,relationships
120,I (37M) feel like a small comment made by my friend (36F) has completely changed our relationship. I feel lost.,"I have a friend who I have known since we were both teenagers (which at this point is about 20 years). Over the years we have remained close friends through lots of big life events and changing relationships/changes to our extended friend group. I’m also reasonably close with her husband to the point that I have helped them move home/redecorate and have spent countless christmas/new year/birthdays & vacations together with them both.

At this point in my life I can count my close friends on one hand and if I’m being honest - I was probably closest with her out of all of them. 

Around 18 months ago we (My friend, her husband and myself) were up late drinking and chatting after a party at their place. My friend was decidedly more drunk than either me or her husband (which is not uncommon) and we were generally joking around and laughing. I don’t remember exactly what was being said at the time but at some point my friend said to me “You have a huge chip on your shoulder because you didn’t go to university!”. At the time I just laughed and moved the drunken conversation on to something else. I seem to remember being puzzled by the comment at the time but I brushed it off and moved on. 

The next day and in the days that followed I thought back to that comment and what she might have meant and it really started to bug me. What behaviour have I shown that made her say that? Why was that even in her mind? How long has she thought it? Do other people think this about me?

It’s true that in our close friend group (and the wider group) I am one of the few that didn’t go to university. Furthermore, both my friend and her husband have achieved a lot both academically and professionally. This was not something that I had ever considered as a thing that separates us in any way. Quite the opposite in fact, I had always considered us to be incredibly similar and all able to relate to each other as equals with similar backgrounds and upbringings. Even if I didn’t quite end up as ‘successful’ as them etc. 

The second part of this, which I think has gone on to make the problem worse in my mind, is the fact that my friend is quite a gossip. Every time I see her she will always tell me all about what’s happening in the lives of all of our friends and the extended group. Often those details are quite scandalous and private. For some reason, over the years, I had always just assumed that due to our closeness I was not the subject of similar gossiping when she spoke to other people in our friend group. Or even if I was discussed, it wasn’t in such harsh terms or with her divulging the private things we might have discussed. 

Over time, since she made the comment, I have had this growing feeling of worry over what they really think of me and more so whether that is the type of thing that she discusses with others when gossiping about me. It has bothered me to the point where I started avoided seeing them or attending events that I would normally would have gone to in the past. 

I am now less responsive to messages and emails from them, and the amount that we actually see each other has reduced considerably. This is all through my own evasion and lack of response when they try to contact me either directly in the group chat. Initially this was easy because of Covid but now it is much more noticeable and I’m forced to put it down to being busy with work.

In the last year I have probably seen them 2-3 times and I usually take days or even longer to respond to any messages. I feel like I’ve lost my friend and I no longer have anyone I can really confide in in the way that I used to with her/them. In the past I would have seen them at least once a month but now we barely speak. 

I know this is my own doing and the obvious solution was just to discuss it with her… however the problem as I see it is that this was such a minor comment I would feel ridiculous even bringing it up. Also I feel like my response has been completely disproportionate and I would feel quite embarrassed to admit that such a comment has affected me this much. In addition, she was very drunk at the time when and likely has no memory of saying it at all. 

I don’t know what I’m looking for in terms of advice but I’m just angry with myself for letting it get this far as well as feeling quite confused and sad that I seem to be losing one of the most important friendships I have ever had and they don’t even know. 

If anybody has any advice or has gone through a similar experience I would love to hear it. 

[TL;DR! My closest friend said I have “A huge chip on my shoulder about the fact that I didn’t go to University”. I now worry about whether this flaw is something she speaks about with other friends behind my back. I worry that our friendship isn’t what I thought it was and have started to avoid seeing her. I feel sad and lost from no longer having this close friend to confide in.]",z32yaz,1,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z32yaz/i_37m_feel_like_a_small_comment_made_by_my_friend/,relationships
121,How do I tell my husband I want my job back?,"Together 17 years. Married 15 years. No kids. 

I am incredibly goal and career oriented. My husband is not. He likes to chore and take care of me and the kitties. He does an amazing job.

I'm the opposite. I love to work, go to school, and further advance myself. There have been times this has been a detriment to our marriage because I get so focused on work that it is all I do or talk about. 

About six weeks ago I picked up my dream job. I went to school for social sciences - to help people. So for the last six weeks I've been running a homeless shelter. I absolutely love it. It's challenging, I get to help people, and I really get to make a difference. 

But the hours were long. I was on call 24/7. Literally fielding 10+ calls in my off time. I noticed my husband feeling down so I asked him what was wrong. He expressed how much he hated me working here because I was always at work. I quit the same day. My husband and his happiness meant more to me than a job ever could.

122,My boyfriend asked why our parents have not met each other yet,"My boyfriend and I have been with each other for a little over a year, and everything is going great. I met his parents at their place after dating for 5 months. He met my parents the same week. 

We join family dinners at each others parents houses very frequently, because we all live in the same town. My parents espescially often request visits from me. I think I am the only one of my siblings that regularly ask them how they are doing. 
All of us, (me in my apartment, him at his apartment, my parents at their house and his parents at their house) all live an estimated 10-20 minutes apart from each other, almost forming a perfect pattern on a map. I feel at home at his parents house and he does at my parents house.

The only ""problem"" is that our parents have not met yet. I did not think of it as wierd until my boyfriend asked why they had not met each other. Apparently his parents wanted to meet mine.

I actually kind of like our families being different entities that have nothing to do with each other. My parents are a different kind of breed, if I may say so, and I was actually very relieved when my boyfriend ended up liking them. I like to control when, where and how often, and with whom, I spend time with them. My boyfriend thinks they are cool (lmao) and does not understand my relationship with my parents. I love them and see them often, but they are a bit strange.  For information, I am not alone about thinking this; my siblings almost never have or have had visitors over, or visit themselves. My enganged sibling has only let our parents meet her fiancé's parents one singular time, and that was not at all on my siblings initiative. I don't really know my aunts, uncles or family home neighbors because my parents don't have any relationship with them. Growing up my parents never befriended any of my friends parents.

How do I tell my boyfriend that I don't want our parents to meet or form a relationship without it sounding crazy? I need help with how I should formulate this. I fear he might think that I don't see a future for us together.  

I just think I would feel suffocated or embarrased if we all became a sort of big family living so close to each other, especially with my parents not being that good at relationships with other adults, even relatives and family.

123,Is this a red flag worthy action?,"Is this a redflag?
I'm a Hong Kong 19 yrs old female in sophomore uni. Texting a male Asian American, he's working.


TLDR: I've been chatting with a guy that tricked?me about his age? I am still unsure if he's 45 or 22.

 Now he's a jokester and we get each others humour, but his grandpa jokes has confused me to the point I am unsure of his real age. This has caused me to have reservations on what to say and how to present myself in front of him. He's been leading the conversation mostly by his flow, and things gotten flirty. I was never the one that initiated this. But now I'm worried to get my hopes up or give up.  

He initially stated he was 22, but then kept going with the grandpa jokes.
For the past 2 weeks I have been under the impression he's 45, until he's back to saying he's 22?

Please help, I'm so confused, is this some guy humour that I didn't get or something?

124,How to navigate between families for the holidays?,"My husband (29M) and I (29F) just got married this past June and this will be our first holiday season as a married couple. To say we are stressed is an understatement. 

For context, I am an only child and he is one of three siblings. For the the past 8 years, our families have gotten along and we’re able to spend the holidays with each other. There were hardly any issues when it came to holidays. However, our mothers can get weirdly jealous and upset over the most petty of things. 

Over the last year, his sister decided that she didn’t like my choice for a bridal party and started drama (saying how she doesn’t like me or being around my family, saying horrible things about us) which has been a huge stressor and has led to me being NC with her. There were many many other family issues as well from both sides during the planning process. Then, at our wedding, there was a huge blowout between both sides of our family (his sister, his mom, his cousin, my two aunts, and my mom) which led to our families being NC with each other going on 6  months now. I hate to say this, but as much as my husband and I love each other, it has really effected our relationship. We are constantly trying to please our own families while getting in disagreements and arguments with each other. We are aware of this and try not to let it happen, but unfortunately it does.

We have lived together for the last 4 years, and every year we have hosted Thanksgiving and Christmas with our families to avoid the drama of having to split the holidays between families. Now that no one is speaking to each other, the stress of navigating the holidays is blowing up. Each of our families has decided to host thanksgiving dinner this year. We have decided that we will evenly split time between families. We chose 2-5 with his family and 5-8 with my family. Unfortunately, when I told my mom our plan, she decided that she is going to have dinner ready at noon (which she never has in the past, it’s usually always later) and that we can come later to eat (but made sure to mention the fact that her and my dad will have eaten by then) or on another day altogether. I’m instantly feeling the guilt from my mom and it has started an all night argument with my husband and I about our plans. 

How can we go about handling this? I don’t want to be feeling dread and depression when it should be happiness and bliss during our first married holiday season.

Edit: My husband did not tell me or ask for my input when he set a time with his family, which has added to our argument over the situation. He said that he thought that since my family has usually eaten later in the past, that it 2-5 would be an okay time to be with his family. While I don’t disagree with the fact that my family always intents to eat early but usually eats late, I am upset over the complete lack of communication with me, which could have alleviated the situation a bit.

So I brought up wife my wife in a conversation something like ""you don't still message that guy nude photos right?"" She responded that she hasn't been, ""but if he offers money then...""

I said I thought we agreed that wasn't necessary anymore because I make enough money and it's not healthy for our relationship. She kind of shrugged and dodged the issue. 

I eventually checked her phone again and found texts back and forth where he's calling her ""baby"" and asking her for pics. Saying very descriptive things about what he's do to her, etc. She was responding how she wishes she could have sex with him, etc.

What do I do at this point? I'm still unsure of if she's still just goading him along for money but also at this point I've expressed on multiple occasions that she shouldn't be doing that anymore.

128,My Girlfriend likes to hurt me. What do I Do?,"My (20F) Girlfriend (20F) have been dating for almost 1.5 years. I've never found anyone as compelling as I have found her. She and I share many values and future goals, and most of the time she is wonderful to have around. Sometimes we run into disagreements but I wouldn't even call them complete arguments. The truth is we don't really argue. It's more like one of us gets our feelings hurt and then we apologize and work through it. I think that's pretty good and healthy, we've never gotten into a screaming match. But there's something she does that I find a little concerning. Basically, she will enter moods where she's feeling, as she describes ""vindictive"". where she basically wants to hurt me and enjoys it. She doesn't like when I get too upset though, if I get too upset she basically hangs up on me and waits because I pissed her off or something. She hurts me by being dimissive, or saying stuff she knows will piss me off. But basically she likes when I look a little sad. Usually this only lasts a few hours so I tough it out, but for the last three days she's been like this. Unresponsive. Cold. Dismissive. And when I asked if she was mad at me she said, that that was an incorrect way to describe it. And instead, she just wants to hurt me, and for no reason.

Before she would respond very quickly, and with effort, you know how you can tell someone actually cares to talk to you. And we would be on FaceTime a lot, but not really talking to each other just doing our own things in each other's presence. These past few days she's called me just to hang up on me because my breathing was too loud. Telling me she was too busy to call. Leaving me on delivered for hours. And ignoring me when I talk to her.

So I'm at a loss. I feel like it's abusive, but I'm not sure. And I don't really know what to do. I'm really dependent on her as just a source of happiness. I was really torn up about it yesterday but now, well I'm just not sure about anything except that I really love her and I wish things weren't this way. 

So I just need some input, is it sufficiently abusive to bring it up? Is she just growing apart from this relationship?

129,I’m (23F) going on a date with my friend (22NB) and I’m terrified,"
To preface, I am very inexperienced with dating. I’ve only been on a date once before. And that was 4 years ago.

I started university in September to study a Master’s degree. I met my friend in the first week, and we’ve got super close after the past couple of months. Pretty early on it was quite clear that we both liked each other a bit more than friends - over time we’ve been spending more and more time together, we work together on all of our assignments, and we regularly just spend evenings watching tv together and kind of cuddling, sometimes holding hands.

There’s this stereotype about lesbians that they can make it clear as day that they like each other and still second guess themselves, and unfortunately in this case it’s been very true. Both of us are very awkward and have been completely refusing to acknowledge the fact that we’re into each other. The topic only came up because one of our friends was under the impression that we were dating, and when we realised this we laughed about it together, and then eventually very awkwardly kind of mutually asked each other out.

This was yesterday. We’ve agreed to go on a date in a couple of days. But now, apart from occasionally referencing the fact that we’re “dating” now, we’re still doing the awkward thing where we don’t know how to act. And I’m very anxious. I don’t know how to go on this date and make it feel like a DATE, and not just the two of us hanging out together like we always do. We haven’t kissed or anything since agreeing to the date. Whenever we talk about it we get really awkward and giggly and don’t know what to say. I’m not sure how to get past this - I’m so scared I’m going to ruin it before it’s even started. How do we go from friends to dating???

Tl;dr: we’ve been friends for two months and now we’re going on a date. But I don’t know what to do! How do I get over the awkwardness?",z30udf,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z30udf/im_23f_going_on_a_date_with_my_friend_22nb_and_im/,relationships
130,Should I hope for something?," There's a friend (m-22) that I (f-20) knew for +5 years. Back in april, I texted him to help me in my project. He then, asked me out for a coffee date! I honestly did enjoy spending time with him, even tho I didn't feel that spark but I was still feeling something. We went out to our second date, it was okay and nice but I honestly felt like he was expecting a kiss.. I just wasn't comfortable enough and he said nothing about it during the date. When we talked later on, he told me that he is more a touchy person but he understands that it may takes time and all of that.. I honestly just wanted him to be more emotionally open with me. To open up, vent to me, to just express himself and tell me whatever is on his mind! So after that second date, I noticed he became a little bit distant. I wanted to go out again with him, he said he wasn't that okay and we'd see. But then! We didn't talk for 2 weeks. no text at all. I got worried so I texted him. He said he's having some troubles and he'd talk to me when he'll feel better. A month passed, I couldn't wait anymore. I should not forget to add that he was even trying to talk with my other friend at the same time when we went on our second date... I honestly don't blame someone to talk with many person when dating... I mean there's nothing yet serious, no commitment no nothing. So I ended what didn't really start. It was a simple conversation, trying to understand what he's going through. He understood me, and understood my perspective. But I still didn't quite understand what's going on in his mind... After some weeks he texted me, he wants to apologize and to go have a coffee together. I first didn't say yes, but he asked me a second time and I agreed, but we both had exams. So we postponed it. But he didn't text me about it anymore like?? That was in july. And now! After all of that he texted me, saying he want to just check up on me. He didn't open any conversation, he only wanted to check up on me and if I'm doing fine.

Tdlr : He is a nice person, but I'm unsure how he felt about me. He's not emotionally open enough. I told him I'm no more interested 2 months ago. He texted me this week.

131,What do I do now? I feel a little stupid.,"I [16F] tried to become friends with one of my classmates [17F] but the way I did it makes me feel stupid and like a creep.

So, I’m not very good with talking to people that I’ve barely talked to before, so I’m usually awkward and can’t get a single word out. I wanted to become friends with this one really cool girl and I really was like excited at the possibility of a new friend. So I wrote her a note, saying this and saying how she was intimidating and I couldn’t say it to her face, but that I wanted to be friends with her. I signed my initial and just left it on her desk.

At first I think she thought it was her ex, so she said it was creepy (which I don’t blame
her for) I didn’t say anything then, and just prayed she didn’t find out it was me at that point. They were sat right behind me saying all of that too, and so I just sat there like an idiot, just regretting every moment of my life. I wanted to take it back so bad. But I heard from other people that she talked about it a lot, and I guess eventually she found out it was me.

A few days later I passed by her group and they were just pointing and laughing. I didn’t do anything and I’m not the type to just go up to someone and ask anything of them. So i just stood there and pretended I didn’t see them, and now I’m still just sort of ignoring that whole group. But god it hurt, because I’d always thought she was really nice and cool. And I wanted to be able to say more to her than 2 words and sitting there awkwardly afterwards. I feel like a fucking stalker and like a creep, but anyone I asked said I wasn’t, but I feel like they might be biased.

I want to get better at talking to people, cause otherwise I feel like a middle schooler writing notes to a crush or something. I feel like a child, when I’m really almost an adult. Who writes notes in high school? I feel like I just need to grow up, but it’s hard, and god my anxiety has always been through the roof and I’ve always had trouble making friends so It’s always harder than it sounds.

Is there anything I should say to her? Should I just forget about it and move on? Any better ways to just make friends?

It’s really just been on my mind a lot, and I just need advice from anyone who would say it bluntly and without being biased.

TL;DR - Wrote a note asking this girl to be friends, she originally thought it was her ex (called it creepy) but eventually found out it was from me,  laughed and talked about me behind my back. I feel like a creep, but I’ve never known any other way to talk to people that I’ve barely talked to before. I feel like a middle schooler, and I want to get over stuff like writing notes, but to me it’s harder than it seems. How can I move on from this situation? Do I say something to her?

132,"Sometimes I feel like all my(29m) wife (28f) does is nag, complain, or order me around","I was reading somewhere that one of the secrets of a long lasting happy marriage is that you say something like 4 positive things for every 1 negative thing. And it depressed me because my marriage isn't anything close to that.

I've considered making a secret tally during the day of what my wife says to me, because I feel like it would work out something like this. Majority, telling me to do things - ""can you get me a glass of water, can you get me a snack, can you do this, can you do that."" Usually nothing unreasonable by itself (though sometimes she'll ask me to grab her something she can't reach because she doesn't want to get up) but it's a \*lot\* of requests without much else communication.

Secondary would be micromanaging the things I'm doing. ""Can you get me a glass of water? No not tap water, filtered water. No not that cup, a different cup. No I wanted hot water, not cold water."" Meanwhile I'm going back and forth, going from ""I'm happy to do this thing for my wife"" to ""why doesn't she just do this herself,"" and usually I forget one of her commands because there are so many, which makes her more annoyed.

Next is complaining, about her coworkers, about her family, about my family (we have a 1 year old son and my parents are staying with us to help take care of him while we work), and of course about me and the things I'm not doing or haven't done or didn't do to her specifications. I've read a lot of advice on here and I know that a lot of the time women just want to vent without input so I usually try to sincerely listen and make her feel heard, but again it's a lot and I kind of get tired of it. It doesn't help that in a lot of the cases there are solutions to her annoyances or ways of thinking about them that would make her less annoyed but she doesn't want to hear any of that, she just wants to vent. Which is fine, but she vents about the same things over and over and it's tiring that she doesn't do anything about it.

There's also the nagging. This I go back and forth on because it's \*extremely\* annoying but sometimes I think I deserve it. I'm very forgetful and have trouble with procrastination and following through on things. I have a long to-do list which is very helpful but things still fall through the cracks, though usually it's small stuff. It's frustrating because it feels like she thinks I'm forgetting stuff on purpose because I don't care, when I feel like I have no control over what information stays in my brain (which is why I write important things down and set reminders). If this sounds like ADHD it probably is, but I feel like I have pretty good coping mechanisms. I'm never gonna have a perfect memory though and things will still fall through though, and she has to point out \*every single one\* no matter how small. And the thing is, it doesn't help me to do better, it doesn't help things get done better, it just makes me feel bad. But she can't help saying it.

And that's it. That's what we talk about. Otherwise she's either absorbed with her phone and online shopping, or she's focused on work and doesn't want to be bothered. Almost no other conversations about us, interesting things, funny things, our thoughts on things, our relationship, asking me about my day, mundane things, etc. We don't really talk otherwise. It didn't use to be like this, but it's gotten worse and worse. I feel like the issue is that she gets so focused on doing things, and things that needs to be done, that that takes up all of her time and exhausts her so when she does have downtime she just shuts down. And since she's tired she's always a little annoyed with me.

Also I want to be clear. I'm not a lazy slob playing video games all day while she works and cooks and cleans and takes care of the baby. I have a full time job (though not one as intensive as hers), I basically take care of all baby duties after work (happy to do this and spend time with my kid), and after he goes to bed I'm usually cleaning or taking care of things that need to be done. It's important to me to not be that kind of husband/dad so I try very hard not to be one, but I feel like I still get treated as one.

I've been honestly thinking about divorce, because I sometimes think I'm happier and even more productive when she's not there. That's a last resort because of our son though, I think trying to get back to a more open and loving relationship would be a better outcome if it's possible. I personally would even love to try couples counseling but my wife isn't very into therapy. So I don't know what to do. Maybe I just want to rant and be heard, because otherwise I feel like I'm gonna blow up at the next negative comment. And I'm caring less and less about her happiness because she's never happy and actively makes herself unhappy.

TL;DR My wife nags, complains, asks me to do things, and it doesn't feel like she talks to me otherwise. I don't think she notices she does this at all.",z309av,0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z309av/sometimes_i_feel_like_all_my29m_wife_28f_does_is/,relationships
133,LDR boyfriend lied for a year and a half about his living situation and now I'm losing feelings for him,"Hello everyone! I'm looking for advice on what to do with a partner who lied for over a year about his living situation. Long post ahead!

&#x200B;

I (f, 23) met my boyfriend (m, 29) through similar interests online. We have been together long distance for over 1.5 year. A month ago I moved halfway across the world to be with him. I was so sure about it, I left all my friends, family back home. It seemed like the timing was great.

&#x200B;

When we first started talking he seemed like a perfect friend and down the road we developed feelings. We spent hours and hours together every day on video calls. We met in person and spent 2 weeks together. I have always been super honest and open with him, because I have been hurt badly in the past. I told him all about it and how my greatest value lies in exactly that - being open and honest, communicating, not playing mind games, not reading in-between the lines... That was my main thing I was looking for and I was very clear about it always. And I have always given him that.

&#x200B;

First week after I moved here was pretty terrible. Stressful and sad. I felt strangely horrible. Like I sensed something wasn't right. So after a week we visited his parents and I found out he has been lying about living alone for the entire time I have known him and made up so many stories just to keep it a secret.

&#x200B;

He told me he lived in an apartment, was paying rent and had some roommates. He made them all up. He made up one in particular, told me about his nationality and how annoying he was. He lied about ""visiting his parents"" every once in a while. Made up that they lived a 15 minute drive away. Always muted the call whenever one of his ""roommates"" wanted to talk to him. Didn't tell me how his parents wanted him to be with someone else. And so on and so on. So many little lies 1.5 years just to hide that he was actually living at home, with his parents. And the worst thing is that he didn't tell me about it and I don't think he would if I didn't recognize his parents' place on my own (during our LDR he never wanted to show me the apartment he lived in because he was ""embarrassed that his roommates might see him""). He told me how he was embarrassed and even his friends didn't know about it. But now I found out all his friends knew, and I was the only one he lied to. So that was another lie right there.

&#x200B;

So now I'm questioning everything I have known about him. Because if he kept this a secret and lied about it since the beginning, I don't know if there is anything else he might have lied about. The crazy thing is I wouldn't even care about him living at home in the first place. The lying got to me so badly. I'm confused and hurt. It feels like he trapped me here in a way. Pretended to be an open book about everything so I would get here. It feels like I have lost the version of myself that had him and loved him. He still is a great friend but I can't feel anything more than that. I feel distant and cold towards him.

&#x200B;

He was the only familiar thing in this new country but now even he doesn't feel familiar anymore. Am I the bad person for slowly losing feelings and trust in him? Because that's how I'm starting to feel, I feel so guilty. But I just can't force feelings no matter how much I want to. Is this year and a half long lie a big thing for me to be concerned about? Am I crazy for losing feelings?

&#x200B;

And please be understanding, I have punished myself enough for being too naive and for going into this too soon and not cautious enough. So if anyone has any advice or thoughts on this, I accept it. Thank you <3

I've met my current girlfriend in university and we've been together for a little under a year; the spark used to be unbelievable, and we've been generally happy together. But I feel like the fire of my passion for her has decreased greatly. I feel incredibly guilty because I know that she really does love me a bunch, and I don't think she's even noticed my aforementioned decrease in passion for her... Conversly, there's this girl (23)-- let's call her G-- that I've know for approximately the same period, and we're okay friends, but I've gotten to know her alot more these past months, and I genuinley can't stop thinking about her; it's like I'm back in highschool the way hold this girl in my thoughts. I share alot more common interests with G than with my partner, and we're way more compatible on all levels. Neither one of the girls know how I feel about G, and honestly I'm not sure she feels the same way, but I like to think she might. Anyways, I feel extremely guilty about the whole ordeal and I don't want to keep hiding stuff from my partner. I must make-up my mind and choose a course of action that's fair for all parties, and I really wish to hear your opinion, Reddit. So what am I to do?

136,I think me and my boyfriend should of stayed friends,"We started dating when i was 18 and he was 23. At the time i didn’t make much of it and thought it was a normal age gap. Now I’m 21 and we have been together for 2 years. He is very kind and nice to me all the time. He wouldn’t pressure me into anything and it was just a sweet and romantic relationship. And now I just no longer feel like it’s right. I don’t know why, but i wish we just stayed friends. I find it revolting that he could want me when I was that young. But still, my love is not gone and I love him, but just differently. We have so many nice memories together and he has made me so many cute videos of us online. I have plenty of pictures and just all sorts of things that remind me of him and i don’t want to say goodbye to all of it since it holds a very special place in my heart. Also Christmas is coming up and i know that he’s already started preparing other gifts, it would be so cruel to leave him just before the holidays since its always been the most precious time to us (not because of the gifts, but because it is our anniversary). I’m so confused and don’t know what to do, he hasn’t done anything wrong and the guilt is killing me. There is still hope that maybe we could rekindle the flame, but i am not sure. I feel like our relationship is more of a friendship. He initiates physical contact and I don’t reject him, but I wouldn’t mind it if there was no contact and just conversation. It hurts him since it is his primal love language. Still, I just cant bring myself to feel what i used to. 

TL;DR We have been together for a while and at the start it was wonderful, but now my feeling have changed. I still love him dearly, but I wish we were friends instead of lovers.

137,LTR (6 Yrs) (25M) and Lost,"I have been in a relationship for 6 years now and am now 25 (M). Was in a relationship throughout college and didn't really get to live the single life where I experienced hooking up and having casual relationships. Overall, my relationship is good and we are very compatible but I do feel some painpoints about the lack of freedom and personal growth that comes with being in a relationship. I also feel that there is a lot of sacrificing happening from my end to the detriment of my other relationships with family and friends (although I know that this time split is natural in a relationship). We are both the same age and now that we are getting older and approaching that time to settle down for good, a few thoughts have been haunting me.

1. Am I going to regret not having a phase of hooking up and casual relationships in the future? I am seeing my friends on dating apps and doing casual hookups when they are not compatible for a relationship - although I am noticing that they do get into a relationship when it does click. Would be interested to know if anyone has any personal experience with this and can provide some insight.
2. In my first few years in my twenties, I was so focused on career and thought that once that is stable (it is now), that I would be ready for marriage and that I would feel mature enough and have grown enough to feel ready. I think that in terms of maturity, I might be there now but I feel like I have much to learn about myself still. Sidenote - the money did not make me happier, although my girlfriend stuck by my side when I had nothing and we grew together. Important to note that if I do end up ending the relationship, I would not be interested in anything serious/marriage until mid/late 30s.
3. Just the overall freedom that comes with not being tied in. I travel a lot for work and I quite enjoy being able to be alone for some time and reflect and just do my own thing. Again, overall I am happy when I am with my girlfriend, other than the few one off arguments - but I do tend to feel smothered when I spend too much time with her without my alone time. I find that I grow the most when I am alone and am able to truly reflect.

I'm not too convinced that there is someone out there that is better for me - if I end this relationship, I likely will have a very hard time finding someone that clicks as well with me. These thoughts revolve around not looking back in the future and thinking that I regret not trying everything.

I have a hard time opening up to people about this topic so I thought that this would be a good place to learn from others experiences and life learnings. Overall, I am looking for advice from people who may be a few years older that have gone through something similar.

Thanks in advance!

138,Breakup with a good man?,"Please please read…

I have been in a relationship for a year now with the most perfect man. He is so kind and really loves and cares for me and treats me so well. I however for the past many months feel this feeling deep down that he isn’t my person. And it makes me heartbroken, because I have so much love for him as a person as he is the perfect guy. I hate that I even feel this way and am not head over heels back. I don’t want to hurt him so I haven’t mentioned to him that I feel he might not be my person. I feel guilty for feeling this way because its like you hit the jackpot these days when you find a great guy and I don’t want to throw that in the trash either. He wants to get engaged within the next 1-2 years. I do want to settle down but I want it to be with someone i am head over heels for. I dont want to waste his time either. although I have been as I have been going back and forth on what I should do. I want to fall in love and find someone I can feel those things for. I’m also not very attracted to him and being intimate turns me off sometimes. The hardest part is wanting to breakup for arguably no reason as he did nothing wrong. Has anyone gone through this and has advice?

139,When is it okay to reach out to an ex?,"My ex \[26/M\] and I \[25/F\] dated for 4 months but were casual friends for a year. I genuinely take full responsibility for us breaking up. As individuals, I would say we are incredibly compatible, however I made some poor choices in my life that led to him breaking up with me. I was struggling really hard mentally, having severe anxiety attacks, and suffering from depression. I was taking medications that altered my mood and was living in an abusive situation which made my struggles with mental health far worse. I was being harassed by a former friend of mine who would call me in the middle of the night threatening to unalive himself if I didn't date him.   


Our relationship was phenomenal at the start and I truly felt like I had met my soulmate. Things started going downhill when life took a turn for the worse for me. I'm not using those reasons as an excuse, I'm fully accountable for the things that I did, but I was a far different person than I am now. I was always too tired and depressed to spend time with him, and I was always in a horrible mood. We didn't really fight, I was just in a really dark place and it was starting to take a toll on him too, so he broke it off.   


I reached out to him a week later asking if he would reconsider, we had a pleasant conversation but he told me he just needed more time to heal, as our breakup hurt him badly. We haven't spoken for 2 months since. He still to this day checks all of my social media, likes all of my posts. I wanted to ask him if we could meet up and talk. I'm doing a lot better now. I'm no longer taking the medication and have been going to therapy. A selfish part of me wants the person that I was in love with back, but I genuinely would be happy to be friends too. But I don't know if reaching out now is too soon, or if I should do it at all.   


TL;DR: My ex and I broke up because my poor life circumstances and struggles with mental illness started to weigh down on him. I have since gotten a lot better, live in a safe place, have been going to therapy, and am overall a happier and better person. I want to reach out and initiate contact again but I don't know if it's too soon, or how I should go about doing it.

140,My husband (34m) is taking a much lower paying job while I'm on leave (30f) and not really budgeting for it?,"My husband was originally put on a performance plan because of his previous manager for unfair reasons, but he's doing well with the new one. He's burnt out and has been for a while, and his company is now on a hiring freeze, so it would be quite difficult to get an internal transfer. 

My husband started applying to new jobs, and he accepted one in a different field with much lower pay. The health insurance also doesn't kick in for 3 months, and we have an infant. He was interviewing for another, and he didn't really apply around once he got that one. Now he's going to pass the plan, and he has a good relationship with his current manager. He hasn't talked to her about how unhappy he is with the work he was assigned by his old manager. There is a risk he's going to be laid off in January, but he'd get good severance, which would give him time to look for something with better pay/would help us float until I returned to work.

I'm on unpaid maternity leave until September, and I can't return to work until then. We had budgeted originally with his current salary and could make that work, but we're going to be hitting our emergency fund pretty hard to stay afloat until I return to work. Now that we're going to be living on 1/5 of our salary left year, with a mortgage where we budgeted for making 2/5 as our worst case scenario, plus inflation and a baby, we really need to budget better. 

Still, he's talking about buying x and y (not too expensive necessarily, but more hobbies that won't really save us money short-term), and I told him that if he's going to take such a big pay cut, we can't be buying alcohol anymore, and when I agreed to let him buy one bottle of cheap wine with dinner (it's the week of the holidays, and he cooked something nice? I know that's not a great reason), and I found out after he bought 3 (not all for tonight or anything, but still).  

Given we made it work so I could take a year off for the baby, I feel a bit hypocritical saying he can't take the job (if I was miserable at work, he probably wouldn't try to force me to stay), but it's going to be hard. I've suggested if he can find a job that won't put us in the red, or wait until I return to work, I can be supportive of what he wants to do, but he wants this job. It's a state government job, so the benefits are good, but I don't foresee the raises he seems to think he'll be getting. And he hasn't shown that he's that serious about budgeting, to make up for our lifestyle change.

I'm an anxious mess over this, given we're never going to be able to build up an emergency fund like this again, we'll need daycare next year, one of the cars we have is getting into money pit territory, and the other is leased (the payments were low and easily affordable, but they're going to go up when we have to buy it out). He hasn't put notice in but plans to next week.

TL;DR: I'm on unpaid leave until September, and my husband is leaving his job for another, meaning we'll be making 1/5 of what we did last year. We've been bad at budgeting, and he doesn't seem to be making that many changes to spending habits, when we're already going to have to use a good chunk of our emergency fund until I return to work.

141,My (27F) bf (30M) had an odd reaction after I poured my heart out in a letter for his birthday,"We’ve been together for 7 months, at the beginning, for 2 months, we were getting to know each other, then for 3 months he used to be very expressive, over the top love bombing me, his eyes were filled with love, I was happy but mostly receptive, I didn’t engage as strongly as he did because it was early for me. Sometimes I would give him disclaimers that I might not stay and it used to make him so nervous and upset. Now for the last two months I started loving him more and more, but he grew colder, so the roles are reversed. He still works on the relationship but we used to talk on the phone everyday, now we talk every 3 days or so, and it’s too little for me because I just entered the intense love phase and he’s done with it. His birthday was yesterday, so I sent him a letter expressing my feelings because I’ve never been good at showing my emotions. I also thought after this letter, my emotions will be so clear for him and we can move on to a better place or it’s gonna fall apart, so this push is much needed. Before I sent it I asked him how he truly feels about me, he said the nicest things. When he read it he acted a bit odd, he was sensitive but also a little closed off. I asked him what’s wrong? He said “nothing, I knew this is what I’ve always wanted and hoped for, but reading it made me feel like it’s not real, I’m feeling a bit odd and in a state of disbelieve, maybe because I’m not used to getting what I want”… i was disappointed, but I told him let it sink in. Then I talked about how he’s been a little cold lately, and that it makes me have all kinds of thoughts, is he: (falling out of love, cheating, upset, etc)? he said there’s no reason and that’s just him, and he’ll try to talk more (he told me when we first met that he’s naturally aloof). he also said he’s always been the diplomat and and rational one in any relationship or friendship, but with me he couldn’t be that person, he said I’m the most rational person he knows, (I guess he was feeling out of character when he was too clingy and emotionally dependent on me at the beginning). After that we had a normal video call just talking and talking. Today we still haven’t talked or texted, and I don’t plan to initiate anything until he does. I don’t know how to perceive the situation and what I should do next.

P.s: we both have anxious attachment style

142,"My mom's best friend payed for my college tuition, how do I thank him?","My mother has had a best friend since childhood named Jack[56m], they were never romantically involved as far as I know. Well since Jack has never had any children of his own, he’s always viewed me as somewhat of a surrogate daughter. He’s always been willing to babysit, take me for a weekend, or spoil me rotten. In fact, mom and dad had to tell him one time to cool it with all the stuff he was buying me since it was making me spoiled. But he wasn’t afraid to tell me when I was wrong or to give me tough love. Nevertheless, I love Uncle Jack with all of my heart. I just wish he had his own children to love because he has a lot of it to give. 

I’ve been having a lot of financial difficulties since going to college as most do. Unfortunately, my parents weren’t able to put together much of a college fund, so I had to rely on loans. I was mentioning to Uncle Jack how broke I was, lowkey hoping he’d send some pizza money. He laughed and said I was totally obvious and sent me some money that could have paid for 10 pizzas.
 
Now I came home a little early this past weekend for Thanksgiving and Uncle Jack asked if we could meet after work yesterday. We met for dinner at our favorite restaurant and to my utter shock, he presented me with a check. The check was huge, he told me that it was to pay back my loans, pay for the rest of my school, any additional expenses like books or laptops, enough to buy a car, and even take a spring break vacation.

I was completely floored, I started balling my eyes out and I hugged him harder than I’d ever hugged anyone else. I asked him why he gave this to me, he said because I have tremendous potential and he doesn’t want to see me drowning in debt and wasting it in some crappy job. Plus, he’s sort of paying it forward, he wishes he has someone to do this for him when he was in college. He wanted to go to Ft. Lauderdale for Spring Break, but he just couldn’t afford it, so he swore he’d never let any of his future kids miss out. He just asked a couple of things of me, to always work hard, spend the money wisely, pay it forward if I can, and attend his funeral. He said the last one with a smile, but I knew he meant it. 

My parents were surprised as well, but grateful. I think dad is a little jealous of Uncle Jack being able to provide me with a free education while he hasn’t been able to, but that’s just a guess. Mom is going to take me to open an account tomorrow before the banks close.

143,how much of this are red flags? Girlfriend (29F) threatens me (30M) to meet other guys whenever we fight.,"She will threaten to meet other guys one-on-one for dinner whenever we have a fight.

I tell her, she needs to think of the reverse, ""how would she feel if I tell her I am meeting other females"". I won't do it or even mention the idea of it. Because that will make her feel hurt.

She also has been meeting a married man for a while claiming that they are ""just friends"". She claimed she doesn't do it anymore after meeting me.

She was meeting a married man and said that he took her to ""fun places"", and claimed that it was purely platonic. I was thinking how would his wife feel if she finds out. It could potentially destroy their family, especially if the wife has trust issues. I would never meet with a married woman on a one to one basis without the husband knowing. Even if the husband knows, that is a bit iffy in my books.

**TLDR:** Girlfriend threatens to meet other guys when we fight. And has no problem meeting other married men as ""friends""

144,I [F31] want to send my ex boyfriend [M34] an anonymous holiday gift? Does this sound as creepy as it feels?,"I was in a relationship with this man for 2.5 years. We had a pretty good, healthy, generally happy relationship. We finally broke up because I wanted to get engaged and he wasn't sure he ever wanted to marry anyone (his parents got divorced when he was 5, both went on to marry really wonderful people, and his two younger brothers are both happily married). We have literally not spoken, even once, since the night I broke up with him. Not even a text or a social media like.

I was--and still am--very close with his family. For example, his mom sends me christmas gifts every year and vice a versa, they all write me on my birthday, I talk to his sister in law every few months and I even sent his sister money for her first beer on her 21st. I love these people, they're a lot like me, and I miss them terribly. I don't think I realized just how much I missed them either until i've dated other people and met their families.

It's been 2 years since the breakup and I progressively miss him more. I don't know if it ever would have worked out, but I have regret. He was patient, laid back, liked animals, loved aviation like do, didn't like country music but would let me listen to it anyways, he compromised, he had a stable career he loved that paired with mine, he was a great traveler, he never raised his voice at me, and I miss so many things about him. So many qualities I can't quantify.

Anyways, he bought a house and moved since we were together (I know, because of his mom). I'm nosey, I typed his name in on google--up popped the address.

He loves star wars, and wild socks. When we were together, I always got him wild socks. One year I got him a star wars sock advent calendar, and he opened it all at once. It was a huge joke between us for some time, that he didn't understand how an advent calendar worked. I was in Target this week, and sure enough...they have the Star Wars advent socks again. I'm so tempted. How creepy is it if I send him one? Directly from Target obviously, with no note. Is it super creepy because he's moved?

145,Girlfriend's texting habits make me feel she's disinterested. Just overthinking? (25m) (22f),"Girlfriend is a self-confessed lazy/poor texter. I wouldn't feel this was too much of an issue if we were together most of the time, but our relationship is long distance.

We do talk each day. Both of us take turns to initiate, but some days I won't hear from her until 4-6pm and if I don't I initiate myself, and it does make me wonder about her interest level. We typically exchange only a handful of messages too until she laugh or heart reacts a message. We call while gaming 3-4 times a week on average right now. Most calls are around 2 hours, maybe once a week around 4, and on rare occasions up to 6.

Is any of this an issue at all? She says she loves me and misses me once every week or two, and in person she's incredibly affectionate. But texting her just feels more structured and difficult. Is a 'bad texter' girlfriend a thing or is it a sign she isn't that into things overall?

146,I (41f) just discovered that my son (11M) has an older brother that I never knew about,"So my son's father was never really in the picture. He left soon after my son, Jamie (fake name) was born. He's never had any contact or relationship of any kind with Jamie. I knew that he had another child from a previous relationship, Adam (also fake name) and since he let us, I've come to find out through mutual acquaintances that he also left this boy and never had any relationship with him.

I've recently found Adam on social media and found out that he lives in our city. Last night I told Jamie about this and he hasn't stopped talking and asking about Adam. Looking back I wish I had done a bit more research before telling Jamie since I really don't have much to tell him about his half-brother. He's 25, I think so there is a very significant age gap and I don't know anything about his personal life since his social media profiles are all private.

I've never really dated since having Jamie and he's never had any significant male role model so he's always latched onto older males in his life (teachers, my friends, etc.) so the thought of having an older brother is revolutionary to him. I do think that, if Adam is open to having a relationship with Jamie, and if it feels appropriate to me, then there could be long-term benefits to Jamie. As well, I don't think it's fair to hide something like this from Jamie. 

I've told Jamie that I would reach out to Adam but I have no idea as to how. What do I tell him? How do we meet? What should I expect from a potential relationship between Jamie and Adam?

Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

148,"My (F, early 30s) bf (M, late 30s) lied to me that he went to work but he went to a kink party last December and flirted with another girl there","
I recently found out about that. He did get her number, reached out to her, sent kiss emoji/flirty texts, and tried to arrange a double date right after but it seemed like the other couple couldn't make it so it didn't happen. However, he attempted to make that happened. He said she held his hand. They didn't kiss, but he had his arm around her waist/shoulder. At that time when it happened, we were 6 months into a committed monogamous relationship. Now it has been a year later and we have been together for 1.5 years. 

Aside from that, he also had an emotional affair with a female friend of his. It ended now (I hope). And he has a very loose boundaries with another female friend who either he calls her or she calls him everyday when I'm not there. They used to talk for hours everyday. Now he tries to cut it a bit shorter. He deletes calls/texts between them so I couldn't see. 

When I called him out on what happened at the kink party last year, he just made jokes about it then acted defensive and attacked me verbally. He did say a lot of unkind things to me and threatened my career (by making up lies about me to my employer). According to him, he said that out of anger when I told him I wanted to talk to a friend of his in the kink community who is polygamous, who introduced him to that girl and encouraged him to cheat to figure out what really happened that night between him and the other girl. He claimed that I threatened to destroy his life by saying I wanted to talk to that friend and that I am crazy. I have never been gaslit harder in my life. I feel so heartbroken. He apologized eventually for everything and promised to never do it again...but can I ever trust him again?? He told me I blew things out of proportions and that he didn't do anything that night. I think it's cheating. How is it not cheating to flirt with someone else and arrange double date behind your gf's back??

Currently we have been having issues with brother who is just impossible. He wont own up any mistakes, whatever we tell him to do, he just wont do it. He has some his beliefs about everything and wont change his opinion. He has been picking fights with sisters regarding clothes, mean comments about their cooking and so.

Me, and gf told them that we would be moving out if his behaviour doesnt change.

Sisters also joined in conversation regarding situation about brother and they support his moving out. The thing is, father wont kick him out because he thinks nobody should leave and work things out, but brother wont change his habits or anything, meaning he is defending brother.

We found 2 bedroom apartment, 500€ with utilities included. But thing is that if we go that way then after paying our expenses we would be living paycheck to paycheck, and baby due in March.

I would be okay with that but Im worried about money and I feel like horrible person thinking only about money.


Tl;dr; gf and I are living at my parents house and we are having issues with brother. We are thinking of moving out but I have concerns about money",z2pc1q,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z2pc1q/housing_and_moving_out_m28_f25/,relationships
150,Is there something going on with me [30M] or am I simply dating the wrong women?,"TL;DR: I find myself getting into relationships and then getting cold feet and losing interest. Is it because of my attachment style or am I just dating women that aren't right for me?

Hey all,
 
I'm 30 and I only started dating when I was 24 or so. In the last 6 years, I've been in a few relationships. Nothing long term. I've learned and grown a lot through dating and I've made mistakes that I've learned from.

**However, I'm starting to notice a pattern with myself that's keeping me from developing these relationships into something serious.**

I find that I will start dating, and after a couple of dates with various women I'll find someone where we seem to mutually like each other and continue dating. Throughout the dating, I'll be anxious constantly wondering about if they like me or not, and it ends up that most of the time I worried for nothing and everything was fine. (*after writing this and re-reading it, I wonder if the biggest issue lies here. Perhaps I'm so clouded with worry about them liking me, that I forget to make sure I like them.*)

I'll be completely infatuated with that person for a few weeks/months, hand-waving any red flags away, and I'll have stars in my eyes for them. Then, when things start to settle down and I get more comfortable with them, less worried about if they like me or not, and the infatuation starts to fade, my feelings do a complete 180 and I seem to lose a lot of interest almost overnight.

This has happened a couple of times now and it really, really worries me. Here's the current situation:

**I've been dating a woman for the past 3-4 months who is pretty great** - she checks a lot of boxes and is a better match for me in many more ways than any of my previous relationships were. At first I found her beautiful in every way and she was unquestionably desirable to me. However, we moved quickly and spent a LOT of time together over the past few months, and about a month ago I noticed I started to not really desire her anymore, I started to miss my alone time, I started to fear commitment, I started to question if I was actually attracted to her in the first place. I started to get a sour attitude, and started to get actively irritated by her wanting to spend time with me and talk to me. 

I recognize my own attitude and it kills me to know that I have it. She is a wonderful woman who does not deserve that, so I want to figure out why I'm feeling the way I feel.

The thing is, I can't tell if it's one of these:

* She is in fact a great match, perhaps one of ""the one""'s for me, and I'm just simply in a phase where I'm nervous about the future and if I get over that fear/concern we can continue dating happily (maybe it's an anxious-avoidant attachment style?).
* I'm genuinely not into her and she's not the one for me and I was just lying to myself when we first started dating because I enjoyed the attention and companionship, and now I don't know how to get out of it because I'm too deep and my sour attitude is a projection of me being frustrated at myself for getting into another relationship I shouldn't have. (If it's this, then maybe it's true that every woman I've ended up in a relationship was not the right woman for me, because I think most of my relationships I've ended up feeling some shades of this attitude. And then maybe I should spend more time dating to really find someone I'm really into before turning it into a relationship.)
* Something else completely.

Whatever it is, I want to figure this out because she does not deserve my hot and cold attitude, and I want to be better so I can end up with a successful relationship that moves towards marriage, children, etc.

Also, between my two parents, there are 5 divorces. While growing up I didn't necessarily have the best picture of what a healthy marriage looks like, and I want to make sure I avoid that in my future.

I have started going to therapy as well, and will dive into this with my therapist.

I would appreciate any thoughts y'all may have.",z2gi2x,8,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z2gi2x/is_there_something_going_on_with_me_30m_or_am_i/,relationships
151,Ex still watching my IG story after months of ghosting me,"
Long story short, me (28F) dated (29M) for about two months before I found out that he had a dating app. I confronted him about it and he never say anything. Basically he ghosted me, I deleted him off IG and we haven’t talked since. Fast forward, It’s been 7 months and I am enjoying my life a lot more, surround myself with people I love and doing things that I like. I have a separate ig account dedicated to fashion and lifestyle. Suddenly, he’s starting to watch all the stories I post there. I guess my question is why. He ghosted me back then and now wanted to stalk my Instagram?

152,I (19M) can't get over this girl (19F),"I'm still crying while typing this. I have no one to talk to, because the only one person I used to share everything with was this girl who I fell in love with randomly. I never thought I would become so obsessed with her. She was just a friend, we used to talk and often flirt in a friendly way. However, I started developing feelings for her. No one has ever made me smile on my insta notifications the way her texts did. I fell in love. I love everything about her. The way she is, her humour, her looks - I just stopped seeing other girls that way. I've so many friends - both men and women - but she is the only one I shared everything with. I shared the most vulnerable things with her, I told her things that I always thought I'd keep to myself only. My heart would start beating fast when I would see her. And she also knew I felt jealous when she talked about other guys. (And she often showed that jealousy too if I talked to another girl, alas just jokingly)
In fact, she started hiding about her recent crush from me by saying things like ""I no longer like him"", or ""I am over him he is mid anyways"". Until recently when her tone became really cold with me. She stopped texting me (I think I forgot to mention that we haven't seen each other in months now as we live in separate cities now), and when I tried texting she would no longer vibe the same way. I tried talking about her crush, to see if she talks about him to me in the same way she used to, but it was different. She started describing how she likes him a lot and is always thinking about him. 
I've accepted it from a long time that she will never feel the same way about me. It's just natural. And some things aren't meant to be. But the reality is too difficult to get over. I cry, every night, wanting her back. Wanting to text her again. And more often than not, I end up texting only to receive the same replies like you'd give to a friend you're not very close to. I can't get over her. I want to block her, but I don't want to seem petty. But I just know as long as things stay like this, I'll keep obsessing over her. And the worst of it all is I can't even distract myself because now no girl other than her seems attractive. It's just her in my mind. But it kills me. The more she mentions her crush on social media, the more I want to just disappear from this world.

So I just need some friendly advice from people here. How can I move on with life and forget her? I have already accepted the reality, I know we will never be together but I can't get in with life.

153,How do you know when you genuinely want a breakup vs when it’s relationship anxiety?,"My Gf (F 29) and I (M 30) have been going out the past 11 months.

Currently she is traveling southeast Asia the past 4 weeks, with another week to go, on holiday. She comes home for Dec and we go on a small ski trip, then she goes traveling again in January for 3 months in central America, with the potential for a follow up trip, or for her to move home - she doesn’t know her long terms plans yet, I’m a bit of a kite in a breeze as a result.

I’ve had a tough time the past few weeks she’s been away, missing her, companionship etc. she knows this. The next 3 months are looming and I think it will be even tougher. As a result I’m now considering is it a wise time to part ways, and if faith brings us together down the road, then great. Worth noting I’m also developing my own plans close to home, that don’t include traveling a bunch.

We’ve always generally got on well, had a few arguments the past few months, but share humour and some interests. However I’ve always had a nagging anxious feeling following our first 2-3 months that we’re not right for each-other in the long term. Now with the looming trip, the nagging has gotten bigger.

I’m not sure if this is just anxiety, as I’ve tended to have it a bunch in this relationship during periods of significance, or a genuine desire/belief that we should break up.

There’s lots of further context for how we’re different/similar, some have led to conflict previously. Some differences include difference in desire for children, interest in travel, timelines, approach to planning a future already; but we share humour, chemistry, good sex, outlook on general morality and life.

I tend to try roll with any punches, and my inclination is always to do so, but I also don’t want to self impose hardship for the sake of it, so am trying to find the best course forward - especially in light of her travel plans. I care about this girl and don’t want her hurt, but at the same time, I do need to self preserve.

How does one determine whether something like this is just anxiety about the relationship or genuine good rationale for taking a break?

154,"(24m) Cheated in previous relationship, am I now a huge red flag in dating?","Im a 24 year old guy and got out of my first and only relationship a little over a year ago. It was an incredibly toxic and unhealthy relationship that I shouldn’t have stayed in, but I had major self esteem issues and my desperation to not be alone was too strong. At the time we only saw eachother at weekends, one day when we were apart I made a stupid mistake and let’s say ‘inappropriately messaged’ with 2 random girls I met through reddit. I stopped it real quick once I realised what I was doing and felt absolutely horrible, next time I saw my girlfriend I came clean, made no excuses for it and apologised profusely. She forgave me and we moved on and we later broke up for different reasons.

Although I never slept with anyone else or planned to meet up, it was still an act of infidelity that is inexcusable and I feel terrible about it to this day. My question is do I have a moral obligation to tell this to any new girl I start dating? And how likely is it that this will send them running for the hills?

155,Should I (30F) just let him (30M) go or try one more time? When I feel so anxious,"We've only spent 4 weeks in person since we are from different states. Early on I already began feeling he was not as consistent as I would need. He blamed it on knowing we were going to be apart and at the time choosing his career to focus on.

We tried to be long-distance a few times over the last 6 months, but I always ended up feeling like he could not meet my needs and broke up. The saddest part of it all is we truly love each other, deeply. But every time I'm back in this relationship I am a nervous wreck and can't do anything else in my life properly. His inconsistency triggers me, he feels its all distance-related but I'm not sure. I had had relationships before where I don't feel anxious. It feels like he would be emotionally there for a few days, and then distant for a few other days, and I hated it. 

We broke up a month ago, but we just spoke again, he is willing to move to my city, in February, but he wants to come to spend December with me. Should I let him visit and give him one last chance? I want to but it makes me extremely anxious, and since we have talked about this I am feeling like its not the right thing to do. I feel like I've begun to heal from the breakup and to some extent, this feels like opening up the wound again. However will I regret not giving it a chance, or will he just hurt me again?

Until I caught him cheating on me with his male best friend. I am so hurt and disgusted, I can’t believe he would do this to me.

All of the signs are there now. He is emotionally distant, affection is unappealing to him, sex is unappealing to him, he is more touchy with his male friends than me, he is dismissive of LGBT topics. 

It all makes sense now.

Redditors, I wonder what to do now? Should I try and fix the relationship with him or break up? Any additional steps? There are so many options to choose from.

157,(27M) after 5months she's not "in love" and we're breaking up," 

Hi guys!

I'll try to make the long story short :

last weekend my girlfriend met some very good friend of her, leading to discussion about our relationship, and leading her to realize that our relation is not as ""intense"" as she'd like to, and her feelings for me not ""love"".

we had the discussion last night, at my place, and after 3 hours we sadly decided that we should stop seeing each other.

personnaly my world felt apart, for the last 5 months I really thought she could be the one, we shared a lot, had really good time together, even an amazing holiday 2 weeks ago. I had nothing against her, and neither does she against me.

I already noticed that she wasn't as ""expressive"" and ""enthusiast"" as me, but I was thinking this was just her way, and maybe that'd come over time. The truth is, she wasn't on the same page as me. (another sign was not introducing me to her friends/parents, despire them knowing my existence).

I'm really sad to let her go, but I'm not sure continuing like this would make any sense, faking it or waiting for the situation to change one day or the other ... that'd also requires her to be ready to invest herself more and take somes risks maybe.

The only case I'd consider is her getting back if she really changed her mind, realizes that she's doing a big mistake and that her friend influenced her... I could also get in touch in a few weeks to know how's everything going, as the decision to break up has been made very quickly ...

Happy to gather your thoughts on all of this. Does a relationship need to be very intense for the very beginning for both of us to be happy and for feelings to develop overtime ? I believe everyone's different.

I'm also thinking about that ""intensity"" thing, I'm pretty sure texting a lot every day led to this. The emotion level is always the same, there's no down (when no texting) or ""up"" when we met or do something... 

Thanks

159,Wife [31f] feels I'm [29m] unattracted to her due to pregnancy (5 months) and cries.,"Initially I found her budding baby bump to be insanely sexy and we would have sex very often. I guess after a while I ""got it out of my system"" and now I'm feeling more of an urge to make her feel comfy.

Whereas before I would find her ravishing and proposition sex often, right now I feel like I want to chill out rather than have sex. Over the past few weeks, I've been tired or literally not in the mood for sex and my wife sees this as me no longer being attracted to her because her belly has grown too much.

We've had multiple conversations in which I explain that I still love her and find her attractive, but I simply don't want to do it as often as a few weeks/months back, and she's cried several times because to her, regardless of what I say, if I don't want sex as often as before it's because I've lost attraction.

Sometimes I've given her oral, but I wasn't in the mood for PIV, and this makes her feel temporarily good, but then a few days later she'll say she feels distant from me because we've been having less penetrative sex. She's also anxious I'll be even less attracted to her after birth.

To be clear, we're still having penetrative sex at least once a week. I don't think we've gone 7 days without PIV since she got pregnant, with some weeks being a bit more intense than other, the latest ones being on the less intense side. 

I feel like we've had a thousand conversations about it, and she always eventually reverts to insinuating I'm losing attraction for her regardless of what I say.

How do I get her to understand?

**tl;dr:** Wife feels I'm unattracted to her growing baby bump and that makes me want sex less often with her. That's not true but we have been having sex less frequently. No matter what I say, she thinks I'm losing attraction for her and will lose more after birth.

160,I’m lowkey in love with one of the bartenders at a club I regular,"Okay, so I (19 almost 20F) am VERY fond of this bartender (34M) who we’ll call Marcus. This club is basically my second home, I’m there every night they’re open and even go when I’m sober. I’m friends with all the staff including the owners and am even trying to get a job there cause I love it so much. 


But recently I’ve accepted that I’m lowkey in love with one of the bartenders there. It started pretty innocently, I’d always order my drinks from him so we grew close-ish and I’d always get a hug from him when I got there and when I left. He gives the best hugs so tight and secure like he didn’t wanna let you go. Anyway, I’d always joke “awe I love that man”, or “I’d sell my soul to him”, etc but in a friendly joking way.
I also started visiting him at his other jobs more recently cause why not I love to see him.


Anyway, the other day I was out playing pool with some friends after having a drink at one of Marcus's other jobs (he also used to work at the pool hall and this is relevant to the story) and Marcus shows up at the pool hall after getting off work. He does his rounds and says hi to everyone the usual.


 Now I'm not good at pool so when he comes to my table and watches me take a shot I get so nervous I can feel my face go bright red cause I don't wanna mess up in front of him. Luckily I made the shot and the other team scratched so it was up to me to place the cue ball and sink the 8 ball. Marcus helped me place the ball in the perfect spot, he placed my hand in the right spot to support the poll and showed me exactly where to hit it to get the 8 ball in.


 At this point, I'm literally pissing myself cause I'm so excited that this interaction is happening, and yes I did sink the 8 ball thanks to his help.


 So today when I went to visit him at both jobs he'd say things that just made my brain go BRRRR. Stuff I feel like I wouldn't have paid as much attention to in the past or made a big deal about. Like at the end of the night he even paid for one of my drinks and that's the first time he's done that. Maybe I'm overthinking it but maybe I'm not.


But like you probably saw at the beginning me and him have a 14 year age gap which I feel could make things tricky down the road. I really do like him a lot but I find it hard to try and properly connect and get to know him cause cause of this. I feel like I might misinterpret some of the things he does because of the age gap and I’m not sure how to talk to him the same cause he might not get what I’m saying you know?

If anyone has advice on how to go about this situation that would be lovely

TL;DR
I (19 almost 20F) really like this bartender (34M) but am unsure how to go about it. Our age gap is quite big so I’m not sure how to go about connecting with him on a deeper level then just hanging around him and visiting him at his jobs. I wanna make it kinda obvious I like him but I don’t want it to become weird or awkward if he doesn’t feel that same cause I am very much a regular at the club he works at and I’d be quite sad if something happened cause I do love him either way.",z2y0n4,0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z2y0n4/im_lowkey_in_love_with_one_of_the_bartenders_at_a/,relationships
161,I(26M) have been getting mixed signals from my straight friend(20M),"So it all started with me seeing him on Instagram as he was an influencer from Germany who would model clothes and take professional poses in popular clothing both from well known brands and upcoming brands in Europe stuff that other European IG models would wear. He had a really decent following like 20K followers he grew by himself and he had a talent manager as well later. I thought he was so cute and was originally interested in him. So I would comment on his pictures all the time and he ended up noticing me out of all of his ""fans"" and followers. A lot of them being girls who thought he was the hottest boy they have seen he even had that middle part hairstyle that looks like Leo Dicaprio in 1996 in Romeo + Juliet. He had a lot of fan girls who just wanted him to follow them and I thought it was so cool that he noticed and followed me out of everyone. I didn't think I was special but I did model clothes myself on my IG so I guess since we had something in common he liked me and followed me. After that we messaged eachother every now and then and I would send him heart eyes emojis when I thought he was super cute in his stories which he would like. Im from the US, Chicago to be specific and I just recently came out as an openly Bisexual male. I decided to go to Germany for my vacation also hoping to see him. When I got to Germany I ended up hanging out with his friends who I made friends with because he introduced me to them. I had the time of my life they treated me like family letting me sleep at their place and taking me around their town to do really cool things. At first he was so busy because he just started his new job getting done with school. But he agreed to meet with me for a day since he wanted to see me and was super excited as I was too. He told me to take the train and he would take one as well to meet in a town close by his home since where he lived was kind of boring so he took me to a town that was interesting. We hung out the whole day and I gave him my gifts a lolipop and a t shirt he loved since we were both into fashion. We ended up going to a rave at night dancing and getting drunk. We had so much fun then had to go back to our trains to get back home. When we left he decided for us to take a scooter to the train station I said I didn't have any money left so he bought the scooter and told me to hop on the back. It was those electric scooters you had to stand up on so I held onto him with my arms wrapped around his waist tightly and my head laying on his back for comfort since we were both really drunk. At first I was so nervous because I liked him and didn't expect to get this close to him the first time meeting me. It was at night and we were both feeling good and it was an amazing experience riding around the city with someone I had feelings for holding onto him it was so romantic to me at the time. Also earlier that day he felt so comfortable around me that he put his arm around me when we were walking and it made me blush ngl. He also kept dropping his wallet on the ground and having to pick it up around my crotch and I was nervous I was gonna get a boner around him and he dropped his wallet and keychain around 3 times the last time he looked at my crotch area and asked me what pants I was wearing and they looked good. I was really flustered after that anyway after I had left him and we said our goodbyes I was on the train crying in my drunk state because I had developed major feelings for him and I wasn't sure if he really liked me back as I felt a lot of mixed signals. After that we would message each other almost everyday and send eachother gifts through mail. I would send him American snacks and he would send me German snacks his child hood favorites. We were getting super close and for Xmas I sent him a poster I made of a drawing I did for him. The drawing was a digital one of him looking like his favorite anime character Killua from Hunter x Hunter. It was so good and it looked just like him mixed with Killua it even had his hair eye color and birth mark and his clothes from his clothing brand he started. He loved the poster so much he hung it up on his wall in the favorite part of his room. I also sent him a Killua plushie which he loved and took a pic of him snuggling with it shirtless in bed saying he loved it so much. I also wrote him a heart felt letter telling him how much he meant to me and how me and him were like Gon X Killua and he said the things I wrote him about me and him being Gon X Killua were so cute and sent me the  ? emoji and saying he loves me. He even pinned that letter up on his wall and showed it to me saying it will be were he can always see it on the favorite part of his wall in his room. That stuff made me really confused about us and I was not the only one. Since we talked almost every day and every week all of a sudden he stopped and didn't talk to me for like 3 or 4 weeks which really hurt me and broke my heart. I tried reaching him but he never even seen my messages. Then finally he answered and told me he was so sorry he wasn't able to talk to me and said he should have contacted me because he cares about me. He said ""please don't think that I don't like you I was just going through a lot and I was also very confused about us"". He said he didn't want to hurt me and he felt so bad and wanted to make it up to me by calling me and we talked for hours. He also said that if I came to Germany again I could stay with him at his house and if I came during the winter that he would teach me how to snowboard. Ever since then we still talk almost every week and he always asks me when we will see each other again in person. Then he said he was trying to save up money so he could come and see me here in the US as i invited him to stay with me. He would always talk about when we saw each other again we would do so many things ""together"". It really made me feel more confused about us. And the more I tried to pull away from this he would message me and make me develop feelings for him again. He would tell me how much I mean to him and how he is so lucky to have me in his life. I am doing a little better now but I admit I still do have feelings for him and would honestly just be happy to see him in person again. I told him how we had so much chemistry the first time we met in person and he agreed. We still talk to each other a lot to this day as I just talked to him a couple of days ago. I am trying to live my life and let him live his even though I do get mixed signals from him every now and then and when I do stop thinking about him he wants to talk to me since he likes me.

162,Relationship with gf(24) fell apart because I lied,"I (M28) was dating and this girl and we just got into a relationship. We were seeing each other for 4 months. In that time I lied to her about my age, I said I was 26. She found out from someone else my real age and was furious. She broke up with me. 

I apologized and we patched things up but she no longer wants to be in a relationship. She said she wants to be friends and still wants to talk on video call, meet up in person, and and wish each other good morning and night. She says we could revisit the relationship 6 months down the line. 

She still cares but doesn’t want to be in a relationship. She had taken away the small things that I enjoyed in the relationship like my pictures of her, pet names, and the romance. It feels as if she’s punishing me. She had shown me pictures of guys who are texting her and told me she’s meeting up with a guy friend this Wednesday. I’m still holding on that we will get back together. 

TLDR; girl (24) broke up bc I lied about my age, I’m 28 not 26, she wants to stay friends and says maybe we can go back to the relationship in the future.

163,Long distance date/relationship between i (27m) and 38f went completely sideways.,"We started texting and it got flirty real quick. After a month she visits me and everything went fine. We planned her second visit and so she visited me again 2 weeks later. All good during the second visit so we sort of confessed our feelings. Planned the third visit before she left to go back home. After a while I noticed that something was off when we texted each other.

She told me that she had a minor breakdown and that she wants to continue visiting and speak on the phone but that she is too exhausted to do so. She explains that her feelings are the same but that she needs space. Important detail here is that she works 2-3 days a week 3 hours per day. She also previously mentioned that she has ADHD but I didn't think anything about it. After this we still continued to text and she showed interest, until one day when she took even longer to respond and without the same affection as before.

I could see her writing with other people on an open forum on the website we first met. You can see who visits your profile on this website so I just visited her and sent her a mail asking if she got my messages. She responded with that she doesn't feel like having her phone ready all the time. I said ok. Same day during the evening she didn't wish me goodnight. Next morning I was online on the website and then she messaged me that she doesn't like that im ""checking"" her and that she needs space because she's both mentally and physically exhausted. I apologized and then we both went no contact for 3-4 days. 

I sent her a regular phone message asking how she's been and she says that she has thought a lot about the situation and that she wants to call it quits. The relationship takes too much energy but she doesn't know what we should do, she says. I tell her that I noticed that something was off after she stopped texting me. She says that she has thought a lot and that it isn't kind of her if she can't live up to the expectations of a girlfriend and that it has nothing to do with me. I tell her that I want nothing more than for her to feel well again and if we could speak more about the whole thing on the phone. She responds with that I'm cute and ""maybe tomorrow"".

Then she asks me how my night out was last friday and I said that it went great, I also told her about my week but she didn't respond. Later the same night I ask her if she's awake and she still doesn't respond. She is however, texting with people on the website. The next day she messages me during the afternoon saying that she knows I don't mean anything bad, but that it seems like I haven't listened to anything over the last couple of weeks about her situation and that she can't take it. 

The reason for this was because I visited her the night before on the website and she felt ""hunted"". I only visited because I was worried and also because I know I have trust issues from past experiences. She then says that based on everything that has unfolded that we don't fit together. I got extremely confused and said that we haven't even known each other for 2 months. She said it didn't matter and that we also are too far apart, not just geographically. 

She also mentioned that this wasn't because of me prior to this, but now it was. I asked her if we could take a break and see if things could work out in the future. She responds with that she doesn't believe in breaks because they still mean a certain amount of responsibility = stress. I accept her stance and tell her that I wish for her to be healthy again. She thanks me and that's it.

She has now blocked me and removed me from social media platforms. I feel guilty and confused over the whole situation. Could I have done something differently?

164,Family disapproves of my relationship and I'm caught between a rock and a hard place," I don't know anywhere else to go and my current situation is eating me alive, so I'm turning to you for support and advice...

I (32M) am currently in a 3 month relationship with a girl (34F) that has made me feel like I've never felt before.

When we spend time together time flies, we've talked hours and hours about everything in life (and are aligned on most important topics), our intimate life is just mindblowingly amazing and we've travelled together for 1,5 weeks where we only had 1 small argument over the entire trip. I've completely lost my heart to her and she's also madly in love with me and we both feel like we've found what we've been looking for our entire lives.

About a week ago, we both decided it's time to meet the family (parents and siblings). I met her parents (+sibling) first and everything went really well and her family welcomed me with open arms. Everything I'd imagine regarding my future in-laws (well-educated, kind and good set of values).

However, on my family's end, it did not go the same way and unexpectedly took a turn for the worse. Even though we're from the same cultural background and country, have the same religion (orthodox Christians) and share many common values, my family can be considered more conservative than her family.

One day after meeting her, I sat down to discuss my future plans with her and it was then when they (parents + sibling) expressed how they disapproved our relationship based on some of the following arguments they had:

\- Her being older than me (physically I look younger, she's got more emotional baggage, having children will be more difficult at her age)  
\- Her being an IG influencer (having some pictures that are provocative on her page *-> this point was worrying me as well and she's aware of it*, travelling for during weekends, consumes lots of her free time, etc.)  
\- Her having lived her 'good' life and now trying to settle and rush me in having kids since her biological clock is ticking with a guy that has it all (good paying job, the right looks, my own place and car, etc. etc.)

I've discussed these various points with my girlfriend - since we share literally everything - and she basically said she'd do whatever it takes for us to be together (saying that being an IG influencer is a hobby and she's ready to give it up if it means saving the relationship, talk to my parents to calm them down about the age gap, have a sit down with our 2 families together to work out our differences, take some distance from the intensity of our relationship to give it some time for my parents to realize we're not rushing into anything, etc.).

However, my parents (incl. my sibling) have seemed to made up their mind and are telling me I'm about to make another mistake and refuse to accept her in my life.

\[The mistake I mentioned in the previous paragraph\]: I've been married for 6 months with another girl a few year ago and they're scared I'm walking into another major mistake. They've decided to intervene this time and voice their concerns, because last time they basically let me make the final call (against their parental advice) on what to do.

\[TL;DR\]

I've become extremely anxious, barely slept, have a troubled stomach and feel physically sick these past few days because of the situation. I have never felt worse (not even with my divorce or any other romantic relationship) because I believe this is the first time I actually love someone and it hurts thinking I might never see her again. At the same time, my family means everything to me and they've supported and been there for me while reaching any success and facing any misfortune I've had in life and can't imagine losing them.

Anyone had a similar experience? Am I too much head over heels in love and should I look at it rationally and take time? Or should I fight and just go for it?

I' m really lost and feel like I will lose anyway regardless of the choice I make.",z2nnjq,0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z2nnjq/family_disapproves_of_my_relationship_and_im/,relationships
165,How do I tell my ex-girlfriend that I don’t want to date again?,"I (44f) broke up with my girlfriend (46f) about 8 months ago after dating for about 2 1/2 months.

We didn’t talk for a while but started messaging recently and have caught up a few times for a cuppa or a casual meal. After such a short relationship and long time since breaking up, I thought this was just as friends.  

Recently she said she would like to start dating again. I said that I only wanted friendship and thought that’s where we were heading. She said our regular messaging meant to her that we were rebuilding our relationship. I said friendship was all I could offer. She suggested being friends-w-benefits. She was upset when I said no and told me to leave. We had a similar conversation again via text and I stated I didn’t want a relationship and could only offer friendship. 

I thought that would be it but she’s now messaging me again as though nothing happened. I’m replying with short polite answers. If I keep replying I’m concerned she’ll think it means I’m rebuilding the relationship (not just friendship). 

I can’t get my head around her still having feelings for me and this _looks_ like ordinary friendly chitchat but I missed the signs before.  

Do I need to cut contact or just find a better way to communicate? If cutting contact is the way, how do I say we shouldn’t message or catch up for a while because I’m concerned she’ll think it means more than friendship without sounding condescending? All the alternatives I’ve come up with sound bad in some way. Do I need to talk to her in person or is text ok? 

I know this should be simpler than I’m making it but I was really sick for a few years, am not fully recovered, and it’s affected my thinking. I’m having trouble working out what to do and then second guessing myself. I’d love some guidance on how to do the right thing by both of us.


TLDR; I need some guidance on how to communicate to my ex-girlfriend that I don’t want to date again.


ETA: Thank you so much to each of you for taking the time to comment. I really appreciate it and have tried to respond to all comments because they’ve really helped open my eyes in this situation but also made me realise I need to re-evaluate other parts of my life. 

I got pretty tired early on but wanted to reply to everyone before bed. I hope my comments make sense but if not please know that I have taken on board every comment even if I have to give it some more thought.

166,I need help accepting my (22M) gf's (23F) past,"Please read the whole thing before you pass any judgement please!

I (22M) have been with my gf (23F) for 4 months now. She was in a previous relationship for 5 years and ended things with her ex once we started talking and getting to know each other. I wasn't in any previous relationship and she is my first one.

I know what I'm about to say is going to sound shallow and selfish but it's been nagging me a lot lately and it's something I genuinely want to get over because I love my gf and see a future with her.

When we first started talking and getting to know each other I knew she was in a relationship and she had a sexual life before me. This is something I thought I would be able to look past and accept (not that her having a previous partner is wrong or anything) but lately it's been bothering me a lot more for some reason. We have an intimate relationship and the sex is good and we both communicate what we want. But the fact that she had sex with another person still bothers me for some reason even though logically I know it shouldn't. I am not insecure at all about her having a previous partner nor am I jealous of him, so I don't really know what my problem is, but if someone can give me some advice, that would be greatly appreciated.

167,Should I tell her I like her?,"So I (M 18) just started college this semester and I've met a girl (F 19) that I like. She's the first person I have been attracted to since I broke up with my ex (4 months ago). We are getting along and spending a lot of time together. She's currently in her hometown because of Thanksgiving and we have called a couple of times since she's been there and she brought up me coming and spending a couple days there with her (it's a 4 hour drive) and I want to let her know that I like her so she doesn't find out some guy is sleeping on her floor that likes her afterwards. I don't know if she views me as a friend or something more but I'm scared to let her know how I feel about her in case it ends up with her feeling weird about being around me and we get distant. Should I tell her as soon as possible over the phone or wait until she comes back so we can be in person when it happens?

I know this isn't very organized but I've been thinking over what I should do for the past few days and it's causing me a a lot of anxiety. 

TL;DR - I like this girl and she invited me over to her house to spend a few days with her and I don't know how to tell her I like her.

168,I feel like my [30M] girlfriend [27F] broke my trust and boundaries when we were exploring an open relationship when we first started dating. It's been six months and I think it's still affecting me. What can I do? (X-post r/relationship_advice)," My  girlfriend Claire \[27F\] and I \[30M\] have known each other for nearly  four years, and started seeing each other on a casual basis in February  this year.

I knew immediately that  I really liked her and wanted to have a committed relationship with  her, so I asked her if she would like to date seriously in April. She  said yes, and I was elated.

I knew  that Claire had been seeing another guy (let's call him Connor) on a  semi-serious basis. As I was to be relocating overseas for work for a  couple of months in May, Claire and I agreed that we would be okay with  us both seeing other people on a casual basis (including Connor) while I  was gone; and that when I returned to the country I would like to be  exclusive. This suited me pretty well as I've been in long-distance open  relationships before, and I thought committing to a relationship with  me would be a less difficult prospect for Claire to confront if she  didn't have to break things off with Connor completely.

We  didn't talk too much more about the topic, other than that I said I  would ask if I wanted to know any details about the sex Claire was  having without me. My total intention of our open relationship was that  it was to take place after I left, and that we'd still be exclusive  while I was still in the country.

I  don't recall if I explicitly said that or just intended it, and as you  probably just guessed, this is where the story gets messy.

Claire  and I seemed to be on the same page, and the next weekend Claire told  me that she would have lunch with Connor to tell him that her and I had  started dating, and she would only be seeing Connor on a casual basis  from now on, if he still wanted to see her.

I  was quite anxious about this meeting prior to the weekend and I recall  asking Claire if she would not sleep with Connor that weekend. Claire  and I were messaging that weekend, and she said nothing happened between  her and Connor except that they only met for lunch, and he took the  mini break-up well and said he might like to continue seeing her  casually after I left. Claire told me she was emotionally exhausted that  night and was staying with a friend for an early night.

A  couple of weeks after I had left the country, I found myself having no  desire to sleep with other people as I was more than happy to wait a few  more weeks to see Claire again.

I  messaged Claire this asking if she would be happy to remain monogamous  until I returned home, at least for a short time while we established  our relationship and connection again in person.

Claire  returned my message telling me she didn't want to be monogamous until I  returned - firstly because she had already arranged to meet up with  Connor again, and secondly because she had wanted to keep sleeping with  another guy that she had been seeing casually (let's call him Matteo).

I  thought Claire and I had been super open and honest with one another  previously, and she didn't seem to have hidden anything about her  relationship with Connor, so I was really confused and a little shook to  hear that there was another guy involved too (Matteo).

I  asked when the last time she slept with Matteo was, and she was  intentionally very vague on details, but when I pressed her and put two  and two together she admitted that she was actually staying at his house  the night that she told Connor her and I were dating.

I  was honestly quite devastated to hear this - I was so wrapped up in  Claire that it didn't even occur to me that our understanding of  exclusivity for the last few weeks before I left the country wasn't  mutual, that she had been having sex with a guy that I didn't know about  at all basically right up until I left the country, and most of all  that she had totally concealed this from me.

I  made it clear that I was really upset about this - although Claire was  initially really defensive about sleeping with Matteo, she eventually  agreed that she had broken my trust and that sleeping with Matteo wasn't  a healthy thing to do for our relationship.

Claire  justified it by saying he had been trying to see her for weeks and she  had started to feel bad for avoiding him and had run out of excuses to  give him not to see him, that she was in an emotionally fragile place  after breaking things off with Connor, and that there was no emotional  attachment there whatsoever. When I asked how she thought I would have  felt if I knew she was sleeping with Matteo that weekend, she told me  she didn't think it would hurt me, only because she didn't think I would  find out.

I accepted this and I  told her forgave her for pushing the boundaries of our relationship - in  my opinion - way too far. I asked if she could stop seeing Matteo and  Connor because I felt my trust had been completely broken. Claire was  initially super resistant to this and reacted quite combatively (she  accused me of changing my mind and telling me she ""didn't want to go  from an open to closed relationship every time I changed my mind"") but  eventually agreed to remain monogamous when I told her I didn't want to  continue our relationship if it wasn't monogamous.

I  had been making what I thought was a decent amount progress in moving  past this since a lot of time has passed until last week when I found  out through a mutual friend that she had also slept with Connor that  same weekend that she slept with Matteo (before telling Connor about her  and I having a relationship and asking Connor to see her more  casually).

She directly told me  nothing sexual happened between her and Connor that weekend, so finding  out that isn't true has thrown me for a real turn - my heart has been in  my throat when I've seen Claire this past week.

I  also found out that it was Claire that was instigating meeting up with  Matteo, and not a reluctant meet-up as she had described. I feel like I  could have forgiven her sleeping with Connor that weekend in isolation,  but as the situation with Matteo unfolded the way it did it now feels  very difficult to look past what feels like another breach of trust.

Even  though this was six months ago and Claire has mostly been a really  great partner since then, I have had such a hard time getting over this  sequence of events.

I accept that I  left the door wide open for her to sleep with other people by not being  clearer boundaries when we started dating, but ever since then I have  felt soooo insecure. I can't get these events off my mind, and  constantly think of how imbalanced we were in terms of wanting  exclusivity, how quickly she seemed to be able to obfuscate the truth  and turn it around on me, and how readily she seemed to be able to act  in what I think was a self-centered way at the cost of my emotion.

Since  then I have had trouble seeing Claire as a good long-term partner and  it has absolutely affected the quality of partnership and the amount of  energy that I have had available to commit to our relationship. It makes  it feel hard to be vulnerable and authentic around her as I feel wildly  insecure that my feelings possibly could get disregarded again so  quickly in the future if I don't live up to her expectations. I don't  think Claire would cheat on me, but I am still so insecure about a  future with her now.

Tell me  Reddit, what can I do? I think Claire is a great girl and I don't want  to break up with her, but instincts are telling me to end things with  her as I can't see my trust or feelings of security ever fully  recovering, and I just feel like the relationship is slowly  deteriorating on my end because I can't let these insecurities go.

Am I letting my insecurity take hold of me if I break up with her, or do you think what I am feeling is valid?  


TL;DR: My girlfriend was reluctant to be monogamous at the start of our relationship and did some things that I think were unethical. Six months later it still troubles me and I can't figure out if there's a resolution or if it's best just to end things.",z2d7iu,5,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z2d7iu/i_feel_like_my_30m_girlfriend_27f_broke_my_trust/,relationships
169,Thoughts on HSV,"Hi guys,

So I (28M) have recently been dating someone (29F) and this past weekend, we went to her place after a date. Things got frisky and she ended up going down on me. The next day she texted me saying she developed a cold sore. I have tested negative for HSV1/HSV2 since my last relationship (2019, yes long ago) and haven't been with anyone since.Now I'm freaking out worrying about having genital herpes. I have not had any symptoms as of yet (this was 2.5 days ago) but am extremely stressed out about the implication this would have on my dating life. I have only been with two other people (ex girlfriends) and now I worry that no one will date me thinking the worst. I had reassured her she did nothing wrong and that it is really common as I didn't want her to feel a sense of guilt. I have read it can appear after two weeks so I am very keen on examining myself to know and will get tested in 3 months (to allow for a sufficient antibody response as well as to know which strain).

For those who do have cold sores/genital lesions, how do you cope and how do you approach telling future partners? This is really stressing me out and I don't know who to talk about it to (I don't want to tell the girl I am dating that it's stressing me because I don't want her to feel guilty or judged because she truly didn't know)

Would you continue seeing this person if she was asymptomatic at the time? Should she have told me before going down on me?

TLDR; asymptomatic date went down on me, she had cold sore next day, how long until symptoms and how to cope?",z2g4ql,3,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z2g4ql/thoughts_on_hsv/,relationships
170,Guy (25M) I (29F) went out with ghosted and then posted a picture on insta stories that I’d sent him and hid it from me but I found out from another account,"
I (29F) went on a holiday to Bali and went on Hinge to find someone to have a one night stand with or something. I wasn't looking for anything serious as I was only staying for a few weeks and there's no point looking for a relationship, however open if I potentially meet someone that could develop into something else. 

I match with this guy (25M), we started chatting on instagram and he seemed super interested, a lot of talking going on, him being funny and sending selfies etc. A few days later we went for dinner. What was meant to be a one night stand turned into me thinking this is someone I could potentially like. We seemed to have a LOT in common. Plus I was SUPER attracted to him. We went to my place and had lots of laughs, we didn't have sex but fooled around a bit which I think made it more special. The next day he goes back to his hotel and messages me a few hours later for us to meet. We meet at the beach, go for lunch and then join his friends who were surfing. We spend the whole day together and then around 5pm he drops me home and we agree to meet for dinner because it was his friends bday and that he'll text me. I found him to be a bit distant and acting strange but I shrugged it off. A few hours go by and he hasn't texted me with the dinner informations so I text him and he replies a bit cold, I get a gut feeling something's off, but I go to the dinner anyway since I liked his friends and I was alone on the trip anyway. 

Dinner's finished, he offers me a drive home and I ask him if he wants to spend the night and he agrees. But he doesn't kiss me or barely touches me and when I try to make a move he pulls away, I asked him if something was wrong and he said no and kissed me on the forehead so I just accepted it and go to sleep.

Next morning he's leaving for another country in a few days so technically it would be our last day. He gives me a few kisses and cuddles and we say goodbye. I felt sad because I wasn't expecting to feel a connection with him as I usually don't with most people and now I probably won't ever see this guy again. I posted a pic later on on insta and he liked it. And then, after a few days, I posted another one and he didn't like it but I also noticed he wasn't posting any more stories and I went on to my business account (call me psycho if you want) and realised he had blocked me from his stories AND posted a picture I sent him as if it were mine which I found super strange. Why would he block me if he didn't want to be with me anymore? To me, I'm indifferent if I don't like a guy, I'm not gonna go out of my way to hide things from him simply because I don't care about him, so I'm super confused. And I felt a bit hurt as well. I apparently got it all wrong and whenever I feel like I have a connection, it's not only one sided, but the person apparently despises me and I'm still not sure what I've done. 

This year my dating life has been a mess. I can't seem to get at least one person to go on a few dates with let alone develop something and when I start moving on from whatever person, they come back. I've had an ex from EIGHT years ago come back this year and still to this day messages me. I've got guys in my DMs who ghosted me or only ""used"" after I seemingly moved on and even ignore them, yet when I want them, they treat me like shit! It's so exhausting. I'm tired of playing games. 

I'm at a moment in my life where I'm working on myself, pushing myself out of my comfort zone, like climbing a volcano or learning how to surf lol, I've stopped indulging in drugs and alcohol and party like I used to in my early 20s as an escape for my anxiety/depression. Also when I was younger these “games” seemed more fun, now I just find it stupid. I now turn to nature, exercise and healthy eating. I'm at a stage where I'm really loving myself but seems like I have no clue how to put aside how a person treated me. I've let this guy I met on this trip mind fuck me and even more so after seeing he blocked me on his stories but still follows me. It's ok not to like me, but going out of your way to blank you? I felt hurt. How do I cope with this? How do I not let it affect my self esteem? Because I sure know he's not worth it by now.

171,My bf (28M) "betrayed" me (23F) by playing WoW with another guy,"This is my first ever post here, English is not my native language so I'm sorry for any mistakes beforehand.

So I (23F) and my bf (28M) have been dating for more that a year, we both love playing video games, usually we do play together. Recently (maybe 4 months or so) i started playing WoW with him. I've been really enjoying playing Shadow Priest (damage class) while he needed healer for arena 2x2 (PVP), therefore i respeced to Discipline priest for it. For past 2 weeks I've been asking him to play arena with him and guess what.. we didn't, because he either went to sleep early or electricity was off (we live in Ukraine). 

So first argument was when he went arena 3x3 even though i was waiting whole day for him to play with me. He answered simply that guys have been waiting for him and he didn't know even though i was asking him for a week.


Another argument we had - he doesn't want to give me his WoW account even though he has mine and sometimes plays on it.
The breaking point was on another day when i found out from his friends that he changed his specialization to healer in order to play 2x2 with other guy and didn't tell me for weeks.
That sounds stupid af, but seriously, I was buying all this healer pvp stuff not for him to respec and play with another guy. I feel betrayed, he didn't apologize and speak to me since i called him while crying about my hurt feelings and his lies.


TL;DR: my bf was playing 2x2 pvp in WoW with another guy and even changed specialization to healer in order to play with him, while i was waiting and also change specialization just to play with him 2x2 (he asked).

Am i overreacting? He seems to dgaf. Any advices?

UPDATE: We broke up. The reason is not WoW, obviously. The reason is he didn't care about my feelings. He said he want chill girl (who I normally am), without any childish offences. He expected me to go chill about me waiting him for a week for 2x2 specifically and going 3x3 without me.

172,Guy I’ve been seeing said it’s up to me if I want to continue the relationship,"I (20F) really liked this guy (23M). We’ve been seeing each other for about 5 months. We instantly clicked and when we were together it was so fun and good. He makes me feel good and forget about my worries. But he literally does the bare minimum and I know that we are on different paths in our lives. A lot has also happened too that’s sus and that hurt me a little but for some reason I just can’t ignore this connection we have and Ik he’s felt it too. But he also has a lot of issues that I feel like he does not deal with. 

Two days go, I had a conversation with him about stuff that’s happened and After that He said he couldn’t give me his time bc of some things with his family and his life goals (don’t feel right discussing what he said bc it’s pretty personal) and that it’s up to me if I still wanna talk to him or not. But that he didn’t expect to wait for him to get his shit together. I didn’t even say anything proper I just said okay and didn’t even ask what he wants. Why didn’t I ask him if he wants to continue what we have or if he wants me or not. I didn’t think I’d be this hurt. 

My dilemma: 
I don’t know if  he’s gonna reach out to me. Is him giving me that option his way of kinda ending things and saying he doesn’t want anything? Or is he genuinely giving me a choice and still wants to be with me

 Do I reach out to him and try to make this work or is it not worth it?

173,My(27F) boyfriends friend(30sM) tried to sabotage our relationship - trying to move on?,"So my boyfriend(31M) and I have been together about a year and a half. I’ve met his friend group and really get along with them. I consider them my friends too at this point. 

A few months ago one of his friends, let’s call him Josh, lied to me to try to sabotage our relationship. He told me that my boyfriend cheated on me and gave me “evidence” such as dates that he hung out with this girl. He heard it directly from my boyfriend but had no other proof. 
My boyfriend IS friends with this girl, however the dates Josh gave me are days we actually hung out (I have texts and photos to look back on. I’m sure I was with my boyfriend). I still did confront my boyfriend about this to cover my bases and we decided to go NC with Josh. 

A few weeks later Josh texted me asking if I was doing alright considering what had happened. I told him I was fine. He asked if we were still together and I said yes. He FLIPPED out at me. He became extremely angry and blocked both of us on all social media. 

A similar situation happened in the past with another friends girlfriend. He tried to get them to break up on a couple of occasions and admitted he had a crush on her. They, however, have remained friends (somehow lol). 

I’m okay with not being friends with Josh but I’m having a hard time understanding this situation. Why do people do this? Do people actually think that getting with an ex’s friends(or a friend’s ex depending on the perspective) is okay?? 

I do trust my boyfriend and we have been working through this. He never did anything wrong but this situation created just a smidge of doubt in my mind that I really fucking hate and want to get rid of. Even though all of his friends vouched for him and I do believe him, I still feel betrayed. It’s probably more related to what Josh did but im still trying to work on this. Part of me feels like if I can just understand why someone would do this, maybe it will sit better and I can move on? Unfortunately I don’t think he would talk to me and I really do not want to reach out to him. Any advice or experience with this would be wonderful. 

Tl;dr - my boyfriends friend claimed he was cheating on me, but all of his evidence was bullshit and he angrily blocked both of us when I didn’t leave my boyfriend. This situation created some doubt that I’m trying to move past but I don’t understand why someone would do this?",z255as,9,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z255as/my27f_boyfriends_friend30sm_tried_to_sabotage_our/,relationships
174,I [17F] hurt my [19M] ex boyfriend when ending the relationship and it still seems to affect him.,"I [17F] hurt my [19M] ex boyfriend when ending the relationship and it still seems to affect him.

We broke up about three months ago or so, not entirely sure.
I want to make extremely sure yall know im not trying to say that my ex shouldnt feel this way nor do i think of him any different than before because of this. What he is going through is completely valid and i can see why he is upset.

There have been multiple situations where i have come across him on the street and he has completely turned to go to the other direction just to avoid me. I find this incredibly immature, yet i can see why he does this. 
When we broke up i was meant to stay over at his place. His parents were in his home country, Poland, and he was left alone with the family dog. 
I had talked with my mother the previous night about how i should bring up the fact that i felt like he was growing more distant as the days went by. I practiced this speech in my mind and even out loud to myself before i headed to his house. (I had been at his place once before this)

Once there, i put my bag down and we watched a movie and played cards. We cuddled and everything was alright.
Once he started to think of snacks for us to eat at night i decided that this was perfect time to discuss my issue with him.
I asked him to sit down with me because i had an issue i wanted to discuss, he seemed interested yet slighty shocked.

I tried my absolute best to explain my issue to him, but i couldnt push myself to it. He grew impatient and told me to just spit it out as he slammed the table. I started crying because i felt so stressed about it.
He didnt react to my crying in any way and just stared at me blankly. I ended up getting an actual full on panic attack and forgetting how to breathe.

He got super irritated and i just soat out the first thing on mind which was that we should separate. He only nodded, got my backpack and told me to leave. He specifically told me, that i should go home and THINK about this further. Insinuating hed reach out soon.

Well, he never did, and i trued and tried to reach him. I called him and apologised, i texted him and apologised and then after a few weeks asked him if we could talk. I wanted to at least return his hoodie..

How do i get rid of this feeling in my chest?

The straw that broke the camel's back was this one evening when I was feeling really low, overwhelmed with all the problems life has thrown at me and despite me not wanting to burden him, he convinced me to talk about it. But then then during the conversation he was completely unengaged, uninterested, just mechanically performed his boyfriendy duty of ""being there for me"". Then he cut me abruptly, almost mid-sentence (while I was talking about my medical issuss) , cause it was his bedtime. It was something past 9 pm. He had to go to work nest morning

Over the few years we have been together , he never fended for me in any sense. He created the atmosphere in which I am almost scared to ask for anything. Absolutely can't lean on him. The very very few times we even made plans that involved him helping me with something, he messed up and  let me down and I was left much worse off than if I hadn't leaned on his help in the first place.
I want to feel like I have a partner in life, like I am not alone and like I am someone's woman.
I tried talking to him and it turned into an ugpy argument.

177,Should I (F18) date the guy (M20) who many people feel uncomfortable around?," 

I really need some help with this situationship.

I hooked up with this guy for a week until he said he caught feelings for me. (we've been hanging out for quite some time before we started to hook up). I told him that I would make a decision whether to break this off entirely or go into a relationship with him around May next year.

I've been really enjoying his company and I feel really comfortable around him. I enjoy sexual activities and also deep conversations with him. And I do think I have feelings for this guy, but probably not as much as his feelings towards me.

However, I've heard many stories about him. A lot of people say they don't feel comfortable being around him and the reason might be his personality is ""extra"". He is loud and can overreact, also his way of talking seems a bit too much to handle. And he might be seen as ""can't be taken seriously"". He also have touchy actions like touch people's arm when he reacts to stories. And many females find it disturbing. My friend even says to me that ""No one in this school likes him.""

Still, I think he is a really nice guy. He pays great attention to details, helps out a lot of people, including me, and he always treat me well. Even back when we were just friends, he went out to grab dinner for me although it was past midnight. And I'm sure he is always caring and goes out of his way to help out his friends.

So idk if he is being misjudged or he actually has redflags that I cannot see. Are the people in this environment too judgmental or am I the weird one?

I know I have feelings for him but I'm not sure whether I can go into a relationship if I'm scared of his reputation affecting mine ( a newly college freshman). Should I break this off now or should I not care about his reputation?

Please help.

TL;DR: A lot of people find him uncomfortable to be around with, but I enjoy his company and feel comfortable around him. We're currently hooking up but we both have feelings.

178,why did my bf want to break up but remain friends with me?,"i (23f) just broke up mutually with my 24m boyfriend. this kind of defeats the purpose of the title but i am not sure what happened. my bf said he has stopped feeling strongly for me since his grandma died and felt forced to be a good bf (eg. calling me regularly and doing more in an ldr). he also said we were just incompatible bc i was too quiet on our most recent date. 

i was quiet because i was still upset at him for lying to me about being at another girl’s house party at 4 am. (a girl he previously almost cheated with and i asked him for no contact). so i intended to breakup with him for that reason (i can’t trust or rely on him anymore) but he said we are incompatible because while he loves me, he doesn’t think he’s in love with me. and that he never felt a strong attraction to me from the beginning. (1 year ago) 

idk why he brought up so much stuff throughout the entire relationship, since he assured me previously his doubts were cleared about his feelings for me. 

then he said a month prior (when his grandma died and he fell into a deeper depression) that he started feeling less for me. i was supportive but definitely also an added stressor during that time as i felt neglected a few days later. 

i can’t help but think the depression may have triggered his sudden change in feelings and brought up doubts in us again. he also started partying and going out, something he never did before, to lots of girls’ parties around the same time and hasn’t stopped. it feels like he’s comparing me to someone else again when he brings up how incompatible we are because of how i don’t match his energy levels anymore. 

and i have reason to think he’s pursuing another girl or planning to after breaking up, as he said i’m holding him back (even though i never complain or stop him from trying to see new friends or parties, that don’t have a girl he’s cheated on me with) 

he also says he loves me and i’m his best friend and he wants me in his life for a long time or something. and a marriage pact. honestly i was too confused to be upset and i continued breaking up with him anyway. 

tldr our relationship sounded really toxic in hindsight but should i have provided more support to my bf after his grandma died or was the breakup inevitable and he was going to lose feelings anyways?

179,I think my taken boss (31M) is flirting with me (21F),"I am posting this for a friend with her permission: My friend met a guy at a party about 5 months ago, he was cute so she approached him to flirt. It turned out he was in a long term relationship so she laid off of the flirting.. Fast forward she is now working for him and they are very close buddies. They go out to bars about 1-2 times a week after work, and they text often (usually just memes, music or he has also replied to her stories on instagram). He mentioned to her that his partner was jealous when they talked at the party..  He has made comments on her appearance such as ""You're so adorable"" or ""you're cute""... The last time they went out to a bar, they had a very deep personal conversation about family and other things.. He even held her hands to feel how cold they were after she made a comment about having cold hands.

She wants to know if this is flirtatious, if she is overthinking this, or if maybe he views her as more of a little sister. We both have different opinions on this, and she helped me write this... But we are both curious of outsiders opinions, thank you!

180,I (36/f) have a longtime friend who always expects me to fold into her plans when she travels here.,"I have a longtime friend who moved pretty far away about 5ish years ago. She moved when she got married. At the same time, I got into a relationship and moved a few hours away. I’m now back in our original hometown and married with one child. 

Before we both first moved, we were great friends for years. I had been single and she was with her fiancé who had a lot of “hobbies”, so she was used to me spending a lot of my free time with her. We also had our separate friends. Whenever I would hang out with her friends, I never felt like I fit in. I was introverted and they were very extroverted and didn’t seem to like me. I would drink to fit in more, but anytime I wouldn’t drink and therefore would be more quiet around them, she’d tell me I was being “weird.” It really sucked. It’s like I wasn’t good enough for her compared to her outgoing friends. I will add that these are people her fiancé wanted her to be friends with. He often told her she needed to be more outgoing and to have that set of friends because they were all his friends’ girlfriends/wives. She rarely if ever hung out with my other group of friends. 

She had a lot of great qualities as well, and in many ways she felt like a sister. We would often spend our entire days off together shopping, getting lunch, and watching movies at her house until her fiancé came home. I will say that she was the one who would normally come up with plans or picked the things we did, but we were very alike so it always sounded fun. 

The trouble was after we both moved. I feel like anytime she comes into the state she expects me to road trip to her and fold into her plans (which is usually involving her friends that I don’t care for). Whenever I don’t do exactly what she wants, she gets pissy and then I’m left thinking I’m not a good friend. I have a husband and a daughter now, and I’m not the single person she used to know that could do whatever she wanted me to do whenever she wants. Here are some examples from over the years:

- Once she told me she was coming to our hometown for a wedding and asked me if I wanted to come and be her plus one to see her so I agreed. My fiancé at the time came with me, we stayed with my mom. I worked a ton and could only see my fiancé on the weekend so I wanted him to come to my hometown with me. My friend asked me to come get ready with the wedding party last minute and asked me to do her makeup. A) I’m very introverted so the idea of this made me nervous. B) I brought my fiancé with me so I never intended on being gone all day and all night. C) I knew the girl getting married and she didn’t invite me to her wedding so I felt a little odd joining the wedding party. She had also asked if me and my fiancé would stay with her at her airbnb that night so we agreed. Ended up she was very cold and angry towards me at the reception to the point I felt awkward and left after an hour and a half.  We went to the airbnb. She didn’t get in until the am so we had already fell asleep. The next day she left extremely early and asked us to do the airbnb chores for her. That day she also asked me to meet up with her and her (5 other) friends but I declined, I was pretty pissed at how she had acted. We still remained friends after this, we never talked about it but we got over it and continued to be long distance friends. 

-I got married and she couldn’t fly in to attend. I was understanding but I was also sad. She had just had a baby so it would have been a lot on her. I was never angry but this is the only time I ever asked her to go out of her way for me. 

-Fast forward about 2.5 years- I’ve had a baby and then Covid is somewhat calming down. She is flying in to see her family a few hours away and tells me about it. I’m not one to drive 4 hours one way and back the same day so I book myself an Airbnb. I tell her this but I thoroughly explain that I have no expectation on the length she could see me, I figured we would just meet for dinner and she would have to go back to her family. I was just going to enjoy my short mom vacation. However she tells me that she wants to spend the night at my Airbnb, she’s had enough of her family. Then she changed her mind and asks if I can just come visit her at her families house. I really didn’t want to do this, her parents are very heavy drinkers and it would be TMI to share but there was a lot of family drama going on for them. Her mom can act straight up nuts. Anyways, she finally says she’s coming to meet me at the airbnb after all (only 10 minutes from her family) but asked me if I can drive her two extra hours out of the way to the airport the next day. That would be 2 hours to the airport for me, then 6 hours back to my home. Her mom was being an ass and refusing to take her to the airport for going to spend time with me. I told her my husband had to work and I had to drive back early the next day. I didn’t even have the additional gas money to spend on this at the time. Anyways, she said that was fine. She comes to the airbnb and I realize our relationship is not what it used to be at all. She just seemed ready to get back to her husband and daughter across the country, and she didn’t have much conversation. 

-A few months later she tells me that she will be back nearby (about an hour or two away) for her sisters wedding and asked me to come. Her sisters wedding day was the day we closed on our house and moved in. It’s just me, my husband, and our three year old. We literally had to move everything out of our old house and into the new one the same day, there was no way I could go to a wedding. 

At this point we’ve grown extremely distant. We rarely talk. I’ve all but let the friendship go and so has she. We click like on each others posts, that’s about it. She told me about two months ago she might be in town in December, I told her to let me know. So far I haven’t heard, but what should I do if she does come? Just fold into her plans? Or just let the friendship go? Am I seeing things wrong? Is there a better way to handle this?

In my car, I can’t show him music because of this. At my house, I can’t show him YouTube videos because of this.

I have talked to him about this more than once and he is always so sweet and apologetic and blames it on smoking weed. 
He is a very good person and a lot of fun to be around and he’s helped me through a lot. 

But yesterday was the fourth time my gf (23) and I made plans with him and we drove 30 minutes to pick him up to go out. I called fifteen minutes before I got there so he knew I was coming. I waited outside of his house for 20 minutes and even knocked trying to get his attention but he never came out. 
He has sent me three texts since then apologizing saying “please forgive me” and “I love you I’m so sorry” and even tweeted “the things I miss in life because of a nap.” 

What frustrates me is I’ve told him if he feels sleepy at all or has been smoking a lot to not even bother making plans because I live far out of town and he can’t drive because of his tumor so it’s a big hassle to get there and him not come out. 
How should I proceed without being mean? I want to fix this problem but don’t know how.

Throwaway for obvious reasons. Also sorry for the jumbled mess I’m a wreck right now. 

Some backstory: my mother is a narcissist and has my dads balls in her purse. It’s been like that for years. 

I’m a full time college student and work part time. I don’t party or go out. I go to work, come home and do schoolwork and play video games. 

Before Halloween I got a little snappy with my mom. I later explained the situation and apologized but that was not good enough for my mother. She made it very clear she didn’t want to talk to me and was inviting my older sister to do things while excluding me. 

I respected everything she wanted I didn’t talk to her and went about my life as normal. Well this morning she texted me about wanting to mend our relationship. I didn’t reply because frankly at this point I don’t care to have a relationship with her. 

Well tonight she came into my room told me I had until after Christmas to move out. Alright okay I can make that happen. Then an hour later she texts me drunk off her ass with a handwritten “eviction notice” lol. Talking about how she’s done with my manipulation. I proceeded to ask her what she meant which she could not give me a definite answer to. 

I’m just heartbroken right now. The woman who gave me life is throwing away her and my father’s involvement in my life over a stupid text. I always pictured my dad walking me down the aisle and being involved with my future children, all of the holidays and birthdays. I’m absolutely devastated that that means so little to the both of them. A split second of gratification for her was more important than all of this. 

Today I mourn the loss of my parents.

They have a common ""best friend"" and they used to hang out all 3 of them quite a bit.(still do probably) 
They even went on vacation together last year and this summer they were planning to go on holiday to a different country.

Long story short this made me feel weird and I made my feelings clear to her. On the one hand I didn't like the idea of them being together and on other hand how could she hung out with her and not feel weird also?

Her way of thinking was ""Well first of all we don't even talk about you, secondly she doesn't care about you, she moved on etc etc"". Which it doesn't make much sense to me but anyway, why should they do these things either way? 

What I expected from her is to at least understand how I feel and respect it. In that case I would still feel weird but at least I would know that she considers me.. Instead I felt I was blamed for feeling that way. That's why I am now asking if this is normal.

p.s This happened last spring and it led to a big argument that caused our separation for the 1st time. We got back together some weeks later and now we broke up again for the last time.
This wasn't the reason we broke up, just the cause.

Separation is on the table.

This post is not asking for advice on fixing him or our relationship, but rather on how I can make the transition to solo gaming again. This is a big deal for me. It was my hobby before we met, but after all this time, I associate the booting of my pc with being together. Whichever game I load (those we never played together, of course), I don't get far before I tear up and have to shut things down again, depressed. 

The thrill I had in solo gaming once upon a time is nowhere to be found in the pain of loss now. I know it's there somewhere, but I'm doing a very poor job of rediscovering my independence. Please, how can I go back to enjoying gaming alone?

Advice? Reassurance? Thank you.

WARNING: May be hard to follow, sorry! So as above, my mom has a clinic and she has one employee.  I find her (employee) insanely attractive . She is also my rehab doctor(in said clinic) by circumstance for the time being (free option for me to take advantage of). I can tell she(employee) does try to keep it professional and likes to call me ""my friend"" around my mom. However we do get into very deep conversations from time to time and I feel we connect on a decent level. A remark to be made is she does have a boyfriend who is in the exact same field as doctor that works at another nearby clinic. I do not know all too much about their status or how strong the relationship is. Now, I do not want to ruin any relationships here but at the same time I can help but crush on her. I also understand how things can get sticky with being my moms employee. I also think she might have friendzoned/patient zoned me by now. I have worked my way out of the friend zone before, so thats no issue but is it worth it do so, if thats the case or if its not? I would love to ask her to lunch (I would of course ask for parents consent first in this matter) Also as far as my parents are concerned my mom does not really seem to enjoy the idea of me fraternizing with her, as my dad has made jokes about me getting with said employee and her having lackluster response.

&#x200B;

TLDR: I want to ask out my moms employee (her only employee, that also has a bf). Should I do so, if yes, how? Also, am I total dirt bag since she already has a bf?

187,I love this girl i’ve only known for 2 weeks…,"Me (17M) and this girl (16) met on an app called Yubo (basically tinder for minors)... I've been talking to her for just under 2 weeks and i'm feeling things i've never felt before even in past relationships that have lasted months. She lives about an hour away and we've gotten to hangout for the past 3 days. I feel like I couldn't live without her, or go without her. When we're in bed and she goes to sleep I get genuinely sad and I feel lonely, i've fallen for her so quick. I'm not sure how I feel about this, i've always knew that if and when past relationships end, that I would be ok in a few weeks and get over it, now i'm not even dating this girl yet and it feels like i can't live without her...


Do I genuinely love this girl? Am I only feeling this way because of the sex? I'm hoping for a response and I am genuinely scared for myself if things don't end up working out.


TLDR; Met this girl a couple weeks ago, She makes me feel like no other girl ever has, scared to lose her already.",z2gnzy,0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z2gnzy/i_love_this_girl_ive_only_known_for_2_weeks/,relationships
188,My (58 m) partner (58 f) has become completely celibate due to a medical condition and associated depression ... I love the hell out of this woman. What should I do?,"My wife has always had dark thoughts but this has become worse over the last 4 or 5 years, especially since COVID.  This dropped her libido to the point where we would have sex once every month or two, with varying degrees of satisfaction for either of us.  Almost two years ago, she developed medical issues which made sex more uncomfortable for her ... and she told me that she was celibate until this could be dealt with.  There is no guarantee this will ever be dealt with, and even before this she was hesitant about sex ... I think it will be another year or two before anything changes (if at all) and honestly by then any hope of a sexual relationship will have sailed.

Please understand that I love this woman ... she is my best friend, we have a lifetime of experiences together.  I truly believe that leaving her would hurt us both deeply, and in her case might trigger truly devastating consequences of her depression.

She is absolutely not the sort to consider any sort of polyamorous or open relationship.  Again, approaching her for this would, I truly believe, hurt her badly.

We've talked around this.  She sees herself as a failure as a wife.  No amount of reassurance works.  No expression of love seems to float her back to the top.  And nothing changes.  I have stopped trying because it just makes her more sad.  And I hate that.  

She is very resistant to seeking psych help, based on the experiences of others in her family with similar affective issues.

So what can I do?

I can suck it up and switch off my sexuality for good, right?  Except that I am athletic guy in my late 50's, women like me and seek me out, and I have TRIED THAT for the last 2 years and it is honestly driving me completely nuts ...  I don't want to be an asshole about this, but I truly love sex, and the intimacy and humour and care and compassion and sweat and giggles that go with it.  I want to care for someone like that again ... I want this badly enough that it is eating into my sleep.  I am afraid that I am beginning to drink too much.

&#x200B;

OR ... I can approach my wife about all this, stick the knife deep into her just when she is at her lowest.  Leave her, and risk the depression getting the best of her.  Tell her I am declaring our marriage open, and watch her leave me, with similar results.  At the very best, leave her at home after she ""gives me permission"" ... but in such a way that she would see herself as a true failure beyond any hope of redemption.

&#x200B;

OR ... I can be a right fucking bastard and cheat.  With the attendant risks of getting caught out, and then all of the above consequences occurring anyway.  Do I have the right to take that sort of risk with her health?

&#x200B;

This is my best friend, the mother of my child, I would do anything for her.  Why can't I be man enough to do this?

What should I do?  Are there other options I can't see?  

&#x200B;

I could use some help, Reddit.

189,am i (17f) making the wrong decision with my dad (48m)?,"hi everyone, im 17f and my brother is 15m and recently made the decision to go NC with my dad (my parents have been divorced for 5 years and up until october 1st shared 50/50 custody) there is way too much to unpack, but essentially my dad had an affair with my moms best friend, and things broke down from there. it was a messy 3 years before they divorced and i have anxiety attacks when they are together around me. 

anyway. my dad stayed with his affair partner, i’ll call her A. i don’t remember how i felt with her when she was first back in our lives. (for more info, my mom is in a relationship with A’s ex husband) i don’t really like A. i don’t think she’s respectable because of what she did to my mom, she’s also an attention seeker, money waster, superficial, gold digger etc. i think she and my dad deserve each other though. she also causes drama in my family a lot as she always tries to mess with my mom and has also been arrested in connection with a high profile case where i live, so that caused a disturbance 

anyway, A emboldened the worst sides of my dad. he started to get drunk and come into my brother and i’s room, sometimes to stare angrily or to berate us. he also attempted to get me hospitalised and went through a phase where he kept telling me what he was sexually attracted to and got angry when i told him to stop telling me that. we told mom about the drunk think and the hospital thing and not the sexual thing but she kept sending us back. 

anyway, i had a fight with A where i apparently yelled at her (i did not lol) and i decided to stay at my moms house because A was pregnant and i knew it would get worse and i don’t respect her and don’t like her or the person my dad is now. i was okay with seeing my dad weekly still as long as nothing rocked the boat. we told him how we felt about A face to face and he just denied it: “A is a good person, she doesn’t mean any of the stuff she does” “but you guys LIKE A” that’s when i decided i didn’t really care for this man, because he’s nothing. 

anyway, my mom got him to pay child support since both my brother and i are at her house 100% of the time, and A lost her fucking mind (she doesn’t work and is doing a degree at university she will NEVER get a job in because of her criminal record) and has asked my moms bf for child support even though their custody has a 50/50 split. it caused a lot of drama and she took my dads phone to write a mean text to my mom, which is when i decided i have no time, patience or care for my dad anymore and my mom allowed me to stop talking to him. 

but, my mom has been regretting it i guess? and tried to go behind my and my brothers backs to get him to come see us and he texted us something like “hey your mom said you guys want to see me” so i knew. i got in a fight with my mom and she eventually apologised and relented. i think that she thinks that if i don’t talk to my dad i’ll start sleeping around or something lol. i told her i don’t see him as anything but someone who causes upheaval in my life and he doesn’t love us if he can’t even do much as compromise for us. she relented and said fine, which i’m happy about but it’s been and endless argument of “he’s your father!!!” but i want to know when someone will tell him i’m his daughter.  

damn. writing this made me realise how much i hate him. i may block his number and be done with him.

tl;dr: i cut my dad off completely after years of upheaval, am i doing the right thing?",z26dx6,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z26dx6/am_i_17f_making_the_wrong_decision_with_my_dad_48m/,relationships
190,Trusting in relationship,"I(22f) just broke up with my ex gf(23f) a month ago. During these time I have been thinking about things that happened in the past. 

When we just started in a relationship, my ex would say something like “I feel like you didn’t trust me” and I’d be so confused because idk what kind of trust she wants, I never hide my feelings or thoughts from her. I say what I feel in my heart. Then after a month of dating we got into a big fight. During that fight I remember something that happened in my past and consequently affected myself now. I told her that specific thing in the past, which I never did to anyone but her. At that time she was pleased and say “this is the trust I want”. 

But it still didn’t stop. During our whole relationship. she still mentioned multiple times that I don’t trust her. Even after we broke up. She send condolences to me. And say that “I can see that you are struggling, I am trying to help you, don’t act like you know everything. Do not being stubborn and avoidance.” 
I told her that I’m actually doing very well, that I do not suffer from any form of mental problems. (Which I never have, I only got sad after breaking up for like two weeks then I’ve gotten better day by day)And thanked her or being there for me. I will reach out to her if I don’t feel good. Which she reply in anger. And said that she was sick of things never goes in her way, and saying that she doesn’t want to only exist when I needed her to be.

Does anyone have any thoughts or advice in this kind of situation? I am kind of lost here since I felt like I’ve done nothing right. 

Tl;dr 
My ex has been thinking that I don’t trust her during the whole relationship. I am very confused of what kind and how much trust she was referring to.",z2bsp5,2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z2bsp5/trusting_in_relationship/,relationships
191,Should I (30 f) let him (30 m) travel to visit me to give it one last chance?,"About half a year ago he visited my city, we matched on an app and thought we were in for some casual fun. However from the first night, it was anything but casual, it got super intense emotionally. However quite soon things sort of fell apart, retrospectively he said he became afraid since he lived in another state and he sort of was distancing himself and we were only in person for a few weeks. Once he went back we tried doing long distance but he was honestly quite checked out and it was unbearable for me so I broke up.

Months later it was obvious we still kept thinking about each other, we deeply and truly love each other. We started talking again but it was awful, we had different communication styles on text. It was not from the lack of care, it was just communication incompatibility, we would have long 5-hour calls sometimes. We had different expectations of long distance, and since we had such a shaky foundation in person, I found it super hard to maintain the long distance. I felt it was hard to judge someone and build trust with someone online. I broke up again because it was making us miserable and I was anxious as hell. I was so anxious I was hardly functioning in other areas of life, my work suffered, and I stopped going out.

A few nights ago, I just really missed him and we spoke and this time we have the opportunity to meet in person. For him to fly over and meet me for a few weeks, and then the following month he is actually able to move to my city. I feel torn on if I should let him visit me. On one hand, we've had a shit track record, and I'm super anxious about getting hurt again and we've broken up a few times, maybe I should just let it go, it feels a bit like reopening a wound that was in the process of healing.

On the other hand, perhaps it will be different in person, and maybe it's worth one last shot so we can move forwards, either together or not but it would give us some certainty. He thinks we never had a real chance in person. He is serious enough to want to move city to be with me. The love we have for each other is very real, that much I know. But honestly, I'm just scared of doing the wrong foolish thing and being hurt all over again. But I also don't want to have any regrets.

193,How common is it for breakups to happen out of the blue? (24m) (22f),"I'm just unsure if I'm overthinking this. I have abandonment issues.

Me and my girlfriend haven't broken up, and when we're together things are great. It's bubbly, cute, comforting and lovely.

However, most days of the week we aren't together, and she's a dry person on the phone. In texts, in calls, there's rarely a spark or a sign of affection from her. This has been the case to a degree from the start, but she used to send more cute messages or say a flirty thing or two on the phone.

The fact that most of our time during the week interacting is spent apart makes me anxious and fill in the gaps until we're together again. And her general dry and reserved mannerisms make me wonder if she's losing interest.

If there was a problem with us, would I typically know and have communication about it first? Or is it not uncommon for partners to just keep it to themselves and break things off there and then? Again, this type of anxiety must come from my abandonment issues, and I do just worry about asking up to a text that one day cuts things off, even though she's said some beautiful things about me in the past. Maybe she's just being comfortable in our relationship, I do not know though.

194,A girl I (19M) used to be close with gave me the finger today for no apparent reason. Should I ask why or leave it be?,"So I’m in college and when I was in my first semester had a girl in my classes that I liked and worked on a lot of projects with. We connected so much and just felt like we knew each other for years. We both had long distance partners at the time so nothing progressed beyond that. Then a month ago when college started again (now me being single) we saw each other and I immediately asked her I’d love to catch up and asked when she was free. She then stated she was really busy and declined. 

Regardless, we would see each other occasionally during the week because of our different classes and briefly say hi to one another. Today I saw her sit down at one of the couches across from me but didn’t make any eye contact towards me. I was with friends so I continued talking to them and then when it was time to leave I got up and she called my name to say bye and proceeded to give me a middle finger with a smile on her face. Confused I gave it back to her also with a smile. 

I now feel a sense of guilt for some reason. Should I ask her why or would that make it awkward?

195,Close friend (27F) shared her feelings for me (28F); I don't reciprocate,"My (28F) close friend and roommate of 3 years (27F) invited me to get dinner while she's house sitting for the next few days, which wasn't that out of the ordinary, but after going our separate ways, she told me via text that she has ""feelings bordering on romantic"" for me. She's an incredibly insightful, vulnerable, and emotionally aware person (some of my favorite characteristics about her in our friendship), and her text was thoughtful and left no doubt in my mind that she isn't seeking to manipulate me, nor does she hope for anything specific.

It's ""not undying love"" in her words, just something that's been on her mind for awhile. She herself is bi, and it's not news to me, but she's in a place where she's generally trying to be more open about who she is, in various aspects of her life that I've observed.

She wants to maintain our friendship because she knows I don't have interest in women in that way, even mentioned respecting any boundaries I need to put up. It's all very adult and mature and ""I'm sharing this neutrally but just had to tell you because I think it's important to be vulnerable"".

All of that is fine and good for her, but my initial feelings are mixed up. I don't know what to do with her honesty. I don't know what to do with our friendship. I value it so much, she's definitely my closest friend. It makes me deeply sad to think of that changing. How can I decipher what my role in all this is? What is my responsibility to her and to myself?

196,How do I stop worrying about my bf," I’m having some trouble and am wondering if anyone has advice.
My (24f) boyfriend(24m) and I are currently long(ish?) distance. 4 hours. I’m moving closer to him in a few weeks. We’ve been together for over a year. 

Anyways, right now he’s with his friends doing what’s called “Beer camp”. Basically they all hang out for a few days and go deer hunting and drink beer. I love that he gets to do this because he’s very passionate about hunting. 

However, I have been so anxious because I know he has issues with alcohol and they all drink and drive. It makes me sick. I have tried to talk to him about how dangerous and stupid it is to drink and drive, and he plays it off. The reason I am so anxious is not only that but he has also barely kept in contact with me. Now, I’m not expecting to talk all day, but I asked him to just shoot me a quick text here and there maybe in the morning and once before bed to let me know he’s not dead in a ditch somewhere. Last night I didn’t hear from him at all. Tonight is looking like the same thing. He shot me a quick picture this morning of a deer but that’s it. 

I am so afraid of him getting into an accident because I know they drink all day and then go hunting, and then go to the bars all night. Him and I have gotten in countless issues because when he gets drunk with me, he gets very mean and man handles me. It’s gotten to the point where I do not want to be around him when he drinks (which is very very often). 

Has anybody dealt with this, do they have advice? How can I keep calm and quit obsessing over it this next couple days? I have been giving him space and not texting him unless he texts me because I want him to have fun. I don’t want to seem clingy, especially when he plays off his drinking. I’m also sick with covid right now too so I’m home from work all week, so I can’t distract myself much.

197,Almost all of my (33F) friends are older than me and apparently that’s bad?,"TLDR: all my friends are older than me, and now I’ve learned that’s a problem, but I don’t know how to change it. 

Someone very close to me recently pointed out that I was one of those kids who didn’t really get a childhood (thanks to a familial expectation that I would behave and care for myself as an “adult” while still in primary school), and was well ahead of my years even as a young teen, which has sent me down a long road of self discovery. She and I are 5 years different in age, but have shared a close friendship since we were both teens, so hearing her validate this experience I had was poignant. 

In reflecting on that conversation I’ve realized that perhaps this plays a role in why I struggle to form close relationships with people my age. Because I “started early” I’ve now had a lot of experiences (10+ year marriage, divorce, and 17 years working in a field directly related to my career) that don’t align well with most people I meet who are my age. I also grew up with older parents, and in a fairly insular community, so all my childhood media consumption was 10+ years out of date, meaning my pop culture references are all wrong for my age. In addition to the differing life experiences, I also find that I’ve advanced in my career fairly quickly, and my professional peers are typically several years older than me. 

All of this has led to me having a perceived “peer group” who are 7-15 years older than me, with several of my best friends at the top of that range. 

I’ve learned recently that interpersonal relationships with more than a year or two age difference are almost always unhealthy, with the older person exerting too much power and control in the relationship. The problem is that I’ve never really felt a “power imbalance” in these relationships, despite the age difference. If anything, I feel like I’m in that “position of power” in relationships with people my own age. 

I’m not a super outgoing person, so don’t have a huge friend group, and don’t really like the idea of giving up on relationships that I see as beneficial and meaningful. I also don’t want to stay in unhealthy situations that hinder my potential for personal growth. Is there some way to “reverse” the things that have led me to this point? Am I fooling myself thinking these friendships could be healthy? Am I better off dropping those friendships, even if that leaves me without many (or any) close friends?",z29akh,1,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z29akh/almost_all_of_my_33f_friends_are_older_than_me/,relationships
198,I [23F] believe I am falling in love with my work colleague [40'sM].,"I am very confused by my feelings right now, and could really use outside advice. 

&#x200B;

So basically, I am a new teacher in my first year teaching. At my school, newer teachers are usually paired with a longer-serving ""mentor"" teacher within their same field. 

My assigned mentor teacher was ""Brian."" I liked him from the very start in a friendly way. He is easily one of the smartest men I have met, and I loved his sense of humor and very gentlemanly fashion sense.

We spent a lot of time together for work, and I got to know him pretty well. He has a kindly, professerly look to him and I was surprised at all he has done in his life. He was in the Army for nine years, and saw combat in Iraq/Afghanistan. He became a civilian mechanic for a while and worked on the fleet for a major city for a while. Finally in his 30's he decided to return to school and become a teacher. 

The more I got to know him, the more I liked him, and I began feeling that I am in love. 

My heart skips when I get to talk to him.

I feel true sadness when I get to work and he is out for the day. 

I find myself sometimes fantasizing about a life where he is my husband and loves me dearly. 

&#x200B;

What I know of him is that he is currently a single (divorced) dad of two kids, and does not seem to be attached to anyone romantically. 

It is slowly becoming hard to talk to him every day without telling him how I feel. I want to ask him out. 

But he is also my mentor at my first job in my career. Aside from my romantic feelings, I deeply respect him as a person, and I would hate to lose that relationship.

&#x200B;

Should I tell him how I feel, and ask if he will give me a chance?

Is it necessary to bury this all deep down and suffer quietly?

&#x200B;

I am so confused and any advice is helpful.

199,BF (M30) Hiding My (F28) Stuff?,"We’ve been together 3 years & I stay over at his house a lot. I have my own place but there’s a lot of back and forth / kind of living out of car so I have the things I need with me. Anyways, just occurred to me a few days ago my favorite pair of black jeans are no where to be found. Last time I wore them was at his house. Then I think about it some more and a new favorite belt of mine and the jeans I wore with the belt are MIA too. So I look everywhere at my place and my car to be safe (although I never really change in the car, I figured better look anyway) and everywhere at his. Nothing. So now I’m perplexed and rather annoyed. He doesn’t do laundry really and if he did I figured they would’ve been down in basement in a pile on the floor. Went through all the piles, none there. 

A day passes, a black pair of my jeans appear on the vanity, not the ones I was looking for. I let him know those aren’t the ones I’m looking for, the ones I’m looking for I wore exactly 1 month ago to a work event and came back here, slept, then went to work and didn’t see them again. They also look different. Weird but whatever. 

So I bring it up again, and he gets very defensive. After a heated convo I go downstairs and he finds the belt in a clothing basket in a spare room. This makes me remember that a new shirt I got at the same time of that belt appeared in that room a few weeks ago too, which I actually found myself and couldn’t explain how it ended up there either, I never go in there. He said it probably got mixed up in the laundry. The jeans I wore with the belt weren’t in the bin with them. Or the black pair. FWIW if he does laundry he usually tells me 

I’m starting to question my own sanity here, I have ADHD and I do misplace things. But there’s nowhere else to look! He has a key to my place and I commented the only place I haven’t looked is in my dryer, hoping they magically appear like the belt…but I haven’t looked yet I’m almost afraid to because what if Theyre there now and weren’t before? I’m reminded of when we got into a fight about 2 years ago I walked into the kitchen and he was throwing away my Burberry scarf (overpriced scarf lol). If someone would do that even though drunk would it be a stretch to think he’s hiding or trashing my clothes? He doesn’t get that drunk anymore and I chalked it up to that at the time. I don’t get why he would… any advice or help much appreciated.

We both see our relationship as end game, and aren’t in a rush to move in but want to start exploring what that might look like. We discussed renting some place new together, but he wants us to live in his condo as he owns it, and I get that he’s proud of his home and wants to enjoy it. 

Essentially, if I were to move in and split the rent/mortgage and fees 50:50 I would be paying virtually the same but to now give up my space. 50/50 would save him about $1500 a month.  My partner has made it clear he doesn’t want me to help pay down his mortgage, but is unsure what to charge and “wants it to be fair”

I want to live with my partner, but financially I don’t feel it would be equitable, especially when he owns and it contributes to the mortgage. (Which eventually would be our mortgage long term, but I’m trying to thing realistically should worst case scenario happen)

My partner and I love to take vacations and go out together, but I struggle to keep up financially. He is always more than fair with treating me to nights out and for larger vacations allowing me to slowly pay him back for my portion. 

How have you handled this?

201,Am I being "iced out" or just too sensitive?,"I (F30) have a friend ""Kelly"" (F30) who I have known since high school. We were friends in school and even stayed friends thru college. We always had other friend groups and she was never my ""best friend"" but we were close enough. 

I moved away for several years, and when I moved back to my state we ended up being in the same town and reconnected. We got closer and she started calling me her best friend, even asked me to be the maid of honor in her wedding. Flash forward 5 years and now we are literally one neighborhood across from each other and have little kids the same age. We even share a pool membership to the same pool. Neither of us really knew our neighbors just a few years ago so we were both starting from scratch getting to know folks around us. 

There was a big Halloween party in my neighborhood a couple of years back. At this time she didn't know anyone and I was just starting to get connected so I thought I'd include her...plus have a familiar face with me because I'm shy. Flash forward and over the course of two years she has gotten to know all of my neighbors with kids our kids ages.  Her neighborhood doesn't have young families in it like mine. She's met them because of shared school classes or the pool we all go to. 

So, the ""icing""- I started noticing that she'd share pictures of her being at the pool with literally people I introduced her to, but she didn't invite me that day. No big deal, maybe they just went at the same time or what ever.  But eventually the pictures turned into ""her crew"" or ""my ladies"" or ""our group"" and within the past year or so they seem like they are all best friends and I'm still just cordial with folks....invited to kids birthday parties but nothing more.  I started feeling like she was planning these pool meet ups with literally people I had introduced her too, but never included me....her ""best friend"". I feel so petty, but then can't help but to feel like if she would have just included me to all these pool meet ups maybe I could have gotten to know everyone and be a part of the group. 

I found out at the end of summer that they did in fact have a group chat where they coordinated all summer long about when to meet and it never crossed Kelly's mind to see if maybe I might want to join or be included. I got included the last couple of weeks by my kids teacher who didn't know (potentially) I was being excluded intentionally. When I saw all the folks and how they had been talking I just couldn't help but to feel like if the tables were turned I would have totally added her. It just feels so intentional to me. 

Flash forward to 3 weeks ago. I'm at a birthday party thats in my neighborhood, of course Kelly is there because now she's friends with all the folks in my neighborhood that are my age with kids nearly. She's chatting up her new close friend and they are talking about some charity event. I ask a little about it because I'm standing right there so it just seems like the thing to do. I'm offered minimal information and the conversation is changed. Yesterday i see a picture of all these women in my neighborhood and Kelly cheesing at this charity event that is literally two miles from all of our houses. 

I just feel like if it were me I would have said ""hey we are doing this event you should come!"" Again it just felt intentuonal. 

I feel like I'm getting left out and I feel like I'm too old to give a shit...like screw this  ya know. But it just sux when there are not really many other friend options because kelly has literally taken them all.  

Am I being too sensitive? Thoughts?

202,How do I (22F) talk to my best friend (21F) about her always cancelling plans?,"My best friend (21F) and I (22F) have been friends for about a decade now. I left the country for a few years but now we're living not even 10 minutes away from each other.

I planned out a whole nice day for us to spend together. Last time we hung out was because she, quite spontaneously, invited me out to do an activity I had been trying to plan out with her. We used to spend every halloween together. This year, she declines. Sometimes she'll shoot down my plans because shes sick, but the same day she'll go out shopping and text me about it. We havent hung out since the start of the month.

The day before the planned day where we'd get to spend some quality time at a nice place and then have dinner together at hers with ingredients I got for us, she sends me a message declining. At midnight, actually, so technically day-of. In that message she acknowledges and apologises for being so flakey, saying it's not fair to me. She has a good reason, but when every time she declines she has a valid excuse, and it makes it feel... less valid? She then says that we could still do dinner in the evening.

The next day comes and she never contacts me, so I make plans with someone else.

I'm worried. She's always struggled with anxiety/depression/mood stuff, which I understand. She had a recent hospital trip for her mental health, which she was quite explicit in telling me about. Though Ive tried asserting boundaries about talking to me about things like that without warning, I can't blame her for the state she was in. She's also having a lot of issues with her boyfriend of a year, and I'm concerned he's taking up all her time and energy.

All this to ask how I should go about this. She's now trying to resume conversation as if nothing happened (cancelled plans, never following up), but I'm honestly quite upset/done with it all. I don't know how I should approach this situation. Wait for her to reach out and talk to me? Confront her over text? I just miss my best friend.

TD;LR: My best friend of 10 years never makes time to see me. Should I confront her over text, or wait for her to plan something and carry on?

203,"We agreed to leave eachother, but I think I've made a mistake.","I (25m) met this girl (25f) while working in another country. We met 4 months ago when we started working together, and ended up spending almost every day of those 4 months together. Initially we started only really fooling around, but I knew in the back of my head I was going to get attached to her, as she's just brilliant. 


 We also both knew I was going home in around 4 months, and so we moved forward in our relationship knowing eventually I'd be leaving. I hadn't seen my family for 9months, she was starting her degree and would be moving soon, I want to travel, learn to drive etc. She has her dedications. Things didn''t add up and so we agreed it be best for us to call my leaving a see you later. No long distance relationship, or strings. Just a goodbye and good luck. Which was really fucking tough. But we have left eachother on great terms. And still keep in touch.


I ended up spending a lot of time with her family who I got to know well. I knew her friends from around the idyllic little town we shared. We shared things with each other we'd never shared with anybody in the past, now I feel like she knows me better than most. 


I can't help but feel like I've made a massive mistake leaving her. It almost feels like she's exactly what I want, but can't have right now. And the thought of her meeting someone else is dreadful. But that really is her own prerogative. 
I don't even know what I want to hear from you guys. Maybe I've grown too attached in just 4 months. Or maybe she just is that great. Idk but any words are appreciated. Cheers

204,My mom gets mad whenever I bring household issues to her.,"I am a 23 F. Unfortunately I live outside the U.S. in a country with a serious housing crisis right now so moving out is not an option for me nor my peers. I live at home with my single mother F59 and my 2 brothers 27M and 21M in a small 3 bedroom home. We all contribute to the bills monthly. Since August 2021, my brothers and I have not spoken. There were 2 very minor, separate instances where they both blew up at me and called me b*tch/dumb b*tch. 

My brothers get away with a lot of stuff. They never clean up after themselves (hair on the sink, overflowing garbage, don’t flush toilet etc), never do chores, scream at the top of their lungs daily and curse loudly throughout the house and my mom I have since accepted this and try not to complain. 

Whenever I bring up simple issues to my mom she says that we need God and need to stop living in strife as siblings. 

My older brother recently brought a maintenance man over without letting anyone know. We have a family group chat so a quick text would have been good. Now, my younger brother has been having a girl over for a few nights. I only know this because I see a car in the yard. I just told my mom that it was a bit inappropriate to have a stranger in the house and he should just let people know by sending a message in the group chat. 

My mom went crazy and said that the “little boy” just had a girl over and it was none of my business and I should stay in my room. She said I was annoying her and stressing her out. She also said I was being bitter and full of hatred and said that we as siblings need to stop hating each other. She said that I treat her badly and I’m problematic. I felt so hurt and started crying because of how misunderstood I felt.  

I told her when I was in college my roommates and I would always communicate stuff like this. When my boyfriend first came over in 2020, I asked my mom permission and also let my everyone know. Since we are all adults living together and not really a family I would expect the same?

Am I in the wrong here?

Throwaway account. Should I (24f) break up with my boyfriend (26m) of almost 5 months? At the beginning it was great, we started dating pretty quick and spent most of our free time together from the very start. I really believed he was my person. But lately it’s just gone downhill. Before we became “official” he was very sweet and affectionate, but since than it’s like pulling teeth to get anything and it’s left me feeling like I was love bombed, I voice my feelings and I get treated like I’m dramatic, I catch him checking girls out while we’re out and stalking other girls social media profiles who look nothing like me. The relationship is full of double standards, I pulled away from him and told him I was thinking of breaking up with him to see if maybe that would make him realise something was wrong but instead I just got made to feel like a bad partner and told he doesn’t think I love him anymore so I caved and apologised, he’s allowed to treat me whatever way he wants but I do one thing remotely like he does and he shuts off. I feel like he’s very emotionally immature and doesn’t know how to communicate, everything turns into a fight and him shutting me out. I honestly don’t know if I need advice or a vent but my mind is pretty much made up that it’s probably over.

One thing we both agreed upon is that we don't have opposite sex friends in our relationship. It's one thing we liked about each other. As of 5 months ago she tragically lost her younger brother (19) 5 months ago to cancer and it has been very tough. I stayed with her family. Helped them as much as I can and have gave her space as well. It hasn't been easy and she has her moments where she does put her anger onto me, but she does usually apologize and I try to understand that it's not about me and that she's just grieving. During this time she met his best friend. She prior never met him due to her not living at home. He would be there for her brother when he was struggling, but he has been close to my girlfriend and she has been getting close with him. She tells me I don't have anything to worry about, that she looks at him as a younger brother and he looks at her as a older sister.
That they see her brother in each other. Especially because how much they talk. It does make me feel uncomfortable how close they are getting and how he vents to her about his own relationship problems to her and other things. My girlfriend does know I don't really like it, but when I voice it she gets mad at me because she says I dont understand and that this is different because what he did for her brother and who he was to him.

208,"My boyfriend told me that he hadn’t had sex with anyone while we were temporarily broken up. Later, I find out that he had had oral sex with three different women. He insists he was honest but I feel deceived."," Last year, I (F22) broke up with my boyfriend (M25) because my job was taking me to live somewhere pretty far away from him from him for at least six months and didn’t think I could handle long distance. However, because we both still loved each other and struggled to hold boundaries, we kept in touch very closely. We continued talking and a few months later, he came to visit me. By the time he visited, I regretted my decision to break up with him and expressed that to him and told him I wanted to get back together. He also wanted to get back together but under the condition that we be in an open relationship. His justification was that I had had sex with other people since we had broken up while he had not. I did not want to be in an open relationship with him and expressed that to him. He continued to push for an open relationship, always making the argument that it would not be fair to be closed since he had not had sex with anyone else and I had. Eventually, I relented and agreed to something that made me constantly anxious. 

At the end of the six months, I moved back to where we had been living together and he agreed to close the relationship then. Only then did I learned that over the course of the several months when he claims he had not had sex with anyone, he had actually had oral sex with three different women. One of the women he had hooked up with multiple times (around 4 times). He insists that he was honest with me but I feel very deceived and hurt. I am not mad at him for having had these encounters with other women but I feel like he used a loophole to get me to agree to something I did not want to agree to. He is not taking my hurt seriously and his belittling how upset I am.

This is not the first time I have felt deceived by him with regards to sex. After our relationship started I had asked him about the women he had had sex with when we were dating casually but not yet exclusive. A significant amount of time after that conversation I learned that he omitted two women. He insists that it was an accident and he had forgotten to mention them. 

I feel incredibly hurt and deceived but he continues to act like I am overreacting. Am I?

I 16M am in a long distance relationship with a girl 17F. We have been together for a year and a half and have met several times over the course of our relationship. (We live about two hours apart, but have found ways to meet without our parents finding out). I never told my parents, because I knew they wouldn’t approve, so I basically kept it a secret from them for the entire time.

They came across some texts between me and her a couple weeks ago which led to them finding out about her. They told me to cut contact because of age difference (she is 1.5 years older than me), the fact that she her parents would not approve of me at all because her family is muslim, and the fact that its long distance and they would rather me make connections where I live. I didn’t end up cutting contact though. Fast forward a couple weeks and while looking through my phone they found texts between us i forgot to delete and told me to do the same, this time sending her a text to not contact me and limiting my access to electronics and also taking away my ability to drive because they don’t trust me.

I really really like her and she means a lot to me. It’s not just an online thing either. The time we had in person is one of the best memories of my life. I’ve explained to them I like her and I like her in real life too but they don’t seem to care. I really really want to be with her and I don’t think my parents are being reasonable.

We have both been very committed and throughout the relationship have never had any problems until about a week ago when I brought up my concerns with her getting drunk and high with her coworkers after working 13-14 hr shift all friday-sunday. their ages range from the youngest (the one she had the one night with) 19 to the rest being 28+. After a weekend of me calling and texting her accusing her of being unfaithful she said that for the last two weekends of her job we should take a break from texting and calling and after i asked if it was to be with other men she assured me that it was mentally draining to have to deal with a toxic work environment and constantly being yelled at and with a my emotions (which i will admit i overreacted) and me calling and texting interrupting her sleep. She also assured that she only wanted to be with me and that doesn’t look at any of her coworkers like that because they are like big brothers to her. Having met all of them I can assure that it was like that way with all but one and it was the one married with a kid at 19. after working together for 7 weeks prior she had stayed true to that and stayed faithful but due to a very rough week between me and her she was upset with me and after a night of drinking and smoking between both people (the guy had done shrooms weed and alcohol) they were talking about how both their significant others had been upsetting them and after about an hr this lead to them being intimate with eachother. after i found she broke down saying that the second it started she felt horrible and that it wasn’t supposed to even happen she just wanted to be held and told that everything was going to be okay between us. After being told that i asked her why she didn’t just come to me and talked to me she said she wanted to but couldn’t drive because she wasn’t sober. She seemed very remorseful and non stop said she has never felt so terrible about something and wish it never happened and doesn’t understand why i want to say together. I dont want things to end off a mistake like that but i dont know if i can trust her the same anymore. She has since cut all communication from him and blocked him on everything and swore that she wont look in his direction again and promised to not smoke and drink after work and wouldn’t leave my friend that she works with place after work. I dont want things to end but i don’t know if i’m doing the right thing or not and im wondering if i should do something else. Any advice is helpful.

214,How do I hold space for my stepmom [49F] who hurt me [22F] When she herself was hurt?,"To preface: My stepmother has been married to my dad for close to 10 years, since I was 12. Currently my stepmom and I have a better relationship, but while I was growing up, she used to be very cruel. She hit me a few times out of frustration, and we would get into verbal arguments a lot. She is a religious woman and raised me by the quote “spare the rod, spoil the child.”  She has expressed that she doesn’t believe children have “rights” and that control and authority is the way to bring a child up. I don’t add this as an excuse, or even to make her the villain, but to add more context to her mothering. 

I held a lot of hate and resentment in my heart for her, but as I’ve grown up we’ve grown closer and even get along really well. 

Recently, I got the opportunity to hear her side of things. My father [55M] is very emotionally abusive towards her. He was very controlling, not allowing her to work an out of state job she really loved. He gets angry at her for asking simple questions. In one severe instance she spilled boiled hot oil on her hand, rendering it unusable for over two months. The day she got burned he refused to drive her to the hospital and told her she was being dramatic. Over her continuing healing process, I have been the one to help with everything- and while I do not mind caring for her, it makes me upset that my father hasn’t. 

There was so much more she went through- that does NOT excuse her actions towards me, but helped me garner sympathy. I also was aware that as a teenager, I could be very self-centered and aggressive and I apologized for my behavior. 

Now I am in a strange place, I want to hold space for her and the struggle she went through (and still does.) But I don’t want to completely ignore my own experience. There are times I still feel afraid of her as an adult. I want to be accountable for the ways I may have contributed to her emotional neglect as a child/teen, while also finding my own peace with her. It took a while to admit, but I do love and care for her and it makes feeling this way all the more complicated. I understand how complex and confusing this may be, but any guidance would be a great help.

215,"Feeling challenged in a relationship vs valuing stability, comfort, peace?","Hi there – sorry if this post is a bit hard to read. I’ve tried to not ramble too much and thought about formatting but I’m feeling a bit scrambled.

I’m [25F] fresh out of a relationship of 6 years with my partner [25M] which ended with his main reasoning of unhappiness in being like he was not challenged enough.

Our relationship day to day was really happy (this being mutually agreed, not just my feelings), however every year he would bring up feelings of not being satisfied. At first these were things that we were able to work on, but these feelings didn’t go away for him and we would have this conversation annually, which didn’t usually end up in a solution as we instead opted to keep the peace and go along as we had been.

I recognise this is unhealthy – and it has a lot to do with my personality of being immensely conflict adverse. We would get along really well and there never really felt like there was anything to fight over but if there was, it was quite difficult for both of us to bring it up – for me, because I hate confrontation, and him knowing how much it would shut me down, and break down. This was something I’d been improving on in recently years, in voicing my needs more and not completely shutting down when confronted.

Yesterday when we broke up it was after a lot of reflection by my partner who had made up his mind after we had spent 6 months in a LDR. He had a lot more time to mentally prepare, whereas although he’d told me how he was unhappy with things, I wasn’t really prepared for an actual breakup. 

When it came down to it, the main reason he had come to realise was that he didn’t feel challenged enough in the relationship – that he wanted to be pushed to be a better person, instead of being accepted all the time. This again, due to the fact that I find that I always overlook faults in the people closest to me and choose generally to only ever focus on the good.

I’ve come to realise we valued completely different things in a relationship. He values challenge and inspiration (and felt invigorated when we were apart) whereas I value comfort and stability. I’ve also realised one of the big reasons why I may have felt so desperate to hold onto this relationship could just have been to hold onto a notion of home and belonging I had found and built with a person.

My big question is – there is so much focus on how your partner should always be bringing the best out in you, and make you want to be a better person (and in my mind, equating to wanting challenge in a relationship). I recognise that of course, there needs to be some communication of needs and things don’t just fall into place with no conflict. But is it wrong to simply be satisfied with comfort and stability with another person? To be satisfied if you have enough in common with another, and to feel at peace with them? To me, the idea of just “being”, with another person is very important. That yes, I’m imperfect and far too sensitive, but feeling accepted and loved and free to be who I am completely. I keep thinking now that I’m never going to have a successful relationship again if I don’t change myself, but then again I can’t tell how much so can change and how much is just who I am as a person. 

TL;DR: is it okay to value peace and stability so much in a relationship over challenge? Is it unhealthy, and something I need to work on before trying again with love?

PS: What hurts most (a lot of things hurt at the moment!) is realising how much my partner did make me want to be a better person, and how I wasn’t able to give that back. I always reassured him he was fine as he was, that I loved him just as he was (which was true, and what I would’ve wanted) – but that wasn’t what he wanted to hear.",z25fdn,2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z25fdn/feeling_challenged_in_a_relationship_vs_valuing/,relationships
216,My(31M) LDR GF(25F) has blocked me on all platforms after a fight,"sorry, this turned into a ramble and probably has little coherence  


my gf and I have been in a relationship for a year and 3 months now. After I went to visit her in her country in Feb, she was kicked from her home by her aunt. I found her a place in her city so she wouldnt have to live with her abusive sister. I've paid the rent on this place 7 times out of 10. She had a job dishwashing for 7 months before she quit it so that she could have the time to come to my country, but the visa was not approved and she was left without any income. The visa was rejected in mid Oct.   


Since then she had been looking for work and trying to take a food-prep course so she could get more opportunities. This course was only eight 20 minute videos that she would have to watch. Pretty normal stuff. She hadnt finished after 3 weeks. She would refuse to answer any questions around how her progress was going, telling me not to push her. I was fine with that, but I was concerned. I wanted her to be independent of me financially, and she did as well.   


She was procrastinating and not doing the course. I knew she was troubled and having problems sleeping, her sleep schedule is very out of natural sync, partly so she can talk to me (5 hour timezone difference), though I've always tried to get her to sleep normally, and if we go without talking she can. However I find even then she won't be able to sleep. Regardless.  


I wasn't able to sleep myself this weekend and I kept coming back to her not taking action to finish the course and find a job. I was beginning to feel like she wasnt trying very hard at all about it. I get being distracted for a week maybe, but its a very short course. I contacted her at 2:30am my time, 7am her time. she hadnt slept at all, trying to pull another all nighter to reset her schedule.  


I tried to approach her gingerly about it because she had responded so defensively before, and I really was sympathetic to her, I thought. She told me that the way I tried to reframe my words as sympathy was wrong, and insincere, and that I actually pitied her, which I didnt think was the case. She tried to tell me that I couldnt even figure out my own emotions, matter-of-factly. She told me she was in fact procrastinating, and that she felt bad enough so that I shouldnt stir the pot.  


I felt like something had flipped in my heart when she told me i was being insincere. I asked how long she had left of the course. she said it wasnt my business. she would say when she was done. I replied that when i was paying her rent that her finding a job and being autonomous was part of my business. she repeated herself. i told her to hurry up. its not that long and it had been weeks since she started. she told me i had crossed a line. i gave a, rather insincere sorry, tbh, and i repeated myself. she blew up and in not so few words told me to fuck myself.  


she then refused to listen to me and blocked me on all platforms i could reach her, and deleted her accounts. her youtube playlists. she left our shared discord server. she wont respond to anything.   


its been 4 days and I'm not sure how to feel. i was immediately regretful that I had pushed her and been so callous, but i couldnt properly apologize, and try to explain myself. i felt also like i was free from these episodes of explosive anger. since that night, ive jsut been sad and lost and alone without her. I'm really hurt that she would cut me off so severely. she has a history of doing that with online ""friends"" and her narc family, but i guess I thought i was different.  


I know exactly how she sounds, and i know people would tell me to be glad if they knew the facts, but i know her when shes not angry and she's so sweet and makes me feel so happy. i still love her. i cant forget the time we did spend together. i guess the worst part is that she never said we were over, aside from her actions of completely ripping any tie to her. i still want to pay her rent for next month so she isnt made homeless again. i feel so empty without her.   


she was my first long term relationship. the first woman i really loved. i still love her. im sad that she would hurt me like this. i know i have blame in all this. i pushed and pushed when she made her boundary clear, and i was uncharacteristically bullish and callous about it.  


im just rambling now, i guess. thank you to anyone who read through it all. im not sure what im looking for by posting this. id welcome any comments.

I wouldn't really care if she didn't if she wasn't always complimenting other dudes, and it just makes me feel like i'm not attractive to her. what should i say? or am i just in the wrong

218,My (23F) partner (24NB) is too busy to talk or argue or be affectionate,"
I don’t know what I’m hoping to get out of this post, I just feel very lonely. My partner is a university student (as I am, we are both 24) and it’s been a heavy year for them. They’re constantly working on reports and submissions. They’re pulled back emotionally and I feel like I can’t even talk about what’s going on with me freely bc they won’t pay much attention to it. They have also been withdrawing affection, I feel like I’m the only one who says “I love you” or “I miss you”. And recently I’ve started two fights, without meaning to, that just ended with me being in the wrong and my partner saying “I don’t have time for this”. 
Now I don’t blame my partner nor am I mad that they’re too busy to see me or talk to me often. But I am struggling with the withdrawn affection and emotional distance. What should I do next and how do I better deal with this?


I also feel like it’s worth mentioning that we live in a country where we have limited access to each other. For example we both don’t live alone and we can’t do things like spend the night together or meet up late at night.

219,Are hallmark movies real?,"My husband (38M) and I (30F) have been together for 6 years. When we first got together I moved from one part of the country to his to be together. While there he was perfect.  
Some backstory about us he grew up in the “house of hard Knox” and i had a “leave it to beaver” life. He’s an unmedicated, alcoholic, bipolar with PTSD. I have high functioning autism, ADHD, and perfectionism tendencies.  
We moved back to my side of the country 6 months ago and has been having a hard time finding a job, getting money, and has lost his zest for life. I make enough to support us and I kept telling him telling him to get help for his depression.  
I went on a work trip and out with some work colleagues. (Nothing new I’ve done this before.) He was insecure about it and had been accusing me of cheating at least once a month since moving. I stupidly went home after my trip and he had set up a bed in our spare bedroom. When I approached him about it he said he didn’t want to be with a cheating c*nt. After I told him I wasn’t he flashed on me.  He grabbed me and threw me against the wall. I ran to our bedroom where he threw me on the floor. He got on top of me and I kicked him off of me and ran out of the house with my bags still packed from my trip and loaded my car.  I went to the hospital and was diagnosed w a concussion.  
The hospital called the cops and took photos of my injuries like csi. I did not press any charges. I haven’t been home since and he’s saying that because I’m “hyper independent” he felt insecure. He took an anger management class. He’s being apologetic but maintains that I drove him away.  
I still love the man because our 6years of marriage was a fairy tale. He never showed any signs until that day.  We dont have children but have been trying. 
Should I forgive him? 
I’m staying with a friend and my friend maintains that he could’ve killed me. She thinks I’m in danger and need to divorce him.

221,Should I break up with my fiance??,"Me (w/21) and my fiance (m/18) have been together for a year and engaged since August of this year (he is more mature than his age btw). We both still live with our parents. We had already planned our wedding and even booked a location and a catering for next year august but last month we had a big fight because he had a hard time accepting my non belief.

He is religious and goes to church every sunday. In the past I went with him because it was a reason that allowed me to sleep over at his house (in a guest room, not in one bed). Normally his parents don't allow me to sleep there because of religious reasons which already makes me furious since I feel like they force their beliefs onto him and we told them that we don't have sex before marriage and that's true. I feel like they don't trust his words.

I slowly wanted to stop going to church with him since I don't really like it. He didn't know if he could accept my non belief. He seems to have accepted it now. His parents played a big role in this as well. They are nice people. They were nice to me and treated me very well, I'm grateful really. The problem is just that they treat my fiance like a child. He doesn't have his own bank account for example even tho he earns his own money for a few years now. It bothers me a lot.

Another thing that bothers me is that we have a lot of differences. He is religious (fundamentalist). I'm not. He is introvert. I'm extrovert. He still makes me very happy. He is really the best boyfriend imaginable. Loyal, kind, funny, sweet. We have a lot of fun when we're together and laugh alot. It still feels like that when we see each other. Lately when I'm not with him I'm doubting this relationship.

I miss him terribly when we're not together. I hate going home. I have a bad relationship with my parents. It frustrates me that I can't sleep over or move out with him. He wants to move out after marriage but he doesn't want to marry me now. He wants to take time after our fight but I don't think that I can wait any more time. I knew that everything would be like this but I don't know if I can accept it like it is any longer. I don't want this pain anymore. Leaving him everyday and missing him. I just want to come home to him and sleep next to him. At the moment he is still learning his job but next year he will be working shift and he won't have as much time as now. I will miss him even more.

To conclude,

me and my fiance have different religious beliefs and it will be a challenge for us especially with kids. I also am scared that he tries to change my beliefs. He's sad that I don't believe in the bible. Also his beliefs are a higher priority and he wants to go to church on saturday afternoon (for the youth) instead of doing something with me for example going out with friends etc.

he doesn't want to marry me yet (I can understand it) but I'm unhappy with the situation as it is because I can't sleep over at his house and miss him terribly. It's something that can be changed. he could stand up to his parents since he himself even said that he chose to follow the rules. But he wouldn't do it for me. It's something different when we would live together. When he has to go to work then I can totally accept it but I can't accept that I have to hurt like that because of something that can be changed.

he made me the happiest I've ever been.

I don't know what to do. I knew all of those conditions from the start. I chose this relationship. But now I don't know if I can't handle this any longer. Should I break up?

222,My friend was toxic to her ex and i don’t know what to do,"Im 15F (trans mtf), my (irl) friend who i’ll call R is 15F, her ex-gf who i’ll call J is 16F (also trans mtf), R and J were dating over the internet (discord) for about a year.

A few weeks ago i found out that my friend was pretty abusive to J, i’m gonna list the stuff  i was told she did.
Very manipulative
Pressured J into doing things she was uncomfortable with 
J was constantly afraid R would kill herself or hurt herself 
R was very controlling 
R made J hurt herself for pleasure 
R threatened to hurt herself 
Gaslighting 
R would use J as a like suicide hotline 
R would not be very supportive to J
R was transphobic and trans fetishising 

after I heard all this stuff i decided to stop being friends with R, it was hard tho since we’ve been friends for around 10 years now and since i stopped talking to them i’ve been feeling more shit and more hopeless than usual which doesn’t help with my depression (not diagnosed yet). 

Earlier today R messaged me explaining some of the things she did. She said she admits that she did awful things and regrets it all but also said that some stuff was taken out of context etc.
R said that she wasn’t transphobic just made jokes about girls with dicks being hot (i’ve heard them make jokes like this before so i believe them and they’ve also never said anything transphobic before) she’s since stopped joking about stuff like that
She also explained that J never said anything about not being comfortable with stuff which explain the pressuring into things etc, she said that if she knew how J was actually feeling she’d break up with her,she also realised what she was doing was wrong and tried to leave J but J begged her not to and also R still loved J and didn’t want to entirely leave. 
R also said that she thought J was ok with the making J hurt herself thing and i know it’s still fucked up but yeah.
R also said that J did similar things to her just not quite as bad

TL;DR: a lot of the toxicity was miscommunication but also R did lots shitty things.

223,My[22m] roommate [22m] will make dinner for everyone but exclude whoever he's mad at [Non-Romantic],"Hello,

I live with 3 of my closest friends all male, aged 22. A reoccurring problem I have been noticing is a significant lack of conflict resolution skills. I need advice for how to deal with this situation.

My one friend who we'll call R, often finds himself in conflict with everyone else in the house. Whenever he's mad, he won't actually discuss the issue with them, but will spend a week talking to everyone else about the issue giving a one sided version of it, and then finally after building resentment will yell at the person. However he's started doing something over the past 3 months that I absolutely do not like.

R is a good cook. If he is mad at someone, he will spend a whole evening preparing a full meal for everyone, except the person he is mad at. When the person finds out or sees what is happening, they'll get upset. But everyone in the house except for me thinks this is okay. They say that ""it's R's food and time. He gets to decide who he wants to share food with and who he does not"". Well, after doing this 6 or 7 times it finally happened to me.

I let him know that I found it manipulative, and it was NOT a way to treat a friend. That I am always open to discuss issues, boundaries, and rules. Apparently he's been mad at me for several weeks because I did a bad job of cleaning a dish I made rice in. He accused me of trying to sabotage a date he was planning as he wanted to use that dish to cook a meal for a girl.

None of my friends had my back. They said the same thing about how it's his time and food. If he wanted me to clean it I would have happily done it and made sure to be more careful next time - mistakes happen and that's okay. Especially since this has never happened before. Everytime I try to establish a protocol for discussing issues, boundaries, and rules with R he always responds with ""Well what about x thing you did"". He says boundaries form naturally with social pressure and that rules and protocols are a waste of time. I try to say households be it marriages, friends, or roommates require lots of communication, upkeep, and follow ups but he completely stonewalls me.

What do you guys think? R told me he's mad at another roommate, and is making that roommate's favourite meal for everyone except him this Thursday. 

Thoughts?

224,ex-best friend is back,"Okay so, basically, this past December, my (f24) best friend A (m25) of 2 and a half years started seeing this girl B (f24?). We went from hanging out (him, another friend, and I) 3 times a week, to all of us being busy because of holidays, to seeing him like 3 times from January-June. 

For context, I helped him a lot with his mental health and was always there for him. He went to a hospital for a bit and me and his mom were the only people allowed to have the number. He was also my shoulder to lean on when needed.

During February, A+B became official. We all went on 2 double dates, and I went to a thing for his birthday over these months, those were the only times we saw him. During that time I was also told he and I could not hang out alone, that I needed to dial back our friendship (which I had to the point where we barely talked because I didn't want to make her upset). It became apparent that no matter how nice I was or how dialed back the friendship, she would never like me. During this time we also had several fights filled with him making me feel like shit til I apologized for something I shouldn't have to, and me crying, that always ended in him saying we would always be best friends and that I never needed to worry about losing him. At the end of things I ended up offering to just not be friends, just be acquaintances because my boyfriend is his friend so we would see each other at group things. He and I ended up having a three hour phone call where he made plans with me to come to my school with me so we could take classes together as we are in the same field. We talked about life and just it gave me the most hope for the friendship I thought was dead in the water. 

2 days later I had a 3 hour anxiety attack, and almost quit my job. I called, no answer, then texted that I would appreciate hanging out tonight. No answer until 10 that night saying ""sorry I was busy"" then a text at 4 am saying we could no longer be friends.

This effected our whole group, someone even hated the situation so much that they stepped away from the group and we haven't spoken to them since. No one heard anything from A until very recently, when a week or so ago he hopped in a lobby with one of our friends. Then this past Sunday he texts to apologize, tell me he regrets it and that he doesn't expect forgiveness, just that he wants to apologize and talk about it all in person so that we can at least be in a place where we are civil and able to hang out in a group. 

Now I never had feelings for him and vise versa. We were family. But it hurt a lot when all of this went down, and fucked me up for a few months, it also strained a lot of my friendships and my relationships. I basically withdrew from all of my friends and a lot of my insecurities got brought back up. Not to mention he shattered my trust. It basically consumed me for nearly the whole jan-june process and then like 2 months after

I'm still quite angry, but our mutual friend is telling me to just fix shit and work through it so we can all be friends again, and I don't want to fuck up the friend group permanently. 

Honestly I just don't know how to handle this or what to do.

225,I ruined my relationship over drugs,"Me (21M) and my now ex boyfriend (21M) dated for a year.


Everything was sweet, he was nice and made me feel loved and confident and I had genuine plans to marry this dude.


Halfway through the year we dated I started smoking weed, nothing too much just occasional stuff. He didn't care as he also smoked weed, he just wanted me to be safe and to be careful with who I smoke with. In the past months I've been experimenting other soft drugs, not long ago trying hard drugs (although I did not tell him), I'll admit I couldn't stop myself because they made me feel relaxed, unlike other things I enjoyed doing which are usually riddled with anxiety and panic. They made me forget the world ig. He was worried because he saw it happen before, he didn't want me to go through the same things people he knew did. I however was stupid and continued to lie to him that I wasn't doing anything. Today I woke up and just had a sudden realization: I was hurting him by using drugs. I was constantly making him worry over my well being, if I was safe, if I wasn't fucked up and taken advantage of. I felt horrible, I wanted to pull my skin out. I felt absolutely disgusted with myself for forcing him to care for me like a troubled teenager when I was just too selfish to quit.

So I broke up with him

He has threatened to leave before but he was begging me to find another way when I told him I didn't want to continue the relationship anymore. I love this man and maybe in the future if I better myself we can be together again but I also worry he'll find someone and realize how much I put him through. I miss him so much I want to ask him to talk to me but I know I'd be overbearing and selfish. I hate myself and I want to drown in my own tears

TL;DR I started using soft drugs and was too selfish to quit. I'm now on the verge of being an addict and I woke up this morning to realize I'm hurting my boyfriend, so I broke up with him",z2352j,2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z2352j/i_ruined_my_relationship_over_drugs/,relationships
226,I (25F) have a huge career opportunity but will need to break up with my boyfriend (27M).,"Made a burner account so I can rant about this and hopefully get some advice from people who are smarter than I am. This has been eating at me for the last week, and as pathetic as it is, has led to some binge drinking, so I figured I might as well ask for some help.

So, the title pretty much says it. I've been with my boyfriend (let's call him AJ) for about 8 months, and we were really good friends for almost 2 years before that. We suddenly found that we were newly single around the same time and the rest is history.

Mind you, I am absolutely not a stranger to relationships. I have been dating since I was 15, but nothing like what I feel for AJ. With every past relationship, after about a year or two goes by, I just get this feeling that they aren't the one I want to spend the rest of my life with, and eventually I end up breaking things off to continue on my amusing pursuit for true love. I don't have this feeling with him. For the first time I feel like he is ""the one"". I am very comfortable around him, we're goofy/silly with each other, and I love doing things for him, whether it's cooking, cleaning, giving him massages every night, or even little things like giving him a nice warm towel from the dryer every time he gets out of the shower. I help him work on his car in the heat and never complain because I just get to be around him. I think you get the idea.

Anyway, let me get to the point. So we work in the legal field at an upscale law firm, it's actually how we met. I have been offered to move states for the firm about 3 times, and this third time I had a total moment like, ""why am I continuing to let this opportunity pass me by? It has to be a sign."" So I accepted, formally applied for the position, and am now waiting for the interview process to come, but it's basically a guaranteed/sure thing. The city I would move to is about 4 1/2 hours away from where we live now.

The first thing I thought of is to ask him if he would want to come with me and he told me no. He has a lot of roots here (from his family who he's really close to, a business he owns, a club he manages, a ton of friends, and his job that he's spent the last 5+ years to get to where he is now). And I totally understood. I anticipated that this would be his response anyway. I don't have any of these things he does, I'm close with my mom, sister, and nephew, but leaving them for a new state/city is something I've done twice before. I don't have any local friends, the only two friends I have also live in different states. So I'm not giving up nearly as much as he would be.

He told me that if I do decide to move we can't and probably won't be together, which I found devastating and I start crying at the mere thought of it. I would be leaving in March and I have no idea what to do. He's told me he doesn't want me to go, he would miss me a lot, etc. But he also told me that if I do go he would understand, he won't hate me, and he'd be happy for me.

What should I do? Should I accept the position and come to terms with maybe we just aren't meant to be like I thought? Should I decline the position and stay here and be more or less unhappy at my job (constantly thinking about what the opportunity could've been?) then maybe search for a different firm? Or should I accept and ask him if he's willing to try long distance for at least a year with me? What should I do?

TL,DR: I have a huge career opportunity, 20% raise w/ billable time, in a new city/state but would lose what I feel is a true love. Should I stay with him or see what a new life has to offer?

He told me that he might be into men too, I was like okay, no big deal, my brother is gay so I don’t have problem with that, we have been intimate everything was good, when I was home we called each other all the time and everything was okay but in our third month of relationship he went for a weekend party with his friends (he’s very social and has lot of friends, I‘m introverted and have under five friends), everything was okay even tho I was scared because I had very toxic 4 year relationship before and I’m jealous a bit, but I assured myself that I got Lucky and I have nothing to worry about, I knew he would be drinking and he ended up trashed, it could be seen from messages too, I trusted him he wouldn’t do anything. He wrote me pretty much frequently, with sweet words and hearts so I was calm. Then we called on FaceTime after the weekend, we joked and talked about upcoming plans when I will visit. He wrote me sweetly when I was travelling to him. Then I arrived, I could see he was down a bit, he kissed me lightly, then we went to his place.
We sat in the kitchen when he told the dreaded sentence “I need to tell you something, I did something” my stomach went upside down, I Wanted to throw up, I immidiately knew… He told me cheated on me, with a gay man, his friend I met, in our bed we bought together, he slept in my bedding. As you can Imagine I lost my shit, I started screaming, crying, I was Absolutely disgusted, I couldnt look at him, touch him. He fucked him Without condom which is like absolute hell no in gay community because of std’s. I wanted to break up with him immidiately. I was pissed that he didnt have the balls to tell me before I had arrived and traveled six hours, spent money we talked like nothing was happening, he was sending me hearts and shit.
 After I calmed down a bit I heard him out why he did it, he told me he had issues with his orientation and after our confersation it became huge thing that bugged him, so he went and did it under influence of alcohol, and he says that after this he is sure that he likes women. He regrets that he didnt do it earlier, but Also told me he slept with his male best friend when he was like 17.
 Long story short, I gave him second and last chance. I had him tested for everything, thankfully it came back negative. We have few strict rules since then, like no alcohol or sleepovers outside or someone sleeps in his flat. He has no problems with that. 
But, I Also discovered that he watches transgender porn, (feminine person with male genitalia having sex with other or females) and I’m disgusted so much, it makes me question him, we talked about it, he says it’s not like that but like dude, What if I watched masculine person porn with vaginas, he expressed his disgust. Like its the same side of the coin. He Also watches a loooot of hardcore anal porn mainly with solo girls with monstrous toys. (Ew)
Since then I came on terms with it, now we are intimate again and have overall okay relationship.
I tried to be better in this relationship, I Want him to feel desire for me, I Want to fullfill at least somewhat What he likes, I sugested that we get some sort of toy so we got small butt plug, he plays with it and with me, we Also had our first anal sex together, which we have once a week now I thought maybe because he likes it that much he will enjoy sex with me more and idk will never do something stupid again. I let him record our anal and anal play in hopes of using our footage to jerk off not some (for me) disgusting types of porn but no he watches it still. I feel dumb, under appriciated and broken. I lost trust in him after he did that to me, I tried to talk to myself, I’m trying to trust him again. But I guess I’m scared and jealous, I Want to give him chance but I’m hurting so much. Every time I go home I’m so nervous he might do something behind my back. He doesn’t Want to talk about his porn or his preferences anymore. I guess he still likes the dick and tries to trick himself if Its on female body. But doesnt Want to tell me and I’m scared..
I’m lost, I don’t know if it’s healthy for my mental health and his to continue in this relationship, everything is fine exept this. He wants to be with me, but I don’t know if I can do it, one part wants to stay, it will be okay over time and second is like get the fuck out and don’t ever be in relationship again because it Hurts so so much and I will propably have massive trust issues onwards. On the other hand he does like nothing happened and life goes on no problem.

So, I basically don’t know What to do, How to get on terms with this situation, these feelings. I have been trying past months to overcome it, and I didnt have anybody to talk to so I need to vent it or I will go crazy. I need help, suggestion, anything… please

Thanks for reading.

228,Was my ex low-key emotionally abusive or just an asshole?,"I'm 27F and ex is 31/32M. Dating only for 4 months before blindsided breakup 

During a recent therapy session my therapist mentioned that it sounds like my ex was a bit abusive and that I didn't pick up on it while together. I was of the opinion (now) that he was just a bad person so it's thrown me for a loop. I have been abused before in the past so maybe she is just being cautious, but it's left me wondering about it so I'm keen for advice/opinions. (It was also a bdsm relationship if that has any relevance). 

Some examples from when we were together include: 
- Ex having to be in control of everything, only seeing him on his terms when it suited him. Only texting when it suited him. Being very firm that he wouldn't date anyone who didn't agree with his opinions on things. Even onions needed to be cut in a certain way when cooking etc..  
- Him being very fussy over physical appearance, saying he doesn't like curly hair, frizzy hair etc. Saying he was concerned about my acne incase it was permanent, that I wear a lot of makeup (due to the acne comment), asking about a missing tooth and saying he was glad I didn't lose it due to bad oral hygiene as he wouldn't date me if that was the reason. Bringing up the fact that I have stretch marks a lot. 
- Saying he wouldn't be dating me if my possible ADHD/Autism was worse (on waiting list for diagnosis)
- Me mentioning I'll come round with my hair tied up the next time and him going ""absolutely not"", before later explaining he might not like what it looks like without my hair framing my face. (I did see him a few times after that with it up, and he didn't say anything about it apart from once mentioning ""I thought you didn't wear it up often?"") 
- Saying communication was important and that I could tell him anything, and that he'd prefer to know if there were any issues. But then saying I was needy for wanting to talk about an issue that came up and that asking for reassurance was not a good thing. 
- Hinting that I was clingy/dependent for texting a few times a day but then also saying he's happy with how much we communicate


Also some sexual examples from early on in the relationship include: 
- Being aware that i didn't want/was uncomfortable with ongoing casual sex due to past traumas and accepting it but then trying for sex while in person, me saying no/the safe word and pushing him away, him accepting it and then trying again 5 minutes later. Repeat 3/4 times until I give up and go with it. This happened a few times until we got into an official relationship and I was more happy to have sex. 
- Needing to the take the morning after pill 2/3 times after pressure to remove condoms in heated moments due to them reducing feeling for him leading to me saying it was okay when it was strongly agreed to not do that beforehand, especially after the first time it happened (this one is probably my fault, I know). This stopped because I went on birth control as I felt it would continue to happen if I didn't.


I'm aware that I allowed most of this behaviour to happen due to not holding strong boundaries and it is something that I am working hard on so please no comments about that. All I'm asking for is options on whether this was a possibly abusive-ish relationship or normal asshole behaviour for someone who isn't really into you. Thank you for your help :)

229,Sister Struggles,"I (17F) have a twin sister (17F). We've been having some difficulty over this one petty thing.

I like to switch seats in one class, but she has made it clear that she does not want me to sit in the row behind her. When I say it doesn't matter, she accuses me of wanting to look at her computer and report anything sketchy to my parents. Granted, when I was younger (like elementary school), there were times I would tell on her, but now that we're older, I don't snitch on her unless my parents flat-out ask me to tell them the truth.

I understand that she doesn't trust me, but I think I should still be able to sit where I want. She basically said if I sit there she will move my stuff somewhere else. And she has done it several times. And we continue to get irritated with each other. How do I rectify this? 

I realize part of this is my fault, but it has crossed into somewhat ""manipulative"" and ""hurtful"" statements on her part. I definitely am trying to rebuild trust, but I don't know how to improve the situation.

230,Am I just overthinking very minor stuff? (24m) (22f),"I'm 24, her 22.

I'll put it simple: I overthink badly. My girlfriend can be affectionate, caring, say she loves me and misses me, but the moment she isn't, I panic mentally. I never bring these things up with her but still.

While apart, we tend to mention or send each other Instagram posts with cute relationship quotes every so often.

Yesterday I found a post that said ""I love my girl exactly how she is"" and put her @ in the comments underneath. Normally, she'd acknowledge this and reply with a heart, a kiss emoji or whatever. This time she didn't acknowledge it and it made me flat that she isn't as into me anymore or something. We've still texted in the meantime, she said she loved me two days ago, but is her not acknowledging this a bad thing or am I just being my typical, overthinking self?

**TL;DR: mentioned girlfriend under a cutesy Instagram post. We usually send these to each other every so often and always acknowledge them. She didn't do that this time and not I'm worrying it means she doesn't like me anymore**",z28eff,1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z28eff/am_i_just_overthinking_very_minor_stuff_24m_22f/,relationships
231,What are the best next steps?,"33(F) American hopelessly in love with 33(M) Australian.

We met through mutual friends, started dating in 2020. Our relationship has been exclusively long distance due to COVID-19 except for a few visits in between.  I visited him this year and liked Australia enough to picture myself living there with him. We initially planned to get married by early 2023 (Jan-Feb) and apply for partner visa. Now, he's changed his stance and requested we live together in Australia for a year before getting married. I'm very hesitant to do so because of the incredible amount of risk I'd have to take. Move across the world from family and friends, give up an amazing job and rent or sell my place, all to trial this out. If he decides to change his mind about us when I'm there, his life would be relatively unchanged whereas I'd be left to pick up the pieces. We had decided from the beginning for me to move after we got married. Now with this change, how do I find the best way forward?

I have enjoyed our time together but once we started dating we did LDR for 4 months in the summer and we've done 2 months LDR during college because he transferred schools. We see each other pretty often but I have started to get annoyed by the little things he does. His love language is physical touch but I have started to get irritated by it. Another thing is that when he comes up to see me during the weekends, I don't want to be intimate/sexual and I don't know why. I truly enjoying spending my time with him because I can truly be myself but I have started to feel less connected.

I am confused on what to because this is the first time in almost a year where I felt understood but I'm scared that the spark is not there anymore. He's a good guy, and I know his feelings towards me are the same since we started talking/dating.

233,How do I deal with my fiance 's brother's "friend" nagging about cleaning.,"My (26F) fiance (27M) and his twin brother lives together in a house that their parents bought for them. Their mom do come by and stay for a few momths per year. I do sleep over from time to time around 2-3 days a week. Anyways my fiance 's brother (27M) met a new girl (30F) a year ago.   He told me they are just ""friends"" but kinda dating with no label as he doesn't want to commit yet. His female friend usually comes and sleeps over around 5-6 days a week. There are months that she would sleep there for a whole month since she wants to save money for the rent. My fiance 's mom told me the ""friend"" wants to move there completely and pay for rent but she refused. 

The problem started when she messaged me few nights ago on instagram saying that she would like ""the common area"" to be kept clean as it was when my fiance's mom is there. She also said that she doesn't mind their food and drinks being eaten by us but does not appreciate leaving the garbage for her to clean up after, saying ""it's not nice"". She also thank me for cleaning the kitchen after I cook every time. I'm pretty surprised about the message as she never utter a single word whenever we pass by each other. Anyways I replied that I never ate or drink any food of hers and about the cleaning she should talk directly to my fiance as it is not my responsibility to clean up after him. (My fiance talked to me before about cleaning and said it is his responsibility and that I don't have to do anything as I already cook and spend time with him in between of my busy schedule). She replied that she doesn't want to feel like she's a maid of the house, cleaning up after everyone. I've let my Fiance know about the message and he messaged his brother about it saying that I never eat or drink any of their food and that if she have any problems with cleaning it should be him she should talk to. His brother messaged me and stated that he have no problems of me eating his food (if i ever did) as I also make him food sometimes and that he had no idea at all that she messaged me. At the end, she did apologized for making assumptions and the sudden message. However, I noticed since then she started leaving small notes around the house for my fiance or would pass the message through my fiance's brother to tell him to clean up something he missed or to throw away garbage. It's making us uncomfortable around the house doing normal things, like cooking or even just hanging out in the living room thinking she might judge us after. I told my fiance to talk to her or even to his brother about it, but he said that he wants to avoid conflict and drama. I am really bothered by this, but I'm not sure if I should confront her or if it is better to talk to my fiance's brother first.




Tl;dr: My fiance's brother's ""friend"" is nagging about cleaning, leaving notes and passes messages about things that needs to be cleaned around my fiance's own house. It makes us feel uncomfortable, but fiance doesn't want conflict or drama so he tolerates it.  I want to confront her or my fiance's brother about it but I'm not sure how or if it's a good idea.",z1wfhw,4,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z1wfhw/how_do_i_deal_with_my_fiance_s_brothers_friend/,relationships
234,I feel hurt because bf didn't invite me to a party,"
I (31F) have dated my boyfriend (42M) for about 9 months. We currently live 4h from each other but I am moving to his city in January (he lives in my old hometown).

On average we have been able to meet up 2-3 times/month. He also has a 3 y o son whom I met a couple of times. We are both serious about the relationship and are ""official"". I've met his parents and a few of his friends.

Next weekend he said he cannot meet up as he has to attend his sister's birthday party. I am hurt because he didn't invite me. This means we won't be able to see each other for at least two weeks. I am sad he is more okay with that than inviting me to her party. Most people there will be friends of his sister. I feel I cannot push this because it's up to him who he invites, but I'm hurt and questioning things.

He keeps telling he's in love with me but shouldn't he want to ""show me off"" if that's the case?

235,My bf can’t handle his emotions or drinking,"My bf (22) and I (22) have been dating for almost a year and have had some issues with drinking. If he’s drunk and one of us makes a bad joke or I’m offended then the whole night is ruined for him and it’s impossible to get thru. Granted I’m pretty emotionally avoidant and he’s sensitive and emotional. It’s happened like maybe twice where it’s a really bad night and a sh*tshow so the last time I told him I’m not doing this again and made it extremely clear.
 He tried not drinking and if he would, he’d ask if I’m ok/uncomfortable and it’s been fine until this weekend.

 My best friend who I haven’t seen since 2016 flew in to visit for a weekend and the last night he was here we all went out for drinks and got drunk. Towards the end of the night I guess something went wrong for my bf and he was very quiet and drunk and I knew there’s no talking to him and kinda avoided him cause I wanted to have fun with my friend. 
We made it back to my apartment where he was embarrassingly drunk in front of my 2 cousins and dropped a box of donuts so my friends friend helped him clean it. Then my bf just went to my room where my cousin went to talk to him for a while (he also said he has no clue what was wrong and thought he was just too drunk) and I stayed with my friend cause he was literally packing to leave.

 After my friends left, I noticed my bf was in the shower for a really long time (40 min, usually takes 15) so I finally went in and he was passed out in the tub. Idk something really broke just seeing him there, I turned off the water and he silently got up and got changed. I realized later he accidentally broke so many things in my bathroom too. At this point it’s 3-4am he’s trying to pack and leave while crying and apologizing, I’m just dissociating n numb. The next day I barely spoke to him noticed he was crying but kinda ignored it and he left. 

I told him to give me space and let me think cause I really thought about just ending it right there. Idk I love him he’s sweet and caring but I put up with so much shit with my ex also being unable to control his emotions that I really have no mental space to be able to care for others in that regard. Is it worth giving him another chance? He also said he felt unloved and uncared for the weeks prior and I felt the same way, we said we’d work on it but now this happens. I feel like I’m being too harsh but at the same time I need to have some respect for myself?? Help lol.

237,I(m30) have feelings for my friend(f30) but she doesnt feel the same way. Neither does my girlfriend.,"That headline really is something huh?

Background: my best friend and I met when we were teenagers. We didn't have the best or smoothest start to our friendship as I had the biggest crush on her and it made me act weird. 

As the time passed on, we started to talk more and more. We spent hours talking via blurry webcams. Then slowly drifted apart for sometime as she started partying and dating. That time was pretty difficult because as an answer to this I tried to develop crushes to other girls but no one came close to making me feel what she made me feel.

After years passed on I tried to ""get over her by getting on top of someone else""
Later that someone turned out to be the woman I have spent years together with.

My current partner:
First few years or our relationship were great. Then suddenly things changed and we started to get to that point where we are more of roommates than partners.
For me closeness and conversations are important but she's not into that
And to be honest, I don't think she has had any feelings towards me for the past few years.
This has caused my brain to go to that familiar ""what if"" - place, where I plan out a life with my best friend.

Unfortunately my friend has never or will never feel the way about me as I feel about her. But my partner is also getting more distant while I try to still make it work and forget what ifs.

Now that I think of it. Im in the middle of two women and neither one of them has any sort of romantic feelings towards me.

I feel like im a cheater, yet a victim, I feel lonely and un-loveable. Im very most mentally and I cant seem to pull myself together and move the frick on.

Have you ever been in a situation like this?

We see each other everyday mostly because of a shared job but we don’t talk (We went no contact since the breakup) and I don’t know what to do. We were so similar in sense of humor, personalities, music- literally everything and I felt like I met my match. It ended and I just don’t know what to do now- do I contact him? He ended it so is it on him to reach out? It hasn’t even been that long. I’m focusing on myself right now but the thought of ‘what if’ since I’ve been working on issues that ended us has been in my head. I know we could make it work because we both want the same things of the future. Do I give him more time and space or do I reach out now to try to keep or restart a now healthier relationship? Or is it on him to reach out because he ended it, even though he’s an avoidant? I truly know it could work out.

(she literally groaned like a child at us getting back together). so on the topic of her not liking me again, my boyfriend tells me that the other day she said to him “i used to be like her once and i know how much it stresses people out so i’m going to call you a lot” (we were supposed to be moving in together soon). honestly i find this statement really offensive. this woman hasn’t met me even once nor ever even spoken to me. to me it feels like she’s saying “i know people like her can be a burden so i’m going to check she isn’t affecting you too badly a lot” (i really struggle with mental health issues which is what she would be referring to here) and a couple people i’ve spoken to about this completely agree that it sounds like that. when i told my boyfriend this is how i felt about it he got mad and started defending her saying i was taking it out of context, that she was just worried about him, that she worries about my mental health (which i dont understand this conclusion at all), ect. i’m worried that if we continue the relationship then his mum will continue to be rude about me and he will continue to invalidate my feelings on it. i love my boyfriend with all my heart and don’t even want to consider breaking up with him but i’m honestly scared of this happening. what should i do?

241,I (17m) feel like I want to break up with my girlfriend (17f),"I’ve been thinking about writing about this here for a long time now so here it goes. I apologise for any bad formating and grammar since i’m on my phone and sorry if it’s too long.

Basically me and my gf have been together now for almost a year and a half. We became classmates at the start of highschool and during covid we started talking a lot and eventually we started dating. It was going great for some time but for months now I’ve been feeling kinda idk trapped almost I guess. The worst part is that i don’t think it’s really her fault i think it’s mine. Every time I start thinking about life and plans and things I want to do it messes me up because I feel like like it takes away some freedom. Like I can’t just go to a party and get f’d up and make out with a random girl and forget about it the next day obviously. But these are still things I think I want to experience as a 17year-old.

On top of all of that there’s also other things, her mental health is really bad, she suffers from anxiety and pretty severe panic attacks, her psychologist was mentioning some signs of depression and I’m also a bit scared of her hurting herself since she has mentioned suicide a couple of times before. She also often gets mad at me for things that really don’t seem like that big of a deal and the thing is she never gets mad at others like not a single time but for me she’ll find even the smallest things that i do wrong and demand i apologise (she even found some formula that i have to stick to when apologising).

Also her mental health problems affect her grades in school and there have been many occasions where i felt like a tutor working for free basically and of course i want to help her if i can but then she would yell at me when i couldn’t properly explain stuff like it’s my job to do it. It also doesn’t help when she’s constantly saying how nobody ever puts her needs first and such and her family doesn’t help the situation because she has 6 siblings and they usually cause her to be in an even worse mood. The thing is though i do trust her fully with everything and i can’t even imagine my life without her but i just can’t have everything.

Anyway i’m just so tired of the constant arguing and feeling like crap just because I don’t know if i’m ready to commit to a serious relationship at 17 years-old. If anyone wants any more details/information feel free to ask in the comments.

242,I (22 ftm) can’t deal with falling in love for the first time,"So, about 5 months ago I started treating my social anxiety with psychotherapy. It helped me so much that I was finally able to start going out with people, having casual sex and going on dates (one of my big fears before treatment).

Back in August I started talking to this guy (24 m) on grindr and we got along pretty well. Because of both of us going through some shit for at the time (like moving apartments and college) it took a while for us to meet, but, when we did, it was amazing. We both loved how it went and started talking more, getting to know each other and planning more dates. 

He was cool with the fact that I am a gay ftm (he’s bisexual), we have similar interests, like spending time together, have great sex and good dynamics… It has been all around incredible. *But*, he’s my first in many (MANY) regards. First time I ever cuddled with someone, first time I ever showered with someone, first time I held hands with someone on the street, first time I tried different things sexually etc. I also know that that’s not the case for him. He has been on long-lasting relationships before, been on multiple dates, had many sexual experiences and poly relationships. This disbalance makes me a little bit insecure, but my feelings for him scare me even more. 

We have talked about the fact that we have feelings for each other and I have mentioned I was “falling in love with him”, but I feel so much for him all the time it has started to scare me. I’ve always been a pretty independent guy (had to be a lot of the time because of social anxiety) and the thought of feeling this much for someone makes me terrified. For me, the actual fear is that I’ll lose him because I can’t handle the intensity of what I feel for him and how emotionally immature I feel because of it. 

I can’t help but think of him during the day, text him, talk about him to my friends and family and miss him when we go a few days without seeing each other. I feel like a teenager from a cheesy romance novel or something. 

I also think he doesn’t feel the same way. Maybe he did when he was 16 and had his first girlfriend, but not now at 24 after going out with someone for a few months. I do know he likes me and has feelings for me, but I am very inclined to believe they are not as intense as my feelings for him.

Considering this, I guess I have some questions for people that have more experience with relationships: Is this what falling in love is actually like? Am I becoming too emotionally attached to him? It this whole think normal? What did it feel like the fist time you fell in love compared to falling in love later? 

TLDR: falling in love for the first time at 22 makes me feel like a scared teenager.",z263ee,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z263ee/i_22_ftm_cant_deal_with_falling_in_love_for_the/,relationships
243,Advice breaking up with girl I love but personal lives not compatible," So i'm in a situation where I've been with this girl for a while and I love the girl and I'm sure she loves me also and she's very pleasant to be with. But I kinda put myself in this position which I take full accountability which is I have businesses where I make good amount of money and I never told her about them in full detail and she has never seen anything fancy from my life because sometimes i'm paranoid girls will get compelled by the money when I meet them. Now I do love the girl but the work gets in the way which it always has been the case but more now and past 2-3 weeks, we had small fights and I think I picked them to have a reason to break up with her because usually i never pick arguments over small things. And I did break up with her and then she messaged me a couple days later and I met up with her and we have been hanging out for a few days, its been good but that doesn't change I will travel a lot and she can't come with me she will be busy going to school and taking care of her mother. I obviously made a mistake getting back with her even though me breaking up over such small thing was justified I just used it as an excuse and obviously I got back with her because I do love her. I will break up with her that is the solution because our personal lives are not compatible at this moment but every time I think of how to do it, what to say I get stuck in my thoughts. I have never broken up with a girl where she hasn't done anything wrong and that I like at the same time and that part makes it tougher. Any advice?

244,Will this work out?,"I (F23) have been with my boyfriend (M29) since last 3 years. 

Year #1 - Talking phase - Was very volatile for us where I used to block him and not talk for a couple days, sometimes 10-15 days at a stretch. As someone who retracts and goes into a cocoon, I want to be left alone instead of talking and arguing more and I don't want someone to pamper me for acting up bcs i feel it is my responsibility to sort out myself and my emotions. During this time I must have said a few harsh things over his incompetence, lousy job and lifestyle. He is VERY traumatised by this it seems.

Year #2 - Committed - New problems arise as we figure each other out more and spend more time. Sex is alright. One of his complaints being I never initiate. And my complaint being he used to do it even when I didn't feel like it and I always gave in bcs he wanted to (I don't want him to be grateful for that but he almost never acknowledges how tough and traumatising that was for me) 
Also I was a virgin when I met him and so was he. 

Year #3 - He's 29 and at an age where he should rightfully marry so I enquired whether he wants to take this forward. He said he'll marry anyone but me. Also he recently disclosed that he had decided he won't be marrying me in year #1 itself post seeing our ups and down. I argued that it was our talking phase, people are indecisive and can't commit easily. But having had no dating experience before this, he just believes what he is living and feeling.

I really love this dude. I don't care what we say or what we do and how. I believe if you find someone you can tolerate even slightly, dig in ur nails and don't let go.
Also we're conservative as a couple but also equally liberal in other matters. Our ideologies match beautifully. It's rare to find someone with the perfect balance bcs I've talked to a looooot of men and none came close.

What to do? He says he is fed up and done. I feel so too sometimes. But should we let go this easily? I know I'll be pretty devasted if that happens (been there once, close call)


How do I make him stay?

245,Am I (27F) insecure for not wanting to be friends with my gf’s (27F) ex?,"TLDR; My girlfriend wants to try being friends with her ex but I am feeling conflicted about it even though I trust that she would never betray me with her ex.

My girlfriend (A) dated her ex (B) for two years and they were broken up for a year before she and I started dating. We are all women if that helps anybody’s perspective on this situation. B broke up with A because B wanted to “explore her options” and didn’t want to be committed to A. B continued to string A along after breaking up with her until A finally had enough and completely cut things off from B. Then a year later A and I met each other and we’ve been together for 3 years since. 

Aside from the occasional check-in from B, they were not in contact until a month ago when B reached out to A asking if enough time has passed for them to be friends. I thought it was kind of suspicious as B had just gotten out of a year long relationship when she reached out. A had been very lonely lately as she’s lost a lot of friends due to incompatibility and she’s been chronically ill too. A asked me if we could try becoming friends with B as she really wants a friend she can vent to about all the health problems she’s been going through. I was fine with it albeit, a bit uncomfortable and distrusting of B’s intentions. We discussed boundaries to make sure I am comfortable with the situation and we started to hang out with B from there. 

So far things were good but the boundaries had been pushed a couple of times when I did not want to hang out with B because I was busy with work (I am the breadwinner). A boundary I set was that A would not hang out with B by herself until I am comfortable with their friendship. I was pressured into spending time with B and A even though I was swamped with work just so A wouldn’t break my boundary. Another time B came over to our apartment to play board games and she stayed until 3:30am even though A and I’ve given plenty of hints that it’s getting too late and she should go home. A and I then agreed that B can only stay over until 1:30am the latest then I should tell B that it’s getting late and we need to rest. That did not happen the next time B had come over. All three of us were drinking while playing games but I stopped drinking when I felt like I had enough. It was almost 2am and I said it was getting late I’m going to head to bed. B said goodnight and A said she would come to bed soon too. They ended up getting even more drunk together and B even slept over on the couch because she was too drunk to drive home. Obviously, I wouldn’t make a drunk person drive home so I felt like I was cornered into a situation of putting aside my boundaries so B wouldn’t drive drunk. A came to bed with me around 4:30am and B didn’t leave until around 2pm the next day. I was very unhappy with what happened and A apologized profusely saying how she’s extremely depressed and it was nice to have a friend she could vent to.

One of our mutual friends had a birthday party over the weekend and A invited B to join us. I wasn’t ecstatic about that but whatever. During the party A and B got drunk again and it almost felt like I was third wheeling them. A is a very physically affectionate person when she’s drunk. She was hugging our friends, touching their arms and etc. That I don’t mind at all but then she was doing the same thing with B which made me really uncomfortable. I told A about how I felt like I was the friend and they were the couple at our friend’s party and A apologized saying that she was trying to make sure B wouldn’t be left out in the friend group as it seemed like I was leaving her out. This didn’t sit right with me because it seemed like A tried to hard to make B feel comfortable that it ended up making me feel uncomfortable.

We had taken some group photos at the party and I joked with A that I want to crop B out of the photos so I wouldn’t have any pics of her on my phone. A asked me if I hated B, and honestly I don’t. I hate that A is drinking excessively again because we’ve been hanging out with B. A used to abuse alcohol when she was with B and she had a difficult time staying sober because B would always pressure her into drinking. B is constantly on substances (weed, shrooms, alcohol) so she can deal with her issues which I thought was really unhealthy. Other than that, I can see that B does not have any other intentions besides a 100% platonic friendship with A and same with A. I trust that A would not cheat on me with B and A constantly reassures me that she loves me and she would never get back together with B even if we break up.

Sorry for the long read. At the end of all this, I just don’t want to be friends with B. She’s nice, funny and I do have fun playing games with her and A. A said that I felt this way because I’m insecure and jealous but I’m wondering if I don’t want to be friends with B is really because I’m insecure?",z1yxju,2,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z1yxju/am_i_27f_insecure_for_not_wanting_to_be_friends/,relationships
246,I’m not sure what to do about my friend (25f) who has high expectations from me (24f),"I am my best friends only friend and it’s really starting to show. To give a bit of a background - when she was kicked out of home, I took her in. When she needed money, I gave her it. I’ve also been supporting her emotionally since the start. I have been her only constant, ever. She has a bad relationship with her family, they’ve never gotten along and her mother was abusive. She even told me that I’m more of a sister than her own blood relatives.

Every now and again, she brings up things from years ago, such as times when I have been unwell mentally and was therefore unable to be there for anyone else. Years ago when this was happening, she could see that I was struggling and also tried to support me but didn’t fully understand and says that I use my mental issues as an excuse for everything, including not being there for her and one of the times she mentioned was when she was pregnant and I was severely depressed to the point my mother nearly admitted me to hospital.

To this day, this girl still owes me money from four years ago but I don’t harass her for it because I know she has priorities such as her child. Since I’ve been doing much better, I’ve also carried on being the best friend I can be and supporting her out of love but because I am her only friend, she leans on me all the time and it’s a lot of pressure for one person. She gets annoyed at me sometimes when I’m busy and not able to answer her phone calls.

What I’m getting at is, is that any time I haven’t been able to be there for her, she seems to punish me for it, taunts me with the past and accuses me of not caring and even compares me to relationships she sees on tiktok and says she wishes we were like them lol? Now I just feel like nothing I ever do can be good enough for her. She even said that the time I took her in, when she was homeless for a year, that I didn’t do it because I loved her… apparently I did it because I pitied her.

It’s upset me that she has thrown back the times I have helped her in my face and makes me feel like she’s ungrateful. I don’t get why she keeps mentioning things that I did or didn’t do years ago. I have tried to talk to her about this but she gets defensive and says I’m acting spoilt cause it wasn’t that serious. It’s just the fact that this is like the 10th time she’s brought it up over the years of knowing her.

TLDR: I feel like my best friend doesn’t appreciate me and I’m not sure how I should approach this situation anymore.",z24nbj,1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z24nbj/im_not_sure_what_to_do_about_my_friend_25f_who/,relationships
247,The way my bf acts with my cat makes me uncomfortable. (19f) (23M),"So I’ve been with him for over a year and we sleep over eachothers place almost everyday. I recently got a cat 2 months ago and I don’t like how my bf acts with it.

My bf is a person with anxiety so he uses the cat to help him when he’s at my house. Even when the cat doesn’t want to be with him he forces the cat to sleep next to him, while the cat hisses at him and whines but eventually calms down and falls asleep. 

Also most of the time we are together he makes the cat sit with us with whatever we’re doing. Sometimes the cat will even come to the bed with us and lay at our feet and he takes the cat just to lay with him and the cat runs from him most of the time. When it’s just me and the cat, she sleeps right next to me willingly without me having to take her and he’s just super rough with her in general. She’s 5 months btw. I tried to tell him he should be more patient with her and he says he knows but he wants her to be next to him “now”. Like instead of taking the time to build trust. He says “sometimes he needs affection from something that doesn’t understand affection”

I can deal with that but one thing that frustrates me and makes me uncomfortable is sometimes when he’s holding the cat he gives her a degree of affection that i feel isn’t normal for a cat. Like the kind of affection you’d see with a human couple. Like he makes these moaning noises while hugging the cat and is constantly rubbing his head up and down her body (not in her private area but on her back and on the side) and talks to her like he would talk to me if we were cuddling (but i also talk to her in a baby voice). Like the kind of thing that makes u feel like wtf is this guy doing.

So today he was doing it and i was feeling super uncomfortable and i said “dude can u stop acting so sensual with the cat, there’s affection and then there’s that. it looks like this from the outside” and he got super mad and said i was doing too much.

I admit now that sensual wasnt the word to use. I just didn’t know how else to get him to understand that it makes me uncomfortable. Since I tried to tell him before and he just laughs and says i’m jealous.

tldr; boyfriend is too touchy with my cat and it makes me uncomfortable. i told him the wrong way and now he’s mad.",z24fmu,1,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z24fmu/the_way_my_bf_acts_with_my_cat_makes_me/,relationships
248,"My (21/M) mother (51/F) has hallucinations at night, that are getting worse."," Hello,

My mom has been getting these hallucinations for more than a year, but they have been getting worse these past days, she shouts for me to get over and turn on the light or telling me something. I'd turn on the light and she's feeling the pillow infront for something then tells me to go to sleep. They typically happen very soon after she goes to sleep, i'm guessing when shes falling asleep.

It used to be she only saw lights or something in the dark, but last night she was imagining smells and saying ""someone is doing experiments again"" and things like that.

During the day time she is 100% normal, coherent and very active, working, but it always freaks me out. She has a lot of stress from pursuing an additional degree, but how much does that really contribute? We've been under a lot more stress and this didn't happen.

We don't talk about them, honestly I always forget them after sleeping until now. Months ago I had actually remembered and tried bringing it up, but she dismissed it and didn't want to talk about it.

What should I do honestly? It freaks me out for her sake. We have some mental illness in the family, her brother/my uncle had psychosis if I'm not mistaken and has been in institutions. But unlike my mother he abused cocaine and other drugs. My mother is completely straight edge, drinking at most 3 times a year and a couple drinks at that.

My girlfriend (23) is still in college and when i met her 4 months ago, I told her i was still in college too. I've told her i went to college when i went to work, i've pretended to study, I've pretended to be stressed about exams. This has been going on for 4 months and i feel terrible about it. I guess i did it, because i've had a messed up last couple of years and i've been trying to get my life back together. I will go back to college at some point. I suppose i just didn't want her to think i was a loser. I love her very much, but if i tell her i've been deceiving her like this she'll be hurt and likely break up with me. I know I can't keep this lie up much longer and it'll be worse when she finds out by herself. I've thought about just breaking up with her and not telling her, because if she finds out she'll break up with me anyway. This way she'll be less hurt. I don't know what to do. College is very important to her and her family, she even broke up with her last boyfriend because she felt he wasn't serious enough about his education.

250,Trouble Processing Breakup 1 Year Later,"    TL;DR; Broke up with my ex 1 year ago and still struggling with why I did. Not sure if I did the right thing. His career indecisiveness and inability to fit in with family made me question if we were the right fit. Objective advice on gaining closure? 

My (28f) and my ex (28m) dated long distance \~2 years starting right before the pandemic. We were extremely serious, to the point of looking at engagement rings together. Calling off the relationship was the hardest thing I've ever done, and it wasn't crystal clear to me then why I was doing it other then it felt off and I didn't feel peace with the relationship anymore. I was hoping in time I'd gain clarity... but I haven't.

I loved this man because he is humble, generous, extremely thoughtful, and made me smile all the time when we were together. That is, when we were alone or in 'his turf'. Once he was outside of what was comfortable (his routine, his environment, and in mine around my family/ friends), he started struggling with his own mental health.. and that took a toll on mine. In groups of people, he' get depressed and anxious, to the point that he'd shut down and be unable to make eye contact with others or carry a conversation (this happened around my family for an entire wedding weekend and was a catalyst in us breaking up). I had trouble reconciling how perfect we were for each other when we were alone versus how he was around others.

Over time, I got in my head (also due to family comments that are hard to ignore) and had trouble seeing him as someone who would fit into my family, since family is extremely important to me.

There were other factors, such as his job and ambition. He questioned his career choice every day for 2 years and I tried supporting him in finding what he would be better suited for. When he changed careers, he gave up on that within 2 months, and went back to retail. Money is not the most important thing, but I still worry about finance. When we started dating I knew he was in retail. I'm a teacher and took on 2 after school jobs to start saving up for a wedding and a future, but he didn't have the same concerns about money. Ultimately, his indecisiveness and complaining about his job felt like too much for me to handle while I felt like I was working overtime to create a future together.

This man was good and I loved him. Were the reasons I listed enough to call it off? I still miss him.",z23vit,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z23vit/trouble_processing_breakup_1_year_later/,relationships
251,My bf seems to be struggling with his self esteem.,"I am 27F and dating 28m. 

So I met him in highschool and I really liked him back then. He always seemed so happy and had a huge bright smile. He was so sweet and kind. I had a huge crush on him but never said anything because he didn't seem to like me more than in a friendly nature. 

Ffwd some years and we started dating about 10 months ago. I really do like him. He makes an effort to know everything I like, he is so sweet to me. He's funny too, he makes me laugh until my ribs hurt. He takes me on dates that are so much fun. Sex with him is always fantastic because he puts a lot of effort into making sure I enjoy myself. We also have a lot of the same hobbies and interests so conversation is never lacking. He is just fun and good. 

 I see glimpses of how he was. He is still very friendly and kind with an easy going nature but he doesn't smile like he used to and always seems kind of sad and more shy than he used to be. I noticed when we first started talking again that he just wasn't as happy as he used to be. 

He has always been a big guy he's tall and a little overweight. I've never cared that he was overweight, he has always been and it didn't lessen my attraction to him. However he is very insecure about it and has asked me several times why I want to be with him when he looks the way he does. I think he is very handsome. He has a very charming and soft look about him. Like someone you can trust and want to cuddle with. 

I've told him I like how he looks but if he wanted to go to the gym or try to lose weight I would help and am supportive if it's what he wants to do. He has started working out at the gym when I go and has been walking with me and it seems to be improving his overall view of himself.

He also struggles with a lot of other things about his appearance and some sexual things. The only thing he seems confident about are his hobbies and his job. Most physical abilities he seems confident in. 

Honestly I don't know what happened to the guy I met way back then. It's like someone got in his head and now he has lost all of that confidence. I'm not sure how to help him get it back either. 

Is there anything I can do to help him see him the way I see him?

253,My (23f) bf (23m) of 2 months is weirdly controlling of mundane things?,"Ill give a few examples but I will start with the one from yesterday. 

We’ve been together for 2 months for context and since we started he hates the fact that I drink pepsi. Like im talking lectures me on it every time he sees me drinking it. 

Last night I grabbed one after dinner and he said “didnt you already have one at work? No thats enough”. He took it away from me and it was all like jokingly at first and I was just like man come on give me the can back. He proceeded to get up dump the can out and go to the pepsi case in my garage and hide the rest of my pepsi around my house and when I was starting to feel like it was ridiculous and told him to cut it out he said “see? Pepsi turns you into some sort of crackhead you have an addiction”. 

I honestly felt really sad so I just went quiet and he was again saying “look how ridiculous you’re getting over pepsi this is exactly why im taking it away” and when I got up he held me down. We play wrestle a bit so this isnt too out of ordinary but I just kept fighting back and it got kind of aggressive until I had to yell at him to stop and let me go. He told me I was acting childish and honestly, maybe I was being childish im not sure. I did apologize to him for acting out and giving him the silent treatment but he also wants me to apologize for drinking pepsi in front of him. 

The next thing that happened was that I was listening to rap music and he started off joking that it was bad but it escalated into him saying “I am being serious I just don't like or want that music or anyone who likes that type of shit” and when I said I will stop listening to rap he said “Please do, I just really dislike those type of music and I'll lose so much respect that I have for you if it's something you frequently listen too and I'm sorry I have to police that”. 

I don’t know. I know these sound really silly but I just have this feeling there’s something more concerning about these behaviours.

She went to hang out with her boyfriend, Andrew(16? Same grade) two days ago. Afterwards she went to our grandpa's house. He lives an hour away from our house by bus. But from where Maya said she was with, when she was with Andrew, it could've taken about 2 hours (after covid the bus routes got weird). 

Later that day our grandpa called me and told me Maya came to his house and is gonna stay with him for a while. She does go to our grandpa's house on occasion to just hang out. But she's never randomly went to his house and refused to come out. M 32(John) and M29(Sam) recently came to hang out. And they both said she seemed fine. 

I tried to face time Maya but she never picked up, she did call and say she was fine. I asked about her boyfriend. She said it was fine, but not to come visit. Our grandpa said she was fine and not to come over until she's ready.

When we were just friend we didn't talk much, maybe a few times a year or so but it was one of the healthiest relationship that I had. Whenever we'd talk, we'd talk for hours and we deeply cared about each other but we both are the kind of people who need space.

When our relationship escalated, we started talking more frequently and things were pretty good. We still needed our own time sometimes and we both respected that very much, I always remind him that I'm there for him but if he also needs to be alone for awhile I don't mind as long as he let me know he's alright. 

I noticed recently that sometimes he won't answer me for a week but his snapchat score will increase or he'll like stuff on instagram... I asked him about it because it was bothering me and he told me sometimes he's just not feeling right and doesn't wanna talk about his problems all the time and make every conversation about that so he just chooses not to reply until he feels better. I reassured him that I love him and will be more than there for him if he needs me and that loving him means being there through his problems even if he needs me to listen to him talk about them for a year straight. 

Anyway, I did notice him opening up more and making efforts to tell me whenever he needs time instead of just ignoring my texts. 

Recently he's been afk more often since he started school again and he also broke his phone (he doesn't have any money to buy a new one right now but he's saving). However, today I learned through a mutual friend that he was in a discord call with some old friends of his... he hasn't been answering me for four days and at the time of the call, he was suppose to be at school... he was also using a mic in voice chat but claims he doesn't have one on his computer and always needs to borrow his mom's phone whenever he wants to call me but usually waits until she sleeps to take it and at the time of the call, she was surely not sleeping. 

I don't know what to do. Whenever we talk, our relationship is super healthy and it's the first one I've ever had in which I feel comfortable. I really trust this guy and I'm not usually a naive person... I feel like he really loves me, he opens up to me like he never opened up to anyone and he's been with me through rough times too and supported me. His love just seems and feel so real that I couldn't see how he'd be lying but then he does things like this that make me doubt him. 

Am I worrying for nothing? Am I just overthinking this? What should I do?

256,I'm not sure I'm sexually attracted to my partner,"TL;DR I love my partner but am unsure of my physical attraction to them.

Little confession thing here on an alt account, but as the title states, I'm not sure I'm sexually attracted to my partner. We're both in our late 20s, early 30s and we've 9nly been together a short time which is why I'm here.

Everything else about her is absolutely perfect. We're the same kind of nerdy, she loves and supports me unconditionally, she's absolutely cute as hell, is a great pet parent, and she does the cutest goddamn things all the time. I'm absolutely smitten with her and get warm fuzzies all the time.

My issue is that our sex life is lacking to say the least. Usually it involves reciprocal oral with one to two positions and me finishing, I've tried to help her finish but often she dissuades me from focusing on that and just encourages me to do my thing.  I'm just... not into it. I often think of past sexual experiences or fantasize about other people while its happening. Maybe I need help. I dunno.

I feel less confident, I'm definitely not in the best shape to begin with, but I just don't feel that kind of machismo or mojo as I did when I was younger in the bedroom. She's also overweight and to be completely frank I just don't find her naked body attractive. I know, I probably sound like a huge asshole here. I realize I should get more fit if I wanted that to be my standard, but here we are. 

I love this person. I really do. Its just... when she ""initiates"" by lightly rubbing my thigh and some of my privates area, I feel absolutely nothing. I've tried to talk to her about this, telling her that I really need her to GO FOR IT if she's in the mood.

I'm probably just a huge jerk and expect that response in the comments, I just really wanted to get this off my chest.",z222td,0,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z222td/im_not_sure_im_sexually_attracted_to_my_partner/,relationships
257,I have issues with my friend’s lack of out-of-school communication with me but don’t know how to tell him without seeming clingy or weird,"I (16f) and my friend (16m) have known each other since the start of the school year, and I’ve had a huge crush on him since we met, but I always feel like there isn’t any way he could feel the same towards me. I have a severe fear of abandonment due to my father (who left my mom and i when i was only two years old) and tend to get really clingy because of it. My friend, however, has a habit of leaving people on read a lot. He talks to me an alright amount in person, but I feel like I’m just annoying him every time i try to text him or something. 

Even if I didn’t like him, I enjoy his company and he’s fun to be around. He has a lot of friends and I get that we aren’t exactly besties, but sometimes the way he never responds to my texts makes me feel really hurt, especially if I ask him a question and it feels like he just ignores me. I don’t know if he finds me annoying or something (he’s said he doesn’t, but i don’t completely believe that) but I do get really hurt or annoyed by his behavior a lot of the time. I want to tell him all this, but I’m scared he’s just going to ignore me or think that I’m being weird and too overbearing. 

It feels like we aren’t as close as we were just a month ago and I don’t know what’s going on. I have told him that I have issues with abandonment but nothings changed. I really like him and he’s a great friend, this is the only thing I can’t stand about him, and it feels like he cares about me a lot less than he does other people. What do I do?

(Edit for rephrasing) I realize now that it is unfair for me to assume he wants to talk to me all the time, and I in no way made this post to insinuate that he’s at fault here. I’m mostly asking if I SHOULD tell him how I feel and, if not, how I can get over that feeling of loneliness I get when I’m not talking to people. (and, for some people who say I should ask him out, i honestly don’t think of that as an option, considering he’s way out of my league and i’m an ugly girl lol)

TL;DR : My friend hardly ever talks to me outside of school and always leaves me on read. I have issues with abandonment and his behavior really hurts me sometimes. Am I overreacting? If so, how can I pull away without feeling lonely?",z222fo,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z222fo/i_have_issues_with_my_friends_lack_of_outofschool/,relationships
258,Need help!,"TL;DR: My wife wants to add her best friend in the bedroom. But I get hot/cold signals from all parties about it. 


So to start my wife(26F) and I(29M)have been together for 6 years. We have been engaged for 5 and married for 1. When we first got together we had some issues with the others past and on 1 occasion where she said she wanted to be DP’d by myself and another guy(never said who). She had snapchats of dudes di**s saved and I had nud*s saved from other girls in the past. We both wiped everything we had along those lines after having a discussion and we have been good since this discussion. She would NEVER let me look at other women, make comments, etc. She was very adamant she was to be the only woman I was attracted to. But within the last few years this has started to change and has me curious. 


As of the last 4 years my wife has really started to portray attraction to her best friend(27F). She became friends with the person at work and has slowly became her best friend out of all of them. Everything was fine for the first 2 years no issues seemed like a normal friendship. As of the last 2 years of their friendship my wife has thrown out on SEVERAL occasions that she is attracted to her friend. At first I tried not to agree as our past would indicate that I should state I am not attracted to her friend as well (but deep down my feelings are that her friend is very attractive in all aspects). But after a few of these comments I started to agree with her during these conversations.I believed she would have been upset by me agreeing but it seemed to make her more interested in the idea of her/us hooking up with her friend. So we have been casually joking around about this for sometime just between her and I. Saying it would be hot to watch her and her friend go at it and her saying how it would be to watch me with her friend. So I have continued to entertain the idea. They do talk to each other about s**ual stuff such as mastu***ting, toy play, the kind of s*x my wife and I have, kinks, etc. and I have even been part of some of these conversations while hanging out with them and it never seems very taboo to discuss topics like this with them. 


We have joked about being a “Thurple” on MANY occasions some of which even included all 3 of us talking about it. On one occasion I ask my wife how her friend felt about me and the exact statement was “You’re like a Ken doll to her, no se**al attraction at all.” So hearing this really took my self confidence down several pegs (struggled with self confidence and rejection my whole life) so after hearing this I started to wonder if her friend is not sexually attracted to me(at least what I have heard) then why would my wife continue to bring this topic up? 


Fast forward to this past weekend, we were hosting a get together at our place with a fire. All throughout the night my wife and her friend were joking about us being a thruple. Such as her friend referring to me as “honey, babe, dear.” Like if I went to get her a beer or something. During this event said friend falls into the fire, luckily I was able to lift her right out of the fire and pat the flames off of her. After we made sure she was safe we went into our house to get some burn cream and determine if an ER visit was needed (I have 2 years of RN/EMT training just wasn’t the right career path for me). All 3 of us were in our bedroom for this (Me, Wife, Best Friend) I had her friend take her pants off so I could see the burn. Once I determined the burn was not bad and just needed some burn cream, I asked for consent (4 times) to put the cream on and she allowed me to and then held out her finger for more cream. I gave her some to apply as she was applying the cream she pulled her a** apart (for reasons unknown to me) I got to see a little more than I guess I should have. We all joked about me seeing her half naked, she fell into the fire, and that I was able to save her with little to no burns. No one seemed to have any issues with anything that night.


Fast forward to yesterday my wife and said friend were talking about her(friends) gyno visit that happened yesterday. I tried to jump in the conversation to ask if the gyno checked the burns (just to be sure and have a professional look) I was IMMEDIATELY told to be quite and that I was not part of this conversation. So I left it at that. 



I guess my question after all of this is; How do I approach this situation? I love my wife and I would be open to adding her friend to our sex life but I don’t want to jeopardize our relationship or their friendship. But I keep getting mixed signals from everyone. I just have no idea how to handle this. Everyone I have asked so far just keeps telling me to not be a bi**h and just let it happen or make it happen.",z21uwh,1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z21uwh/need_help/,relationships
259,"Please someone help me with this pain that I feel, my tears flow every day now","I met a girl back in June, everything was wonderful, I could not belive how lucky I was. I have never felt so happy and comfortable with someone. We were not a couple but essentially acted like it. I would say friends with benefits, never was official. I seriously grew to care for her ALOT. Fast forward and I discovered that she has a serious temper after helping her find an apartment. She is so impatient even with the application, things went downhill fast. She blames me for not checking every single detail of the apartment e.g. neighbors, noise, etc. We had an argument and got past that, then she did not like something else and we started fighting about it. She is now angry at me for what I feel are things under her responsibility to check. She gets so mad that she tells me to stay away sometimes but this time she seems serious. Despite her recent attitude towards me I am worried sick about her, I care about her so much that I have to know that she will ok. The thought of never seeing her again is tearing me up, I have never shed a single tear for a girl in my 32 years (she is 36). I just want to know if this will get better, how do I let her go? How do I stop this pain? In my heart I know it will never work, I understand so many things now. Please if you had to forget or leave someone you deeply cared about and were able to overcome please tell me how or how long. My eyes water easily at certain music or things that remind me of her. I honestly hope that I am just overreacting and being weak or stupid or something because this is so difficult.

260,"It's not the right place or time, is she worth keeping?","Basic info- Me (M 17), Her -- let's call her J (F 17). 

Tl;Dr -- One day at my gym, J hits on me and asks for my #, later over text she admits her feelings that she's into me. I'm about to go to college in fall 23, J is a junior in HS, we're both restricted on travel since neither of us have a license. And I will turn 18 in Dec and get my license in Jan. She's turned 17 this Sept, so I'll be dating a minor a month from now. We aren't planning on visiting the same college. Should I get to know her better over a date, or would it be better to talk to her and break it off?

 
Super short tl;Dr -- might be the right person, but wrong place and wrong time. 


I'm a HS grad who took a gap year and is attending RU in fall '23. I just moved to NJ a few months back, while at my gym, J comes up to me with a cute corny pickup line and I give her my #. This told me that J already has an interest in me, and through further texting she admitted some feelings to me. 
J is also 17, she is currently a JUNIOR in HS though. She plans to attend a program specific school in NY. 
Neither of us have a license yet with us both having permits, I will get mine in January, but I'm turning 18 before then. 
So currently, we barely know each other, I'm going to uni real soon, we can't really ""hang out"" as often because of how restricted travel is (we live like 20m away but who's walking that distance) .
J still seems like a really cool person, I adore her personality, but parts of it remind me of my ex. Where my ex was childish almost, J is more grown and mature. But she's still a high schooler, while I'm about to go into college.. 
I haven't gotten much time with J which is why I would've liked a first date so I could gauge her better, I could see the chemistry there but I don't think it's the right time or place.

261,I (20F) feel like I'm being treated like a therapist by a family friend (17F),"Okay so for a bit of context my godmother's daughter (let's call her Laura) is having a rough time. She recently lost her dad 3 weeks ago from a sudden heart attack even though he was perfectly healthy. She's also failing school and hasn't applied to any colleges because her test scores and grades are so bad. She is planning on taking a gap year however to figure things out and I'm very happy for her about that.

She's also had a lot of friendship drama where these girls on the Lacrosse team are bullying her and you can tell she's quite isolated and has very few friends. Her relationship with her mom is severely strained. Her mom basically doesn't really trust her with certain things and her track record of trying to make improvements like getting her grades back up aren't helping either. She mentioned how she's not allowed to be out by herself and that her younger sister (16F) has to be with her to monitor her if she wants to go outside.

She's also having trouble sleeping and taking a concerning amount of benadryl regularly. She even admitted to me that she OD-ed on it one time but she said she was ""fine lol. nothing bad happened"". She also has suicidal thoughts and constantly tells me how she doesn't think she'll make it past the age of 20 and that ""what's the point in trying if I'm going to die anyway lmao"" or ""The Taylor Swift Tickets got sold out and that was my only reason to keep going"". She is severely depressed and lacks the motivation to get out of bed.

My mom has spoken to my godmother to get her POV of the situation and it seems like my godmother has good intentions and wants to help her daughter (after all she's a nice lady who really wants Laura to get better and enjoy her life).

However Laura is still a teenager. She's still immature and not really understanding of other people's perspectives or being sensitive about other people. So she doesn't fully comprehend her mom's POV which is understandable; all teenagers feel that way at some point in their lives.

She also told me how one of her former coworker/friends reported her and she got 5150-d. It was a very traumatic experience for her and she's terrified of going to hospitals now. She's obviously using humor as a coping mechanism to deal with all of the baggage and I'm really worried for her because I feel like she thinks I'm the only one she can trust because I would never report anyone like that (I have the personal belief that having the police drag you away is not going to help anyone involved).

I don't necessarily consider Laura a friend but I think she considers me to be one of the few she has. She's not quite a younger sister but that's closer to what I would classify her as.

I do genuinely care about her safety and well being but all of these conversations have been taking a huge toll on me. I'm doing my best to be an active listener and be someone who's there without any judgement. I'm also being very careful on how I respond because I'm obviously not a trained professional so I'm not spouting out any advice in the case that it might be harmful.

I have brought up having her go see a professional therapist multiple times but she keeps on saying how she failed out of group therapy, how her mom doesn't believe in therapy, how expensive it is because she's not so sure how her dad's life insurance is being managed, and how even though her mom is looking for a therapist she could see 1:1 that her mom is going to force her to sign a form that would basically remove any confidentiality between Laura and the therapist. The therapist would have to report everything she says back to her mother.

I asked her why her mother is doing this and Laura thinks it's because her mom doesn't want her to get 5150-d again. I also asked my mom on her input and she said it's because Laura's mom probably wants Laura to get better asap and that Laura's mom feels hurt that Laura won't open up about her problems to her.

Because of this, Laura doesn't feel safe talking freely to any therapist because she knows that her mom will know everything that she said in a session. She also mentioned how she has gotten better at lying to her psychiatrist. However, she does turn 18 soon so I believe she does have her own autonomy over patient confidentiality once that happens. I did mention this to her but she didn't really give any response back on this comment?

I'm in college finishing up my degree in Software Engineering and to no one's surprise this shit is really hard. I have a part time internship I'm doing alongside that and I'm trying to make sleep and health a priority as well. And no one but my mom knows but I have bulimia and it's a living hell. I'm looking for a ED Specialist who I can see around my school because I want to get better and not cry myself to sleep whenever I did or didn't eat something or whether or not I was able to get everything back up.

Obviously I know I should prioritize my mental health and that I need to draw a line. But I'm not so sure how to go about that? Because I still feel really guilty that all I'm doing is letting her rant in a safe space, not even giving out advice, and I'm still exhausted? I feel like I shouldn't be allowed to be tired or sick of dealing with her problems because all I'm doing is just listening.

Also I'm worried that if I withdraw just suddenly she'll feel like she'll have no one left to support her and that she might do something that will put herself in danger.

Please I'm really scared and I don't know what to do. I already talked about this a bit with my mom but I would like some other input as well.

**tldr:** My family friend is using me as their therapist because they are concerned over patient confidentiality and I'm really tired and scared.",z21krm,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z21krm/i_20f_feel_like_im_being_treated_like_a_therapist/,relationships

263,My (22F) boyfriend (22M) refuses to take elevators. I'm afraid he might get hurt. How do I talk to him about it without sounding childish?,"Hi. I don't know if this belongs here. From the title this probably sounds silly, but I'm not good at these kinds of conversations and could use some advice.

Long story short, unless he has no other option, my boyfriend of 2 years - we'll call him James - refuses to take elevators. He doesn't seem scared of them, really. He's been perfectly calm during the few times we've ridden on one together. But when I've asked him about it in the past, he always said the same thing: that dying in an elevator accident is the ""lamest way to go."" He played it as kind of a joke, yet I got the sense that he'd made up his mind about it, if that makes any sense.

At first I thought it was just an idiosyncrasy - he's kind of a goofy dude, which is something I really love about him. And it wasn't a concern when we first started dating, since we lived on the second floor of the co-ed dorm. In fact, most of the students on our floor took the stairs out of courtesy to people on higher floors, myself included. However, our apartment now is on the top floor of a fairly tall building. Even if we're bringing groceries up, he'll ""race"" me to the top so he can meet me at the elevator and take my bags for me. Admittedly, the elevators in our building are quite slow. But unless a lot of people are trying to use them at once - which rarely happens - there's not a significant time difference between them and the stairs.

The real problem is, while he's in very good shape, James has chronically low blood pressure due to a medication he's on. Sometimes when we're hiking steep trails, he'll stumble out of nowhere and have to sit or lean against something until he's no longer lightheaded. If he stands up too suddenly, he might black out for a few seconds. He describes it as a sudden dizziness, combined with loss of vision. So I'm really worried that he might get dizzy and trip, or even fall down the stairs. The steps also have a small tread, which isn't great for someone who wears a men's 13-13.5.

I've talked to his mother about the elevator thing. She remembers he started avoiding them early in high school, and that he gave her the exact same reason he gives me. As far as she knows, he doesn't have any elevator-related trauma, nor does anyone else in the family. I want to discuss it with him, but I feel silly because I know it's such a minor thing. We have a really good relationship. In the time we've been together, he's never made me feel unreasonable or anything like that - he always takes my worries seriously, even if I know they're stupid. But I've had bad experiences with past boyfriends. I'm afraid that if I push too far, James might start to think that I'm not worth the hassle.

Which is why I've never approached him about this issue, and why I've done my best to hide my concern. I know the stairs aren't as steep or long as the trails we usually go on. He's also never mentioned having trouble on the stairs before.  I'm not good at being objective about things I'm worried over, so I can't be sure if the risk of him getting hurt is actually significant or if I'm just blowing it out of proportion. Either way, I still want to ask him about it, maybe try to convince him that it's not worth potentially hurting himself.

Can anyone recommend a mature, convincing way of expressing my concerns so that I don't sound unreasonable?  Is it something that's even worth worrying about?

TL;DR:  BF refuses to use elevators and always takes the stairs up to our top floor apartment.  I'm afraid his low BP may cause him to get hurt.  I don't know if I'm overreacting or not. I need advice on whether/how I should raise the issue.",z214ow,0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z214ow/my_22f_boyfriend_22m_refuses_to_take_elevators_im/,relationships

She was kicked out of her downtown storefront building about a year and a half ago, and now has a large, three-story building in a bad, low-traffic suburban area off of a three-way intersection that she also lives in because she lost the two-story house she had been rented for 7 years.

She is clearly depressed. She is completely alone with her dog. She (49) is now dating a 26-year-old Iranian military guy that she met while on a trip to Turkey.

Overall she is a friendly woman and she cares about me, but she treated me like absolute crap as a child (I had no education, was raised in Scientology, and she blamed me and my younger brother for her problems often). Also, due to Scientology (which is extremely expensive), my mom refuses any other form of mental health assistance as it is demonized in Scientology.

265,How do I tell my BF that I don't want to celebrate the holidays?,"Hello everyone!

I am stuck in a rut with the upcoming holiday celebrations. I haven't been celebrating Christmas or NYE in the last several years, because I don't really get the hype and these holidays IMO gotten same-ish and repetitive over time. My best friend, on the other hand, would want to go out somewhere this year and I am not sure how to tell her that it is not really my thing. 

Like, sure I could suffer through going out somewhere, but I am pretty sure it would be too obvious that I'm counting the time until I can finally go home. This whole year has been one big crisis for me so I would want to have some peace for once.

At the same time, I feel guilty over declining her invitation, because she doesn't really have any other friends to celebrate with besides her family. 

Just to clarify, we haven't been planning anything, so it's not like I'm trying to slip out of some promises given earlier. 

I understand this info might not be much, but I wonder what you would do if you were stuck in this rather classic extrovert vs introvert clash of interests. If that even matters we are both in our mid-20s.

honestly that didn’t make me feel better, he raises his voice and shouts when we get into EVERY argument, and we’ve been having a few the past month. the fights are draining. 

he try’s to apologize again and i turn away in silence just to let it process. few moments pass and he says i’m trying to start something and i never let him talk. thus the fighting happens again and i tell him multiple times i wasn’t trying to start a fight again, and he asks why i started a fight earlier and basically starts psychoanalyzing how i’ve been behaving and why i’ve been having issues with him. i told him i was upset that he yelled and i wish he’d stop during arguments and being late for errands i needed to do (i was worried we weren’t gonna have enough time) then he goes down a list of things i do that bother him and how i have no empathy or consideration for what he’s dealing with right now. he tells me clearly the time of the errands didn’t matter since i went with him anyways and i just lose it. i scream and cry that it was for safety reasons and my time matters too. he threatens to call the cops  (he says this no matter if i calm or screaming my head off) and i calm down but i tell him i didn’t want this to happen! he’s the one that said i was trying to start something, he instigated the fight more when i brought up a concern. he loses it and screams that he has work to do and im ruining his life. at that moment i stop and just cry. he keeps talking but i stop hearing anything else. once he’s done, i get up and grab anything and everything that is mine in that apartment. he follows me but doesn’t say a word. 

i get home and he calls me to let him know when i’m home. but i don’t, cause i’m just drained and so upset with what he said. i haven’t talked to him in two days. i don’t think i can reach out (i always do when we fight, he never does) and i don’t think he will. i don’t think he thinks he did anything wrong or maybe the relationship should be over.

267,is our relationship weirdly laidback? (23m) (21f),"I'm 23, her 21. We're long distance.

Me and my girlfriend have been with each other for 8 months. I'm comfortable, I'm happy, and as far as I'm aware so is she.

However, our relationship is definitely laidback, and feels more friendly some times. She'll say she misses me every week or two, that she loves me once or twice a week, but aside from that our interactions aren't very affectionate. We largely just hang out in calls playing video games and talking about stuff in general - but rarely anything flirty or affectionate.

Sexting? Just doesn't happen. It did happen before we met in person whenever I initiated it, and when I did initiate she said it was hot and enjoyed it, but she never initiates herself, so I pulled back from it too.

Every so often mostly on our monthly anniversaries she'll say something very cute about me, and when it seemed in doubt that we'd be able to meet the other month she did then say she felt like crying and that it's hard without me around. But that was mostly it.

In person this girl says she loves me daily, is physically and verbally affectionate and everything feels right. But the fact we're so laidback and friendly when we're apart does make me worry her feelings will fizzle out. Is this just overly worrying?

269,Exes as best friends: stupid to think that we might be the exception to the rule?,"tl;dr: we broke up due to lack of chemistry and ex thinks that the resulting relationship dynamic is appropriate and healthy as-is just because it's nonsexual. I would like some help understanding what to change and whether friendship is even a good idea. 

My (27F) boyfriend (27M) and I broke up last week after a three-month transition into an emotionally intimate but platonic relationship. The nearly 2-year relationship lacked chemistry from the start, which was always at odds with the love we developed for one another. It was a feeling of finally seeing and being seen by another person. We leaned fully into developing our emotional connection, even though our sex life struggled along and finally died out. We really were each other's person and the breakup wasn't personal. I don't really understand what ""lacking chemistry"" meant for us - we tried to understand it and work on it throughout the relationship, but there was something stubborn and inherent about it. 

I'm not even angry at him for breaking my heart. What broke my heart the most was seeing the pain in his eyes when he suggested we pull the plug for good, since I know how important our friendship is to both of us. That's why it lasted as long as it did. I'm not angry that he couldn't ""see my worth,"" because he did. I don't regret the relationship because we shared a special bond that also made sense: we bantered like same-sex friends, were colleagues at work, introduced each other to new interests, and brought out the best in one another. He has a more romanticized vision of what our friendship could be: he suggested that our dynamic didn't even need to change much going forward. He also said that it could be better this way, having started as partners and ended as friends, because friendship is more likely to last forever. He thinks we could be a ""Jerry Seinfeld & Elaine.""

I don't know what to make of this. What he is basically suggesting is that the feelings we have for one another are appropriate and healthy to maintain. I am in the process of thinking about which aspects of our relationship are **not** appropriate or healthy to maintain so that I can set healthy boundaries.

Some expectations I thought of that are inappropriate:

* we no longer have a formal commitment to one another
* we cannot expect to remain the most important person to the other
* we cannot expect to feel constantly connected or close to the other (we need to individuate)

I would like some help thinking of other boundaries or behaviors to transition away from. I also would like to get some advice on what ""moving on"" looks like when you stay friends with someone. Should we not leap into friendship right away? Should we only doing things in groups for a few months?

270,My mom (64F) hasn't comforted me (23F) over my dad dying.,"Let me start by saying my mom is autistic. She doesn't know how to comfort someone and it was really hard growing up with a mom that I thought didn't care to be close with me. Now that I'm older I understand a little more about how her brain works. That doesn't make it easier though. My dad died this year and ever since she has told me every single day ""I don't think I'm going to make it"" and other phrases that she just hangs onto and keeps repeating. 

The other night I tried telling her calmly that she hasn't even asked me once how I'm doing since my dad died, but I'm expected to comfort her daily and it's starting to really get to me. She just got defensive and said ""it's hard to focus on anyone else because this is happening to me."" then we stopped the conversation.

I feel like I'm checking out on my mom's feelings and becoming a little annoyed at her honestly. It's not her fault.

I need guidance on how to navigate this please. Can anyone else relate?

271,I (35M) think I need to breakup with my girlfriend (39F),"Yes I know I don't have any karma and its a new account, I made a throwaway account specifically so I could post this.

I (35M) have been with my girlfriend(39F) for just over a year. Things were very good early on but have been sliding the last 2 months. She's very sweet, and very supportive, as I am with her. Often times though when she is stressed or frustrated with something such as work, family, friends, she has a tendency to take the frustration out on me. Not in a physical way mind you, but she vents at me, and not to me. Gets cranky and flustered at me. I have addressed it but as soon as I do, its like getting punched and then her saying I'm sorry.

Another thing that struck a nerve with me was when I talked to her mother on the phone about a week ago. I had mentioned I was concerned about my girlfriends mental health and asked if she had talked ever talked to a professional. Her mother told me she had when ""she was going through her affair"". Now, I was told by my girlfriend that her ex husband was having an affair, and started talking to another guy out of spite. But if she was having the affair first, that's a whole different story.

The big problem came last week, and I have not addressed it yet, but intend to. Her and I drove to pick my mom up at the airport, and while we were driving back to our place, a message popped up on her screen in my car from the name ""James"". My eyes instantly darted off the road and to her phone that was in her lap, and the message said ""So are we still on for drinks sometime?"" I tried not to make it obvious I had seen the message on her phone, so I asked her ""who's James?"" She said ""that's my gay best friend"". She has mentioned one of her friends is gay, but I have yet to meet him in person. Regardless of whether he is gay or not, the fact that she's been planning to go out for drinks with someone of the opposite sex and not telling me really rubs me the wrong way. I keep asking myself how she would feel if I had a female friend who wanted to go for drinks without me telling her and even if they were gay, she would be pissed. The orientation doesn't matter. I feel she has been hiding this from me and its seriously not okay.

I don't usually cry when I drink, this is the first time it has happened when drinking with my boyfriend. We have known each other for over a year and are in a relationship since May this year. We mixed a bunch of shots, drank about 1,5 bottle worth of alcohol with his roommate. Luckily the roommate was already gone when I broke down. (I cried because I suddenly started thinking about death lol Maybe it's also worth mentioning that my period is in 2 days so that must have affected my emotions.) 

My boyfriend was very sweet about it but I feel embarrassed, I'm also overly-conscious about my relationship because this is the first time when I feel honest love and attachment for someone as I have a fearful-avoidant attachment style and being open about my emotions is scary. He makes me feel like I can really be myself and always assures me that he accepts me completely. However I am sometimes worried exactly for this reason. He is so good to me but what if I will be too much for him to handle?

We always had a very honest and open relationship so even in the start I asked him about this and he said that he wants to date and seem more or less sure about it.
He is the only person I am talking to because of many years with depression and I relayed on him a lot, I think it finally got to him how annoying I am and I can't blame him at all.
I have a very important exam soon and I freaked out, I got very stressed and when I am stressed I usually will tell things that I am trying to hide and I told my bf how I feel about him not liking me which started to bother me again after we didnt meet for the last month (he is busy with university, he wanted to meet but he is basically dying there).
After I told him how I feel he stopped saying he loves me (like before we go to sleep or just normally), I think something clicked in his mind and he wants to talk this Friday.

I have been having some panic attacks because I know what is coming, I am very aware of my fragile mental state and I am scared of what is coming. I am taking a lot of sleeping pills and trying to study all the time to not think about it but I just can't, I have no one to ask for advice so I will ask here a few questions.

276,Got upset with my(f 24) boyfriend(m 23) and behaved in an inappropriately rude way at an office party. How do I make it up to him?,"

For some context on our relationship, the person I am referring to here is not exactly my boyfriend, we have been bffs since college and ended up getting physical. I have always had feelings for him and he knows it (he initially admitted to having feelings for me too but later one day he said he doesn’t feel the same way and he was confused initially). We’ve been together since last 4 years and never dated or went out with anyone else throughout, and we do everything together that a couple would. He remained this committed because he truly cares about me and doesn’t want to hurt me, but this has still made me feel pretty insecure because we arent in a relationship and he’s free to see anyone else the day he wishes. I don’t like being in this situation either but I’m way too hopelessly in love with him to let him go (not that I’m anyway holding him back, it’s up to him). All I expect from him is that he tells me upfront the day he thinks he’d like to see anyone else and ends things with me and not just keep me hanging.

We are now working at the same law firm (joined right after graduation 5 months back), just different teams (practice areas) in offices across the city, so we often see each other if working on same matters. Ppl at office think of us as just good friends.

We recently went for an annual office retreat which is basically a weekend long vacation, with various parties/events and involves loads of drinking. At one such party we were both super sloshed while dancing with a bunch of others from our office, most of them were from his team and a couple others.

Now, there comes a girl (from his team) and hugs him while dancing and continues to dance with him and hugs again, and he pushes me aside while making space for her. I remained calm initially and overlooked but she went on dancing with him like that (she danced with others too but didn’t exactly hug anyone) and he doesn’t resist at all, to which I eventually made a super pissed face and yelled “f*** **f” and left. Everyone saw that, but since they were all sloshed and the music was too loud, they just carried on dancing.

He later came up to me and asked why I’m so upset but I just ignored him and walked away; even while getting dinner he put his arms around my shoulders asking what’s wrong and I just aggressively put his hands away and again everyone saw that. On our way back (we had a bus back to our hotel), I didn’t speak to him and he constantly kept asking and said that he’s sorry if he did anything to upset me but I just cried.

Later in the night, since he kept asking, I finally told him what’s wrong to which he said he’s sorry and that she’s just a senior and it didn’t mean anything it was just a dance and I’m overreacting. He is now upset that I created a scene in front of everyone from his office and that they think I yelled at him because he did something inappropriate with me on the dance floor and while getting dinner, which is not wrong because I did hear ppl talk about it with completely different assumptions about what happened.

I do think that I overreacted and could’ve talked about it in a private space. What should I do?

277,My (23) Bf (22) lied about a WeChat feature and I'm concerned," 

Hey hey! I'll try to explain this as much as I can bc at this point I don't know what to think.

I recently got into a relationship with my current Bf, first relationship I've ever been in. I have had crushes and talking stages, but nothing serious. I love my Bf to bits, he's kind, thoughtful, we spend a lot of fun time together and it's early, but I think I can see a future with him.

I think the only issue in our relationship is his ex. They started dating when he was 16 and she was 25 (whole other level of problematic in itself, absolutely not on his end but on hers) and dated for a while, until they broke it off amicably when they both left to work in different countries. Based on what I've been told by him, he broke it off with her given the upcoming long term distance and differing future plans, that was his first and only relationship and he never considered her as a serious prospect, so his parents never knew (for context, we both come from cultures where parental approval is important in relationships and we're both living in a different country from our home country). He says that he loves me, that his parents know about me, that he doesn't have any lingering feelings for his ex and I am posted on all his social media.

Here's the kicker: I'm not sure if I believe all that. They got together when he was very young and she was much older, and I'm concerned what effect that can have on someone. Most recently, we were having a heart to heart about past history and I told him that all my former quasi-exes/failed talking stages are blocked (reason ranging from ""ended horribly"" to ""mildly annoyed""). I asked him whether that's the case for his ex too, and he confessed that it isn't. He asked if he wants me to delete his ex from his WeChat and I said that's his decision to make and absolutely none of my business. What he said next concerns me though: he said he can only delete her, as **blocking is not a feature on WeChat**. I don't know much about his culture or WeChat, but I know that's not true. He grew up using it and a quick google search (what I used) can reveal that it's entirely possible to block someone on that app, so he can't not know, right? Evidently, he lied. (Or the entirety of Google lied to me, idk)

Should I be concerned? Should I talk to him about this? How should I even bring up this conversation? Help an inexperienced girl with poor relational skills out :')

278,My relationship is turning into a situationship and I (21F) don’t know what I’m doing,"Long long story short, I (21F), and for good reasons, was going to break up with my boyfriend (21M). We both knew he wasn’t being a good partner to me. Not supporting me, unreasonable lashing out on me (it was 1-2 incidents of it but everything it got to me so bad), not inviting me to see his family, following random girls but I can’t follow random guys, it’s a lot. 

I guess you could say there was a last straw that broke the camel’s back because after that last straw, I called it quits. I told him I was done with this relationship, yada yada. This was a month ago. I want to empathize I know I’m not perfect, but I’m aware I deserve better in a relationship. 

He did a complete 180. He started putting in more effort, inviting me to family gatherings, insisting on going out, being there for me more, etc. In the beginning I was pissed off by this sudden effort because I felt like he only started this NOW because I was done. But as the month went by, the anger started to subside, and it’s left me confused. 

I’m confused because I do love him, but now I don’t think a relationship is what I want right now. I’m super young, but I’m scared it’s too late for me to make friends. 

I feel like this is the time where I should be selfish with my time and self. I want to work on my physical health and appearance, jump into therapy, see why my eyes wander towards a few guys (basically saying I may be interested in exploring), but more than anything I really need to make friends. 

So that’s where I’m at right now. And I don’t know what to do because I’m scared to be alone (although the relationship felt mostly lonely), I miss having friends, I’m interested in exploring, but I love my current boyfriend, I just don’t know what I’m doing. Any advice? Is it too late for me to make friends? I had some hope when a few people randomly included me in their conversation at college. I think it would help if I put myself out there more on campus

279,Relationship issue,"my bf (30/m) texted me (27/f) on Friday @ around 8pm to tell me he was going out. When I asked where to, he said to hang out with his cousin. We texted a little, even talked on the phone (and had a really sweet convo) as he made his way there. he was there until about 10pm. After that, I didn’t hear from him which was fine because I was letting him have his time out. But at 12:15am I called (2x , and text once saying “ are you okay?”) … he eventually calls at 1am and I ask where he was. He said “ out with friends”.. when I asked what friends, he got mad and said he “doesn’t have to answer to me, he’s not a little kid.” I asked him when did he see my “ are you okay” text and he asked why I’m asking if he’s okay and that he saw it “when I sent it” .. It’s now Tuesday and he still refuses to tell me who he was with. 

He thinks idk, but I found out he went to the bar with a group of older women (about 4) that he used to work with and to out to bars with in the past. There was some inappropriate behavior with one of these women when he worked there, but because she had a falling out with the coworkers and was fired, I don’t believe she was there. The reason he left that job was because he was apologetic that he hurt me by engaging in poor behavior with the one who eventually got fired and decided to leave to make me feel more secure (it’s been about two years since this happened and I haven’t felt the need to question him ever since. He’s been really good to me) 

Because of the bad history with that group, I think he opted not to tell me he was going with them out of fear I’d disapprove. I also know that he knew of these plans when we spoke earlier in the night, but didn’t tell me. I feel silly writing this, because I know what I need to do and that’s leave. I feel so betrayed that he crossed a boundary and doesn’t care to tell me. I asked him again on monday who he went with and he said he “ doesn’t care and is not having this conversation.” With the history of these women, who are all probably about 40y/o, it’s so inappropriate to me for him to have gone out with them. It’s like backtracking for our relationship. And the fact that it was so calculated in him NOT telling me makes me feel more hurt. We haven’t spoken to each other since Friday and we’re both giving the silent treatment ( WHY HE IS?? idk )
we live together and our lease ends in September, which is making this all much harder. Thoughts?

Probably about the 3rd day I was getting to know him, I found out he had a “girl best friend”. Let’s call her “Sarah”. 

That’s fine with me and all but the only thing is, I found out that he actually does stuff with her (kiss, have sex, hold hands). I asked him once if he would kiss or do anything with a girl he liked and he said no- out of respect for Sarah. SMH?? He kept telling me they’re just best friends who do stuff together and that they weren’t in a relationship. I took his word for it because from the start, he’s always been very transparent with me. On the other hand her- she is practically in love with this guy. She’s fully dependent on him for her happiness too. I told Steve that I respect whatever he and Sarah have going on and he kept reassuring me there isn’t anything going on but he was understanding if I wanted to stop talking to him because of the situation. I told him no, I’m not bothered because I actually started to really like him.  

One day… Steve and I were talking and he told me Sarah found messages from him and i and got so upset she told him he doesn’t want to talk to him for a bit. Which is weird right? Considering they aren’t in a relationship or anything. I understand a little tho just because he was fully transparent with me but not with her. I just assumed she was in love with him and he wasn’t. Me and Steve were hanging out the other day and Sarah kept blowing his phone up at least 50 times over and over again. As I was being dropped off to my car, Steve said he has a huge feeling Sarah is waiting at his house. Sure enough she was and I was pretty much held hostage in Steve’s car, he was trying to get away from me! Like a psycho maniac, she kept honking, following and chasing us down the road. I kept asking to get dropped off to my car but apparently that wasn’t an option. Finally, Steve got his mom to call Sarah to tell her to go home and she did. 
The next morning apparently Sarah messaged Steve apologizing for acting that way and that it wouldn’t happen again….

That same night Steve and I went to get food and after the night was over I went to sleep and woke up the next morning to Steve sending me a SCREENSHOT of this Instagram DM message from MY account saying “he is all mine now, move on you’re pathetic”. He was saying Sarah got these messages from my account. I told him I promise i have no idea how these messages were sent from my account considering I never sent them nor would I ever speak like that to anyone regardless of the situation! He continued to accuse me and tell me he doesn’t believe me because the screenshot “doesn’t lie?”. 
It was clearly a fake DM and if he were to look closely he would’ve been able to see how  crooked and blurry the whole entire DM looked, it jus looked sketch. 

He told me “I think this is a good reason to just stop talking now”. I told him I respected his decision but I needed him to know I didn’t send those messages. Regardless if he believed me or not but what really hurt is how fast he switched up like that. Going based off an accusation and wouldn’t even give me the opportunity to speak. Since then we haven’t talked, that was about 4 days ago. I saw him at the office here and there but we don’t make eye contact. Today was the first time we made eye contact but I’m pretty sure he’s just over me at this point- which makes me really sad. I couldn’t believe he just flipped so quickly. Over something that wasn’t true. It’s clear as day that his crazy psycho best friend or whatever she is, somehow faked those messages. Steve said there’s no way she knew how to do that considering she’s not very “tech savvy”.  I almost find him an absolute idiot at this point. If he doesn’t realize his crazy friend going thru his phone, blowing his phone up, pulling up to his house randomly, or stalking him is not normal? Good luck to him honestly. 

I hope he finds the truth out one day.. I miss him but I know I need to get over him and I’m just delusional. He was a cool person and we really connected but I guess that fairytale dream is over now.

282,"My (36M) girlfriend (35F) met someone at a club 4 months ago and emotionally cheated on me while we had big issues in our relationship, then dumped me shortly after and dated him, then we got back together and had a wonderful time for 4 months until I found out.","Me (36M) and my girlfriend (35F) has been together for 9 months.

After the initial honey period, it started to get a little bumpy, we were broken up for a few weeks after 2 months, when got together again. The emotional connection and intimacy were and is great. She is a caring, beautiful, feminine, kind woman. I also do my best to be the best man for her. We both admit that we have a great chemistry when being together, one of the rare instances we both had in a long time.

At the same time, we had some issues, like differences in our extraversion, me being more on the introverted side. Also, had some incompatibility with her family, but step by step it seems they have accepted me and I managed to start some good relationships with her folks. Also, she is that kind of outgoing and very extraverted woman with a huge social circle, lots of best guy friends and spontaneous and, in my opinion, over the top behavior. For example she thinks it is Ok to go out with another guy on a clubbing spree and get home drunk at 5AM. I am always invited, but when I can’t come for some reason, I expect her to stay with me and set up a party next time. This is coming probably partly from my insecurities and from my more right leaning upbringing and values. We struggled with boundaries a lot at first, I was the one who tried to set them up and she was reluctant to accept.

We had an additional couple short term break-ups, not longer than a few days, where she would pack her stuff and leave my house. We usually start messaging each other soon after, get back, have great sex and everything seems to go back to normal.

For around 3-4 months now, it seemed we managed to overcome our differences and had no falling-outs whatsoever. Everything was super great. I felt secure, happy, she felt she was allowed to do whatever she wants, even alone or with her girlfriends, unless it involves some of her guy friends. We negotiated and agreed on our boundaries. It looked like we managed to build a strong bond and overcome the issues we had, we started to plan our future.

Until yesterday. I saw a message pop-up on her phone, some guy was texting he missed her. I asked who he was and she was reluctant to say anything at first. After some time she disclosed that around 4 months ago, when we were kind of broken-up and got back together in 5 days, she went on a date with this guy.

This kind of wouldn’t be that big of a deal for me, we were technically broken-up. The issue is, she met this guy around a week ago before they actually dated. At that time, we were on good terms, she was living at my place and honestly, I did not notice anything unusual in her behavior. She went on a girls night out with her girlfriend on another city and met 2 guys, one of them was the one who texted her yesterday. She said since we were on-and-off for quite some time, she felt insecure about our relationship and whether I am the man of her life she wants a family with.

To be honest, we did not specifically agree that we are officially a couple, change our FB status etc., due to the initial issues she even asked me for more time for her to think when I proposed to get official, but we both verbally agreed that we are in monogamic relationships, we lived together most of the time, we got to know each others family and friends.

So she met this guy at a club, she said he was so charming, funny, spontaneous and interesting. They partied all night, they went for a swim in the lake all four of them. She gave him her FB, he messaged her the next morning and she invited to join them again at a music festival. When she got back home, to my house, she wrote to him, that it would be good to meet him again and that she misses him already. She disclosed to him that she is in some kind of not-official relationship with me and she is lost as to what to do, because he is so amazing and her current relationship has issues. He tried to hit on her anyway.

A few days passes by and we split up again, initiated by her quite abruptly, for some silly reason I do not even remember. For 5 days, during which she went on a date with this guy. She said there was no sex, just a kiss. So, after 5 days I miss her, message her and she happily comes over as nothing ever happened. We had one additional 3 days split the next month, but it was the last one and we actually managed to overcome most of our issues. It was really great now for 4 months. We officially agreed we are a couple, we changed our FB status.

The issue is, she actively went into contact, flirting and activities with another guy on quite a romantic setting. She disclosed she is kind of taken, but did it anyway, as I waited for her at my home, were we lived, ate, watched Netflix and had lots of sex just a day or two before or after her travel. She was actively seeking or accepting his attention through messaging and calls for the next week and, in my opinion, she broke up with me to date him. **They had a date while we were broken up, but the romantic connection was set up during our relationship.** As I understand she did not like him after all, she said he seemed over-confident, a little fake and arrogant and had some misogynistic views about women. While she got back to me after a couple of days, he still tried to message her, (sometimes she was initiating with some simple messages like “How are you?”) but on a much smaller scale than before and at one point she said she is with me now and he should not expect anything from her. He still tried a few times after that, she replied, but with nothing more than a few cold words.

She seems to be or at least looks very troubled and says she loves me and sincerely wants to be with me and asks for forgiveness. She gave me all information on her phone or at least what was left undeleted, I know this is my speculation, but I feel insecure now. From what I saw, there are no evidence their romance got beyond the casual kiss she mentioned. I also saw lots of messages from other guys hitting, to which she casually replied that she is not interested. I also found she replied to her long-term ex around same time as she met the guy, they were together for 8 years (6 years ago and she cheated on him) they discussed some nostalgia and she wrote she dreamt about him and missed him. This also added to my insecurities that I am just a back-up plan for her and that she just uses me as a safe guy if something better won’t come up.

She is extra good to me now. She agreed to accept that she won’t be able to join any parties or events without me for quite some time to not fuel my insecurities and make us split up again. She accepted to remove the guys from her FB or block them if they try to hit on her. She agreed she should not have any contact with other guys, except colleagues or old friends and her communication style with others should not be so easy-going and always disclose her status as a woman already spoken for.

She did everything that I think should be done to try and repair our relationships and reclaim my trust. But, at least for now, I can’t stop thinking her emotionally cheating and flirting with some random dude she met at a club, despite that we had issues together. I feel betrayed and not respected, she accepts my feeling and says is willing to wait it out.

Should I try to wait it out or her accepting advances from another guy is too much to accept as appropriate behavior even if our relationship was semi-official and with issues?

TL;DR. Find out my (36M) girlfriend (35F) met someone at a club 4 months ago and emotionally cheated on me and never told me. We had a wonderful times since and I am lost whether accept her mistake as it is and continue the relationship or brake up as she can do it again.",z1tksk,0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z1tksk/my_36m_girlfriend_35f_met_someone_at_a_club_4/,relationships
283,I [25M] finally realized that I have strong feelings for my longtime friend [23F] who currently has a long distance boyfriend,"Really not sure what I want to get out of this, and it’s fine if I’m in the wrong, I get that, and this may be long and rambling. Me and the girl, we’ll call her Amy, have been friends and neighbors for over a decade. We both graduated college and have since moved home and been hanging out more as a result. She has been dating her boyfriend for around 6 months in a long distance relationship. Recently he was in town and she asked me to get dinner with him, as he really wanted to meet me. I agreed, and was fine about it until 24 hours before hand, where I genuinely got sick to my stomach. Ultimately got dinner with them, went home and realized that I have feelings for her. 

For context, she’s written me a letter before about how proud of me she was, I got an Instagram post from her for my birthday despite not having an Instagram, as well as her taking me out to dinner for my birthday. She also has never seemed too excited about her boyfriend, never gushes over him, just says things matter a factly about him(I realize this can be considered possibly misconstrued coming from me), and seems to be with him simply because he treats her decent after she had a rough relationship in college. 

The reason I never tried to make a move is because I’ve mistaken things with a friend before and got really hurt, as I read into things to much when they are not there. We confide with each other about most everything, and I finally realized that I like her more then a friend. I guess what I’m asking is am I wrong for this, and should I tell her how I feel about her? Mostly I’m just upset at myself that it took me so long to realize, and I’ve been feeling horrible about the situation for a while.

284,"My boyfriend (m30) is making comments about my (f25) clothes, eating habits, lifestyle choices etc.","My boyfriend of 4,5 years has begun repeatedly commenting on my eating habits, clothes and lifestyle choices etc. And it really annoys me.

I don't eat unhealthy, i cook for myself (and him) most days and doesn't eat much sweets and cake. But when i do, my boyfriend always comments that i shouldn't eat it, or makes me feel bad for doing it. Last time I was a bit hungover and ate 100g of crisps, which he didn't approve of.. and he doesn't even eat healthy himself. He would rather by takeout than make a meal for himself eg. 

I have had low energy the past couple of years due to stress at university with loads of exams. So i haven't been working out regularly, and only when i felt like I had time both physically and mentally. I bike to school every day, and walk a lot on my work, take walks, so i don't just sit at home. He works out several days a week, and he wishes that i do too. I'm just sick of him telling me to go to the gym all the time.. i want to do it on my own terms. 

And then he also comments on how i spend my time in the weekends. I like to meet up with friends and enjoy a few beers/go out/make a nice meal and drink a glass of wine etc. But he makes me feel bad about it. He says i should take better care of my self and live a more quiet life without going out so much. I just don't agree on that - i want to be able to see my friends! Of cause i prioritize him as well, but he works 2 hours away, and is not always home. So when he is he expects me to be home every time.

I'm sorry for the long post, but I guess i'm just lost. I don't know what to do, because i have told hom that this hurts me. That i don't feel accepted the way I am. But he doesn't seem to understand that.
I think i just need some clarity over the problem. Maybe he is just trying to help me get healthier, and maybe i should just be happy about it. I don't know.

Tldr; boyfriend makes comments about my lifestyle choices, and makes me feel bad. How should i react.",z1bbm1,13,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z1bbm1/my_boyfriend_m30_is_making_comments_about_my_f25/,relationships
285,My now fiance (33M) wants biological children but I (31F) don't want to be a biological mother,"We been dating for over for 4 years and engaged for a couple of months. From the beginning I told him about my issues of not wanting to be a mother, not biological because of many reasons: being responsable to bring another human being to this chaotic world, the many problems during pregnancy, postpartum depression, health issues, etc. He was ok with that but at some point he wanted to talk to me about it because now he felt that he wanted to be a father because he loves me. I told him that I was very open about adopting but he want a biological one. I carelessly told him that I would think about it because he said it was my decision and he will respect it. In the mean time, he proposed to me and I said yes. Fast forward to now, I was completely sincere about it and explained to him that I could bring the idea of being a biological mother. I made that decision long ago, in my twenties, long before we knew each other, and the fear and anxiety of the matter are still in me, I can't change that. Well... He didn't take my response too well. Now he thinks that it would be too difficult for him to change his mind but ""he would try"", that the adoption thing is just a patch and a thing that other people do almost like charity. I was shocked... I never expected all of that. I mean, I understand that its not easy but I feel like he didn't truly respect my opinion from the beginning and was just hoping to said yes to his request. I don't know... Besides, we have been having sex problems for months and its becoming a real problem with little or not solutions. More reasons to feel insecure about the motherhood/parenthood thing. Plus, we have 3 dogs and he was all lovely at the beginning but now he thinks that they're too much job. I can't bring myself to compare the two topics, at some point...
I don't know what to do. Maybe our relationship is over... Or he is in so much stress and saying things without thinking, I don't know. 
I would really appreciate some perspective in this.
And sorry for my english (not my first lenguaje).
Thanks in advance for your help.

tl;dr: My fiance wants biological children but I don't because of many fears (health issues, depression, etc) and he knew about it from the beginning. Now he is mad and thinking how hard it's going to be for him to not wanting them. He didn't thought about being a father before, just now. I knew my decision over a decade ago.

EDIT: Thanks for all your comments, advises, opinions and different perspectives about my problem. I'm really grateful and I will try to respond all of them as soon as possible.
I would like to clarify a couple of things:

-He didn't want kids from the beginning and thus our plans were the same. He change his mind this year and talked to me about it around the middle of it. I don't blame him for that because it's a personal topic, after all, and everyone has their own time for feeling it.

-I know I was in the wrong for thinking that I could change my mind. I was naive... I tried to focus about the good things and from time to time I image a child of ours and it felt nice, but immediately after that I thought about all the risks and problems. I really regret that as much as him for talking me about ir, even though he knew what I felt about it and we already talked it many times before.

-You're all right... We should brake up... And it's devastating. We were planning a future together, after all, but now we see things differently. I love him, he is my first authentic relationship, he is a good man and if he actually want to be a father one day, I don't want to be a burden, even if its means to walk different ways. It's not going to be easy, we live together, I have nowhere to go. And he is facing as much pain as I am.

286,How to address changing holiday plans,"TL:DR Holiday plans changed that I don’t have anything for Thanksgiving. I’m not sure how to inform my partner of this.

So my girlfriend (27F) and I (27M) started dating at the beginning of November (we have been seeing each other since September) and agreed to do Thanksgiving separately due to us having plans before getting together. She was planning on coming up on Black Friday for dinner to meet my parents.

My mom is sick and I told my mom if she isn’t better by today to let me know as I am going on a two and a half week work trip in early December to the UK. I also need to let my girlfriend know that we need to reschedule dinner on Friday.

However, this means I will be alone for Thanksgiving and we will have to reschedule her meeting my parents until the end of December. I am a tad bit frustrated by the situation, but there is nothing anyone can do about it, and I am not upset.

I am not sure how to address to my girlfriend that I will not have plans on Thanksgiving now when I tell her we need to reschedule Friday. Does anyone have suggestions on how to basically tell her this without seeming like I am trying to get involved in her plans?

I don’t want her to feel like I am trying to push my way into her plans, because I am not, but I absolutely need to be honest with her as well.

287,My (21F) friend (22F) bosses me around and doesn’t see me as an equal,"Hello everyone! One of my dearest friends have a tendency to boss me around and criticize me a lot.
For context I (21F) have ADHD and my friend (22F) has OCD. Our interactions are mainly her telling me what to do. Sometimes is for good reasons like hygiene (I shower but I forget to clean my nails or brush my hair stuff like that) or when I’m messy (I tend to be very messy) so she tells me to clean my stuff and stop leaving things all over the place, so she kinda calls me on things like that (we are not roommates or anything btw). Or my makeup skills, she says they are bad. She always tells me what to do, even what to wear sometimes, not in the best way. I appreciate her being honest tho.
Likewise, when I’m hype (like excited about something) she tells me to calm down or shut up. She also tells me to calm down when I’m chill and she is the one that is actually anxious. A lot of people have noticed this and have also admitted that I’m the calmest of the bunch.
She often tells me to hurry up, or screams at me but we all have to wait for her if she is doing her makeup. 
Or like today, we were doing homework together and said two words: and she was like shut up you both when she talked for about 10 minutes prior to us.

Likewise, when I’m telling her something like my problems, or even fondest memories or whatever she interrupts me or says something like shut up or stop or hurry up or just starts talking about something else. I’ve stopped telling her stuff about myself because of it.
She judges me when I tell her what makes me sad but if the same happens to her we have to be compassionate 
We always hang out whenever and wherever she wants to hangout but no one goes with me to the stuff I want to go (she would cancel last minute and then get mad if I can’t make it to her plans)
Last time I tried talking to her she got mad and told me that we weren’t in a relationship and that I should stop the drama.
I really lover her, even when she tells me that I stink or calls me out when I’m awake at 3am in the morning because although it hurts I know she will always be honest to me and she does this because she cares about me. Or that’s what she says. I don’t know what to do, how should I approach her or talk to her about it or maybe simply just stop being her friend (although I’m too attached)

I don’t know how to mentally cope or how to act without her. She will definitely shout at me at least once and I always react defensively. She’s going to criticize my clothes, my weight (from the illness), and if I cry she’ll scream at me. Oh my god. How do I act around her? How do I cope mentally?

But eventually I got Twitter because they had one and we interacted and stuff back when we were friends and a bit in the honeymoon period of dating. We would also interact a lot on tumblr and reddit and insta 

Over time I realized they weren't on Twitter that much and then noticed them signed in to another account, which they use now, and don't know I know? Or don't care that I know?

Also have reddit accounts and I removed them from followers. They have a secret tumblr, but so do I. I complain about real life stuff on Twitter and tumblr and they probably do too. We don't talk about the stuff because my partner doesn't like to. We avoid the other like the plague on tumblr now despite still following each other 

Insta we never posted on but used to send each other memes or flirty memes and now we don't do anything

Where is the line between having personal spaces and being too cold to the other? Like is this a good boundary to have or is it just more and more of distancing ourselves from each other?

I know this sounds silly given our ages but I'm just wondering if this is good and normal or not

I M30 did my MBA at a business school and there was this cute girl F27 that joined the next batch. We didn't interact much, but I have her on social media etc.

I've been doing online dating for 6 months, gone on a lot of dates but always feel it's better to actually know the person or have something in common. That's always missing. 

I feel like sending her a message along the lines of - ""sick of meeting strangers, do you want to give it a shot""? 

I see we're both looking for long-term relationships and have a lot in common, fitness, cycling, working in finance, and having a lot to talk about having studied in the same place and having a lot of common friends.

My only apprehension is being shot down. As I said, I don't know her too well and don't want to make a complete fool out of myself amongst my peers. 

I agree with ""you miss all the shots that you don't take"". But I'll admit to being conscious about my self-image and it's the only thing holding me back.

Would love advice. Thanks in advance. :)

292,Frustrated about not getting a heads-up that my partner’s mom is visiting?,"A load of context first: My (29 m) girlfriend (28) and I of about two years live in a very small two-bedroom apartment several states away from our shared hometown. I know “two bedrooms” might make it sound like it can’t be that small, but the two bedrooms and living room are all about the same size (with each able to barely fit a full-sized bed and a dresser) and between my gf and I and our two cats, we’re pretty much tripping each over each other as is. We’re both planning on going back home to spend the holidays with our respective families (I’m leaving December 15th; she’s leaving December 21st), and, because of my parents’ advanced age and the rise of COVID cases, I’ve been pretty upfront about how I’d really appreciate it if we could both play things a little safer, COVID-wise, in the week or so leading up to our trip. It’s important to me that I’m able to see my family during this time, and I’m anxious about getting them sick or having to cancel.

Compounding all this, my main source of income is working from home as an online college writing tutor, primarily late nights and during the weekends (it’s a strange, gig-style set-up—kind of like Lyft or DoorDash but for tutoring--that pays much better during these times). With the semester wrapping up, the weekend of December 9th – 11th will pretty much be my last work weekend of the year, and I’d been planning on working something like 24 – 30 hours those days to compensate for the next couple weeks. On top of this, I’m in the process of applying to grad school, and my application deadline is December 15th, so even though I’m trying my best to stay on top of deadlines, I already know that week is going to be stressful.

I was further stressed out when my girlfriend casually mentioned the other day that her mom will be flying in to stay with us from December 8th to the 12th. She dropped this very off-handedly, and only seemed to acknowledge that it was strange not to have given me a heads-up about it before the tickets were booked when I mentioned my frustration a few minutes later. They’re already planning on going to a few large events and shows during her mom’s stay, and even though I’ve expressed my concern, it would surprise me if they wore masks at these events. I’m very stressed about getting sick and having to cancel my trip home as a result of all this, and I already feel self-conscious that I’m going to be working through the majority of her visit. it’s my girlfriend and I’s first year living together, and although I’ve met her mom a few times, this will easily be the most time I’ve spent with anyone in her family. I’d like to make a good impression and get to know her mom better, but I’m feeling very frustrated and stressed out by the timing, and to have not been included in any way in the planning process. My gf was receptive to my feedback, but I’m preemptively anxious about the COVID of it all, and about her getting frustrated with me for not being able to spend much time with them while her mom’s in town.

I’d like to clarify that just because the timing is really bad for me doesn’t mean that the timing’s not ideal for my gf or her mom—I really just wish that, as her partner and roommate, I’d been given a heads up about all this before it was set in stone so that I could voice these timing concerns preemptively, even if they still ended up pulling the trigger on those dates. A lack of regard for my boundaries and autonomy has been a consistent issue since we’ve moved in together, and I’m having a really hard time expressing why all of this is bothering me so much. I love my girlfriend and I’m excited to get to know her mom better—I just feel like a jerk for being so bothered and stressed out, as I obviously want to get to know her family and want her to be able to see her family.

I can’t tell if it’s reasonable for me to be frustrated and upset, or if I’m just overreacting and getting too much in my head about it?

tl;dr: my girlfriend casually mentioned to me that her mom is coming to stay with us for five days in our small apartment at pretty much the worst possible time for me (work // grad school apps // COVID concerns) and I'm frustrated not to have been included in the planning process until after the flight was booked.",z1dfma,5,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z1dfma/frustrated_about_not_getting_a_headsup_that_my/,relationships
293,My hardworking Boyfriend is never reaching out to me (31M). Am I (24F) just expecting too much? And should I give him a break?,"We started dating some month ago, I am currently doing my internship abroad so its Long distance, but there is an end to it + we do see each other on holidays. He also told me that he wants to be with me, when I am back.

Lately, there have been days when he did not send one message. He always was a ""bad"" texter, yet he never went days without one sign. When I miss a call of him, I immediately call back but he does not pick it up and I feel like I missed my chance to talk to him this week (I'm its stupid). When told him, I got upset and started crying. Also because he literally never responds if I say that I miss him etc, or he never wrote any kind words. I told him he probably doesn't want to even comfort me. He got really upset and said he is hurt and I thought that of him. He is someone who shows love in service, and when we are together, it is a great time. However, I told him I wish more communication from him. He said, he usually would never do LDR again because of this. He hates being on the phone, and sometimes he feels pressured to ""call"" me, because he knows I'll be upset if he doesn't. He thinks it's childish of me to be upset about not getting a text. And he told me not to be mad or sad when he doesn't text back. But that he wants to be with me and he is in love and that he is constantly thinking about me. I just feel so mad and anxious, but then when he calls it seems fine. But then there are days of silence again and I am just asking myself how to react to that. 

I am just thinking, why is he still not doing the work, especially if he knows that it is so important to me? I am scared to always bring it up again, as I am just being labelled as childish. I also feel dumb sending texts if I never get something back. I know, that he is actually extremely busy and has some problems going on (finances etc.), but I just don't understand, why he does not really feel the urge to share it with me at the end of the day. I get it that if you have to wake up at 5:00 am the morning and come back at 10 pm, you are tired, but still? He used to do it on the beginning. Why he does not give me at least something, when he knows it would mean the world to me. I am not expecting 24/7 texting, but common, one message a day that at least says he cant call today? Rather he sends me some stupid videos on Instagram.

He did say, that he is serious about me because he wants to settle soon. He told me he wants me to be sure about it because he wants his next girlfriend to be the last. Yet I am just doubting everything if I think about it. Also, I am wondering how he will deal in the future with my feelings or issues that come up, that are part of a normal everyday relationship. Am I just overreacting? I can't stand anymore being sad or ""hoping"" for him to call him. Should I just tell him to not contact me for a while so he can focus on himself and I will feel better too?

Yesterday I (F23) posted that I was going to break up with my boyfriend (M23). Last night he noticed, We talked and I told him the truth, that I was breaking up with him. It destroyed me, I know that in the long run I will be happier but fuck. I still love him as a person. It hurts so badly to see how much I hurt him. I want us to go back to how it was before the long distance, I want us to be happy. But I can't live in that false life I kept
telling myself. I feel like the worst person on the earth. I cried non stop after. I feel so much guilt from hurting him. I wish things worked. All I want to do is cry and talk to my best friend but I can't anymore. I'm so fucking lost and distraught. I wish I never lost feelings.

295,Should I (22M {ap} ) apologies to the person I'm talking to (23F {fa} )," The question seems straightforward as if it should just be a yes, but it's a bit more complicated than that. I’ve been talking to this woman for a year and I've realized that I am a textbook anxious attachment style and she is some form of avoidant ( think is a fearful/ spice of life ). I invaded her personal space/alone time and it caused her to pull back and create distance; just that classic dance that happens in this type of relationship.

I feel I'm emotionally intelligent enough to work and change my anxious attachment , so some tips for this would be appreciated. I have given her lots of space after seeing her pull away and it's great. I'm wondering if I should apologize for entering her space, but I'm wondering if that is a trigger for an avoidant person. I want to say sorry I invaded your space. I saw how it made you feel so I did ‘x’. I want to assure her me accepting the space she needs isn't me abandoning her.

Any advice on this exact situation or any about an anxious-avoidant relationship would be greatly appreciated. If you are an avoidant how would you feel about a partner apologizing to you and are there any triggers I should try to avoid.

TLDR: Is it a good thing to apologize to an avoidant type partner or does that trigger the “you aren't perfect” since many seem to have a perfect partner in their minds",z1ni1r,1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z1ni1r/should_i_22m_ap_apologies_to_the_person_im/,relationships

297,"bf (M18) lies to me (F17) about close friend story with explicit images with two other girls on it, hiding it from me","I got a hey girlie text from some random chick, that my boyfriend (M18) of one year had a private snap story where he posted explicit pics of himself, shirtless and in the shower showing off his nude body and progress, slightly cutting out his part) this has just been a one time thing today i know of. I don’t know what to do. been in a relationship with this guy for a year now, really truly in love and just trying to work things out. 

I couldn’t believe it at first, I was in the middle of playing a game with him too as she messaged me, I sent a ss of our DMS to my bf and asked him what that was abt. he immediately denied it and said it was false, that she was wrong. I really didn’t know what to believe as even prior to this we were having issues with our relationship and trying to fix things— shit like him being more patient and considerate of my feelings etc and we reached a middle ground and somewhat felt better afterwards.(this talk was after whatever he did, i still didn't know). So I confront him and ask the girl more questions, atp i’m rlly unsure on who to believe. Boyfriend just keeps telling me it isn’t true & that it was from before we were together, i sent him more screenshots of me and the girls dm’s and he denies it still, i asked the girl for evidence and sure enough she had it. She told me it was from today so when I asked bf abt it he said it was before we were together, awhile ago while the girl is saying it’s from today. 

I see the evidence and see the date of the screenshot, it’s today, i show bf and he tells me that you can change the date on photos of when u took them ig? which i checked and u can. i’m still wary and completely melting down asking bf if it’s real or not. I noticed the BG of his shower and realized the same products in the screenshot are the same products in his shower currently bc i made him ft me to show the bathroom and i took a ss. i’m right bc that observation proved right when I saw that the products were the same, i confront him and he still denies it saying they have the same stuff, that his mom cleaned it and put it back etc saying he knows it true yada, i keep pointing out the similarities and getting more mad/hurt atp, he says ""are you really going to believe that"" some shit like that and saying it just isnt true. I beg him to just tell me the truth, he then calls me again and that's when i just knew. he breaks down and apologizes first, said he was scared of losing me so he panicked and tried to lie like a little kid fearing punishment. I start crying and go off on him kind of, just asking why and wtf he's doing. he says he doesn't know, he wasn't thinking. i said hes full of shit bc he wouldn't have done that if he cared abt me, he says he cares abt me and loves me and hes sorry adn he regrets it so much. and i'm hearing him out and going off on him, whyd he lie to me in the first place yk? he says he lied bc he was scared of losing me and just scared & panicked.. what do i do? do i give him another chance? he admitted this is the first time he done it and today was the only day and he messed up. he seems genuinely regretful and doesn’t know why he did it and he said it was impulsive and we’ve gone through sm together and talked about our futures, his family loves me and with thanksgiving rolling around they’ve been expecting me to come over too :(

ADD ON: i go off even more abt his disrespecting me, contradicting himself, embarrassing me etc treating me bad. he keeps apologizing and saying he knew it was wrong and he didn't know why he did it, smth abt him not being able to do anything 4 himself so he wants to feel better by showing off smth he does have, (his gym body) and that was on sc with two of his closest friends who have seen stuff like that before and 2 random girls ONLY. asked him why and he said he just didnt know why he did it. Today was the only day he's done something like this, he says he's been falling into a depression slowly and doesnt feel good abt himself anymore so this was a way of it..? i'm not sure. I dont understand completely, but hes begging for me to not leave and to give him one more chance. Begging that he will change for me after everything we've been through, i told him i didn't want to be with him anymore. Told him I hated him for what he did and lying to me like that. 

Hurts because I know how he is and he does genuinely love me, talking abt future and kids type love so its so difficult to understand why he'd do this. I wanted opinions from other ppl and maybe dudes who might know what he's got going on in his head. Just feel very betrayed and lied to, things were already rocky before this so super disappointed. he's just begging for me to forgive him and give him one more chance, what do i do? I genuinely love this man, [ were both broken people with past relationship trauma, he’s been cheated on before so.. if that means anything idk, and he truly does show that he loves me but this situation showed me he wasn't thinking of me..] and he admitted what he did was impulsive and he regrets it like sobbing and guilty for what he did as im saying im gonna leave, but I'm clouded too much by anger and hurt right now to really think of anything. i believe in second chances but i’m stuck on this, i really really love him and i’m very attached still. he’s gone out of his way countless times to be there for me and show me he loves me etc but this threw me off so hard bc you don’t do this to someone you love. I’m not sure.

298,I'd feel guilty breaking up with her,"I'm a 22M and my girlfriend is a 23F. We have been dating for about 5 months. We do have a loving relationship and I do love her but we are incompatible in some areas that I think hinder the both of us in the long run. These things include career choice, style of living, and culture. So far we have worked a lot on meeting in the middle, and in some areas we have, but there is no denying that it is still difficult at times. In short we love the way we treat each other but don't exactly love the way we do certain things, and if we do things differently it would be for the other person. In the end it works, but I don't know if it's the best.

She has told me that her family is toxic and while I kept a positive mind-set, she was right. Her dad treats her like a house-wife rather than her daughter. He expects her to do everything and doesn't want her to get a job or else he won't continue supporting her. She wanted to get herself a better car to get around and her dad started assuming that she was going to leave him forever and it was my fault that she is trying to do this, which is absolutely not correct. Her dad also expects me to randomly leave work early to attend family events, refuses to plan in advance, which is also insane because I certainly can not. Then he gets offended if I don't so I get frustrated back. He's also made comments that he would be happier if I was not in her life because he could have more time with her. I thought that was messed up.

Then, there's this other girl. 22F. I went out with her in the past and we really enjoyed each other but she went away for college so I didn't want to hold a long distance relationship. Now, she's back for good. Hate to admit it, but I know in my heart she is very much more for me. Her family is very very nice to me as well, much more than hers. She has her life together and aligns with my values more. 

tl;dr It is a tough situation for me because my girlfriend and I have worked hard to get to where we are today and she is very sweet, loyal, and passionate. I do enjoy being with her. She's on my side with her crazy dad and family. I know the saying ""the grass isn't always greener on the other side"". I'm thinking long term though, living together full-time and raising a family. Last thing I would ever want to do is make a mistake. But on the other hand, I just want nothing but the best for her and I.

299,Bad nightmares have returned from when I was little.,"tl:dr - really bad nightmares from a few years ago came back and i’m scared to tell my dad. 

sorry if this doesn’t belong. Idk where else to post this, because r/nightmares barely has anyone active who could help me. 
Anyways, I (13m) lost my mom to cancer when I was 11. As she was dying, we were at the hospital with her most of the time, so I saw how she got weaker and weaker. I stared having really bad dreams where I would be in the hospital with my dad dying like that too. It’s really hard to explain how he looks but it’s bad, worse than my mom even. 
The best way I can explain it is he looks like he’s dying of cancer, but on top of that, he’s bleeding out of his eyes, nose, and ears. I try to talk to him but he won’t respond. It ends with the heart machine thing beeping and him being taken away. There’s always a woman talking about foster care. 
These dreams came back three days ago. I can’t go back to sleep after, I try but it’s so hard to. I want to go get in my dad’s bed like I used to, but I’m not a little kid anymore. It’s really stressing me out and he’s noticed that I’ve been tired, but I’ve just blamed it on staying up late. I just woke up from one as of writing this and it took me almost 30 minutes to stop crying.

300,Can I contact my SO during our break in our specific situation?,"I can’t handle this pain at all and want clarity. 
 
Hey everyone! New to this sub + english is not my first language, so pls bare with me if I make some errors.

So I really don’t know what to do and would like the opinions of strangers to see what you guys think about my situation.

I’ve (21f) been in a relationship with E. (23m) for the past 5 years. Right on from the start, it has been intense. We almost immediately went to being together 24/7. There was mostly 1/2 days a week that I would spend at home, the other days of the week at this house. I had a difficult situation at home so his home felt like a safe haven + I was madly in love and super young

We had some difficulties and drama involving other people and there were fights involved, but we always found or way back to each other. During Covid, we had a really good time and we laughed a lot together. It just felt so good and cosy and we had so many ideas for our future. 

Although during that time our sex life was declining because I was feeling a little bit depressed and my libido was not as high as before. Still loved him to pieces and we are both people that carry baggage and trauma from our upbringings. I am in therapy now for that actually which is scary as hell.

Anyway, fast forward to 2021. I got my own apartment and we quickly moved in together. At first things were great, but then our peace was disrupted because 4 of our neighbors were friends of us and a lot of drama followed. Fights, gossiping, me and E. felt like our neighbors were like high school atmospheres all over again. This but a little bit of a strain on our relationship. 

But, I started to feel worse and worse in this place. It used to be an elderly home and I believe it may be haunted, but that’s another story. I just had a feeling this place wasn’t good for our relationship and we started bickering way more than before. Also I was in a bad head space because I just started therapy and was feeling quite emotional. he was away a lot and we didn’t spend really any quality time, and I was so caught up in my own process that I did not realise us not spending quality time was a core issue in our relationship. We had sex maybe once in 2/3 weeks, and I was longing for his true attention but did not really realise it and thought maybe we need alone time.

He thought so too, with everything that’s happened the past months. We had fights, and maybe we needed to date other people, we both thought.

Then one day he said, well let’s take a break. At first I agreed, I thought yeah maybe that will do me good or it will help us. But we didn’t talk it through thoroughly because he is not the talkative type and in my mind we would go back to the ‘dating’ phase, where you do not see each other as often but go do fun stuff.

Well, for him the break meant living a single man life and then seeing how he feels. So that already hurts. My own fault, ofcourse.

Fast forward to now, week 2, and I am in excruciating pain. In week 1 we had some contact and he was SO distant en told me he didn’t know how he felt about me and that he needed more space. During these conversations (on the phone, once face 2face) I was a total emotional wreck, longing for his embrace and telling me everything wil be okay. He did not do that. He told me he thought he had not been good for me these past months, because it hurted him to see me feeling sad and that was why he was away so much. So he knew he fell short in that. That hurt me bit also I knew he was right. He also said he french kissed a friend of his and wants to explore that a bit. 

FYI: we tried a bit of open relationship, during the past year (I am bisexual) and we agreed we could both kiss girls but no sex. For me that was fine, I was totally satisfied with him and I like girls so I wanted to explore that as well. During this I kissed 4 girls when out partying and he did not. He did not fall into those situations so when this friend grew closer to him he felt like this was finally a situation where he also could explore those feelings. We were honest to each other about this but I did not expect he would do something with her durin g this break. 

But because it’s a friend, and because of that more intimate IMHO, it hurted like hell when he told me they kissed and layed in bed together. I want to lay in bed with him…. 

So he said he wanted more time to think, while I already made up my mind that I want to be with him still. 

Now, it’s killing me. He is so distant and cold and we haven’t spoken in 3 days. I don’t want to be a wreck everytime we talk and also, because we were SO young when we got together, I don’t know who I am without him. I don’t know how to live in this appartment without him. I got so comfortable to him being there, I feel lost without him. 
And it seems like he does not have the same feeling.

Now, I’m longing for contact and clarity. It just feels so vague now, but everyone in my circle is telling me to NOT look for contact en to NOT reach out and ask how he is doing or ask to meet up. But it is all my heart wants…. 

I feel like this break is not doing me well and the only way I can move on is if we truly end things or if we come together and work through it. I want the latter, but maybe rationally it’s better for me to stay alone. To learn what it’s like to be alone, to become a person that is true to herself and proud of herself. Now I feel lost and lonely.

What do you guys think? Can I reach out and ask to meet and ask for clarity, or would that be selfish and should I give him more time? 

I just don’t think this break stuff is for me…I don’t have any desire to be dating other people and it hurts that he is exploring stuff with his friend.


TL;DR: the past 5 years, we always been together mostly, he initiated the break but I also thought it was a good idea, but now week 2 I realize i want to be together and the only way I can move on is to have clarity whether we’re breaking up or not. Can I reach out or should I give more space?

301,I feel unable to sustain long term friendships - is this normal?,"TL;DR the history of my friendships/relationships suggests I’ve lost a fair few over the years, I feel like I’m the problem?

I (25F) am in my second long term job out of university. My first job I enjoyed, but sadly it did not pay enough. I got on well with my colleagues, however lost touch with all except 2 when I left. 1 I did remain friends with has since ghosted me when I last asked how she was doing. No idea why, when I thought we were good…
The second we were close for a few years but drifted apart due to distance and differences of opinion (I felt she tried to buy my friendship and I ended up distancing myself).

At university I had a great 2 years in shared accommodation and made some good friends. Final year those friendships pretty much fell apart as I moved home due to poor mental health. I talk to 1-2 maybe once/twice a year, but a few I’m not on speaking terms with. 

At my current job I work closely with 2 females of a similar age to me. They feel like very different people to me, so I find it hard to relate to them. We chat, and have discussed meeting up outside of work, but I sense they prefer each others company over mine & hang out without me (they chat a lot more in the office too). 

Don’t get me wrong - I do have friends. 3 long term high school friends, and a few close mutuals I’ve made over the past 3 years, as well as a very close long distance friend. We holiday, go out, etc. I’ve also had a long term boyfriend, who is now my best friend (although we are separated).
But I can help but worry that I’m the common denominator in my other relationships/friendships not being long-term. Like I’m the reason none of these have been sustained, as if I’m unlikeable or people feel a certain way about me that means they don’t want me in their life.

302,"I (M21) cheated on my girlfriend (F22) on grindr, I need help","I (M21) cheated on my girlfriend (F22) on grindr about 6-7 months ago and she found out about a month and a half ago. 

About 6-7 months ago, my girlfriend and I were trying “anal” play on each other and I enjoyed it. But it lead me to be a little curious about my sexuality which I mentioned to my girlfriend. Her reaction seemed judgmental and very hurtful, I felt like I was being interrogated by the police when I told her. She had me take a sexuality test when I was half asleep and was pampering me with what seemed like judgmental questions. I felt hurt and alone so I for whatever reason downloaded grindr and talked to a few people and unfortunately shared a few pictures. This lasted no longer than an hour or so when I finally came to my senses. My curiously stemmed from a traumatic sexual experience I had when I was about 10 years old, which I told my girlfriend when she found out about the account. 

About a month and a half ago she found my old account and confronted me. I moved most of my stuff back in with my parents while she’s still at our apartment with our cats. We’re both absolutely devastated by what I’ve done and we don’t know what to do. Since I’ve moved out we’ve talked everyday, hung out, and we’ve even had sex a few times. She also has mentioned she was banking on us getting married, getting a house and having a family together, which we had  planned on doing very soon. We were in love and we’ve never had such a stronger connection with anyone else before. 

In the last month and a half I’ve started 2 new jobs to make as much money as possible, started therapy and working out, and I figured out my career path in real estate and I take my exam in the next few weeks. I also am 2 months sober. 

I’m so lost on what to do regarding our relationship as I’m deeply saddened by my actions and how much I’ve hurt her. I became something that I hated and I’m doing everything to change for the both of us.

304,Can't help but feel guilty after my first breakup,"I am 28 and just went through my first breakup ... my ex had borderline personality disorder but he bought me lots of lavish gifts that I never asked for. He got me an LV wallet and scarf, a dyson straightener and hair dyer, tiffany bracelet, expensive jacket, boots, and 2k diamond earrings. He would always go out of his way to buy me little gifts and flowers all the time. I just don't feel good because when we broke up he asked for everything back that he bought me and even said rude comments to me like I am going to end up alone forever with just my cat...

I don't know if I should just throw everything in the garbage. He was the only man who ever bought me anything but in the end he just became bitter and resentful for having ever bought me anything.

305,"Should I (21F) stay with my financially unstable, artsy boyfriend (22M)?","I come from a poor background. My parents didn't graduate high school and were very financially irresponsible. I spent most of my teenage years helping them get out of debt (including paying lawyers to file for their bankruptcy). I have tried my best to not be like them. I am graduating from a top college debt free. I have a 6 figure job, 20k in savings, and a separate retirement plan all by 21.

My boyfriend comes from an upper-middle-class family, basically the exact opposite of my upbringing. Both his siblings and parents went to college but he didn't. He wanted to follow his artistic pursuits. His parents support him still, but not as much as I would expect. He is working a minimum-wage job while doing art on the side.

We have been together for a year and finances weren't an issue at the beginning. I was a broke, college student and he was a broke, young artist. But now that I am graduating, I want to travel and have a more comfortable life than I did as a child. He said he wants to pursue a comfortable life too but has also said he would be happy staying at his current low-paying job for a few years.

Even though there is a financial gap between us, he doesn't expect me to pay for him. But also I don't want to lose out on experiences because he can't afford to do them with me. I have brought up things like going back to college or applying for better jobs, but he says those things make him anxious (also it sometimes sounds like I don't support his art).

I do genuinely love him and I am willing to wait for him to become more financially stable, but his current lack of ambition makes me worried that this will never happen. What should I do?

306,"My future mother in law wants to buy my wedding dress, but it’s upsetting my mother. I don’t know how to talk to her about it without seeming ungrateful.","
I 23f got engaged to my fiancé 26m this past spring. His family has always been very supportive of our relationship and very welcoming/caring and we get along well.

This past weekend I went dress shopping for the first time with my mom, my future mother in law, and a few friends. Before going my mom originally said she wanted to pay for my dress. But my future mother in law told me she wanted to buy my dress instead and to disregard the budget I had originally set for the dress, and get whatever dress I wanted. She said she didn’t want me to feel limited and wanted to make sure “I’d have the perfect day” and that “it was the least she could do”

While I am very grateful for her offer, I could see how this made my mom uncomfortable and a bit sad. Originally I had came to an agreement with my mom to spend max of $1000 on a dress since it’s what she could afford, which I am very grateful for.

My fiancés family is significantly wealthier then my family, and this has been very evident during wedding planning. I was fine having a smaller more low key and affordable wedding but my future mother in law keeps offering to pay for things and keeps telling me not to worry about costs. 

I don’t know how to talk to her about this without seeming ungrateful, because I truly do appreciate her offers but I’m just not sure I’m comfortable with it. And it really hurt me to see how upset my mom was when she offered to pay for my dress instead.

I just don’t want to seem ungrateful or rude but I feel like I need to express how I really feel as wedding planning continues.

TLDR : My fiancé’s family is wealthier then mine and my future mother in law is offering to buy my wedding dress. This is upsetting my mother since she wanted to buy it. I don’t know how to talk to my MIL about this without seeming ungrateful, when I do appreciate her offer but don’t want to upset my mom.",z1h1wj,2,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z1h1wj/my_future_mother_in_law_wants_to_buy_my_wedding/,relationships

So we broke up a month ago but then i basically disrespected her because I assumed something but i found out i was wrong on the 19th of Oct.I apologized but she didn’t respond until my birthday on the 25th. I’m blocked on literally everything right now but snapchat but recently she has unfriended me on that too. But I can still contact her on that, so i waited about 3 weeks after the whole argument to talk to her, we talked for a small moment and then she ghosted me. And then I continuously tried to reach out to no avail or response but she still post subliminal posts about me on IG and FB, I guess she’s assuming I’m stalking her which is correct but I don’t know if i’m being delusional that she wants me to fight harder for her or she wants me to leave her tf alone. Because I’m still not blocked on that ONE platform and she still posts sublimals (albeit sometimes bad ones) and also ones clarifying she doesn’t talk to anyone else at the moment. Someone please help. I heard that if you give a women too much space she will just move on so should I just leave her alone or keep trying???

308,I (F19) am thinking about taking a break from my boyfriend (M20) of 6 years. Is it right for us to see other people during our break?,"My bf and I have been together for 6 years, since we were still kids. It's weird to think that we started dating when we were 13 and 14 but we've been through some shit together that has made our relationship stronger. His parents getting divorced, my mental health struggles, personal friendship breakups, going to college (we go to different colleges but are still in the same area. He goes to community college and I am going to a university), etc. 

Again, we have literally grown up together and have this amazing sense of comfortability with each other that I don't have with anyone else. I'm an only child with a single mother. I don't have any siblings and I'm not close with my extended family. I hold my friends near and dear to my heart because I see them more as my family. My boyfriend is MY person. I tell him everything. He knows me better than anyone else on this earth. He is my best friend. 

Just over a year ago I started therapy for my personal journey. I love every aspect of it and I believe it's made me a better person and gain a new perspective on life. My therapist is also another person in my life I can tell anything to besides my bf. I believe my boyfriend needs therapy. However, he can't afford health insurance which is why he chooses not to go to therapy despite how much I try to push him. But recently I've noticed a lot of things I haven't noticed before. 

My bf and I share the same friend group and in our group my bf can come off as arrogant. I asked him why some of our friends would call me confident but never call me arrogant, but they would flat our call him arrogant. He sorta chalked it  up to there needs to be an asshole in the group of friends therefore he is the asshole of our group??? idrk, he said he would work on how he acts in our group but we'll see. Additionally, when we get into serious fights I feel like I have to thin 5 steps ahead of him to even get my point across. My bf is so much smarter than me and always just knows what to say. And when he says something to disprove my point I have to have something locked and loaded to counter it. Some of our conversations feel more like a debate class than an actual conversation. Sometimes our serious conversations are like mind-games and I absolutely hate it. I feel like I'm being manipulated in an indirect way. I know he isn't manipulating me on purpose but that's what it feels like sometimes. 

After quarantine and the pandemic his study routine (or any routine in general) has gone out the window. He is so incredibly smart (33 on the ACT, and will pass any test without studying) he could literally do anything his put his mind to if he actually applied himself. Right now my bf doesn't really have a plan for his career at all, which is totally fine with me. I very much understand some people may need more time to figure out what they want in life and I 100% support him and I've told him this. But he's currently failing all of his classes at community college. If he can't pass his classes this semester he won't be able to transfer to the university he wants. It's not that he can't do the work (it's literally community college) but he can't bring himself to just sit down and do his homework. 

Truthfully, I feel like my bf doesn't care about a lot of things, things that are internal and external to our relationship. He doesn't really have a drive or passion to do anything and if I'm going to be honest,  I am tired of it all. I have told so many times, I support him with whatever he wants to do but it's very hard to support him when he doesn't have anything he really wants to do. I believe relationships should be 50/50. Even when a relationship is 51/49 there is an unfair balance in the relationship, one person is still putting more effort into the relationship than the other person. That's how I see my relationship with my bf right now. A lot of the things I ask him to do, he won't do unless I sit down with him and we do it together. One example of that is looking for a place to live together. 

We don't live together yet and chose to live apart for almost another 2 years so we can continue to grow as adults and as people. But his living expectation for what he can afford is a bit outrageous for where we are living. I told him he should find places that are up to his expectations, I find places that are up to my expectations and then we can come together and discuss our options. But he says he won't look unless we look together. 

I am very mentally exhausted trying to support and help my boyfriend while also supporting myself as a person. 

There are plenty other examples in our relations that reflect the one-sidedness of things, but this is just the surface. I love my boyfriend so much. I truly see us getting married and living our lives TOGETHER. But I don't want to be with him if he can't be self-sufficient or provide the same amount of support I provide for him. 

We are currently on a 3-week vacation with his immediate family so I didn't want to bring anything up before we left. But once we go back home I think I'm going to take a break for a bit. But I don't know if I should propose the idea of seeing other people during this break? I haven't really had another SO other than my currently bf. If I'm going to be honest, it would be sorta nice to meet other people and see how they treat me in a relationship since I don't really know otherwise. 

Again, I love my boyfriend SO much but I feel like I need some time to grow myself as a person if I want to continue this relationship. There's plenty of other aspects about our relationship I haven't mentioned (if we break up what happens with our friend group? I'm super close with his family, do I cut off his family? How do we split the big things we've paid for together? etc) I'm just at a cross roads right now and I need some advice. 

oof sorry for the long post. Thank you for anyone who has made it this far. Love to all of you! <3

309,"Me [22 M] and my ex partner [21 F] have been broken up for 2 months now, how to deal with feeling pretty empty inside?","Pretty standard question here, ex and I have been broken up for 2 months now after dating for about a year and a half. We were long distance for a fair amount of it, but saw each other for at least a few days every month. I was really struggling with the distance near the end of it, and went through a tough break up, but still on pretty amicable terms. We have kept in light contact, just a few texts since, and have repeatedly emphasized that we're there for each other if we ever need anything. It was definitely the most meaningful romantic relationship I've had.

Haven't been quick to rush into anything since, work hours have increased, and have focused on maintaining more active friendships since. All in all I have been handling it okay externally , but internally have felt pretty emotionally empty since. Was just wondering if anyone had any advice or solace in going through this?

For context I have a good relationship with a therapist I see regularly, but not gaining much from that at this point. Would really appreciate any input!

310,i feel like my “best friend” isn’t actually my best friend,"
so i (f17) met my best friend (f17) through our friendship group. i knew her for 5 years prior but we both got close when our friendship group treated us like shit and we bonded over the fact that we were left out. 

we became close very quickly and i learnt that she had depression, anxiety and undiagnosed adhd (this was part of the reason why our ex-friendship group left her out). i tried my hardest to be super supportive and made sure she was always comfortable. i tried to stand up for her as best as i could considering i was still recovering from the 2 years of mistreatment from my ex-friendship group. we were essentially each other’s support systems coming out of that friendship group and i relied on her a lot (as she relied on me) as i was feeling a range of different things and so was she (for context: we were in this friendship group for roughly 6 years but she knew them longer)

in the summer of that year, she moved away back to her home country. it was really hard saying goodbye especially since we created this support system for each other and i didn’t know what it would be like when she was gone since she was going to be in a new environment and meeting new friends and i was going to be stuck in our small community with the toxic friendship group. 

after she left, we would talk all the time until she just stopped replying to me and would reply once every 1 to 3 weeks. i was struggling a lot since i felt so alone and whenever she would reply, she would barely reply to what i said and then go and talk about all of her new friends and how awesome they were. i tried to be as supportive as i could but it was really hard. her barely responding went on for about 9 months but she would still call me her best friend and always told me how much she would miss me. 

something that bothered me was the fact that since i was so used to talking to her everyday and she was essentially my only friend, i would send her messages every one to three days so when she wouldn’t open the messages until three weeks later, there would be tons of messages that were piled up and she would often “jokingly” complain about how much messages i would send and how overwhelming it was for her and i would feel bad so i would apologize which now that i think about it, feels quite wrong. 

anyway, throughout that time, i would often tell her about things i was planning to do and ask for advice  and whenever i would ask for her opinion, she would say things like “that’s a stupid idea” and “you’re going to regret that”. it felt as though she would never say “good for you, you got this!” 

my family and i are currently travelling since we left our home and our moving internationally. because we have no where to stay, we are staying in airbnbs over the course of 7 months in different countries and we can’t stay in one place for too long. we travelled to this one country near where my best friend lives so she flew out to come stay with us, i was so excited!! now don’t get me wrong, she had an amazing visit and i enjoyed having her there but i began to notice little things that wouldn’t make me feel good. she would be quite rude and make it clear if she didn’t like something and she would make absolutely disgraceful comments about how my family is “rich” because we are travelling when i literally explained to her multiple times that we do not have a home and we have no where to go. there were times when my parents weren’t able to pay for her train ticket and she would complain to me about how we should pay since she is the guest and we are “so rich” (we did pay for a lot of things for her, the only time she didn’t pay was for a train ticket, a sandwich, a snack and she would pay for herself when just her and i would go out without my family, she was also given money from her family to spend so it wasn’t her own personal money but she did pay for her plane ticket out which i didn’t know about till after she purchased it). 

ever since she left, she barely has messaged me and has been super bland and complaining about her problems. she never asks me how i’m doing and when i do tell her, it’s like she is only listening with one ear. i wanted to participate in this thing for school and when i initially asked for her advice, she told me to not do it and i was going to regret it. later on i decided i wanted to participate anyway so i told her i’m going to do it and she was immediately supportive which is weird because she was the exact opposite when i initially asked her so her responses felt super empty and meaningless. 

i feel like i can’t talk to her honestly because of her mental illness and she keeps telling me now that her friends aren’t treating her well and she really misses me. i feel like such a doormat because i was always so careful to make sure that she was comfortable and okay and i never really made sure if i was comfortable or okay. i feel like when we initially became close, i put her on some sort of pedestal and now that i’ve spent some time away, im realizing she isn’t as great as i thought but it’s hard to stop viewing her on that pedestal. i don’t even know if i like her as much as i did before, perhaps i’m realizing i don’t need her as much? still, i feel guilty for distancing myself from her but she doesn’t really make me feel good and confident about myself. i just need some advice if i’m overreacting or not. obviously, everything here isn’t the full story but i haven’t lied or left out any relevant info.

311,"How do I (F18) choose between these two people: my ex (M18) and my bf (M18), please read my story and help me?","Hi! I have been struggling for two months to find an answer, i asked a lot of people, but it is too hard. Here is my story

I have had a relationship for almost 3 years with someone i know for 11 years now. (Let's call him Eric). We decided to break up on april this year. Reason: ""We are teenagers and we feel like we need to experience more."" But I feel like we have not assumed this decision and we still kept in touch as
we had the same group of friends. At first, he treated me very badly: He called me a freak because I was hurting and I wanted to talk to him, he ignored me and made me feel very badly by manipulating me. I was in a very bad place and he didn't seem to care.


After a few months I started going on dates (they all failed). When he realized that I was starting to feel better he contacted me and we started to talk again. Eventually we also started meeting. We believed that we are made for each other and we do this (having other experiences) for our emotional development, as we are very young, so it seemed to be an unofficial opened relationship. 

I met someone new in september. (Let's call him Robert). He was very different from everyone I had met. We were getting along so well, that after one week we decided to start a relationship. As the time went by, I started neglecting Eric, and I did it so badly that he was in a deplorable state, the same
way I felt when he treated me badly (but I did not do it on purpose).


After one month I found myself in the position to choose one of them. And I chose Robert, by just letting things happen around me, instead of changing them myself.


During this time, Eric and I were on a rollercoaster, having periods of time when we talked, and other periods when we didn't, because I kept lying to him about my boyfriend Robert. So, for one month I went in a million places with Robert and we evolved
a lot. But one day I lyed Eric again and he blocked me. And that was the time when I realized that this is not good. At the same time I felt like i have lost my feelings for Robert and I wanted to be with Eric again.


So, I told Robert that I might break up with him (again, as I have done the same thing one month before, but ended up choosing him), and also telling Eric that I might come back. 

Today I deleted my social media and I told them both that I need some time alone.

And we are here, in the present, where I have to choose what to do.

So that you can understand:
1. I wanted to get back with Eric because I feel like I haven't done enough for us.
2. I can see only Eric as a potential partner for life, and sees me.
3. I can't think about Robert as my partner for life, but he sees me that way.
4. Robert doesn't know how I feel about Eric, I told him this situation is due to a personal problem.
5. They are both very loving and promise to be there for me.
6. Robert treats me like as good as possible.
7. I am afraid Eric haven't changed and can not treat me as Robert does, even if he says he could.
8. Robert is so close to be ""perfect"" but I just cannot have peace of mind letting Eric go, so I feel like I can not continue even tho I wish this so much.
9. I also want to be back with Eric as I love him so much and I feel we are made for each other but I am afraid it wouldn't work again and I feel so bad leaving Robert.
10. Eric says ""Come home"" and Robert says
""GO forward"".


They both love me very much and would do
anything to make me stay. I can imagine how my life would go with both of them (separately).

Please help me! I already know the two answers:
1. Choose 2 because it made you stop thinking about 1. But the problem is that they ""interchanged"" so many times and I don't know anymore who is 1 and who is 2.

2. Chose neither of them as if one was good you would have known already. But I just feel like it is not the right option for me, as two people love me so much and I just kick this love.


Thank you for your time.

312,My (M30) partner (F29) told me she doesn't see a future with us. We have two kids together,"My (M30) Partner (F29) told me last night that she doesn't see a future with us. We have two kids

We've known each other/been together for 6 years, and our oldest is 5, and our youngest is 3.

We met on tinder, and only knew each other for 4 months before she broke the news that she was expecting.

Frankly, I was absolutely terrified of the thought of my situation when I was told, but the last 6 years have been great. I love my partner, I love being a parent, and I have grown so much personally, and have shared many great experiences with my family.

That being said, her feelings have been slowly souring for me for years now.
It started when I forgot her birthday in 2018.
Her birthdays since have been quite lackluster, and she values birthdays, so that has been a factor.

Another thing is that we are common law, not married.
I personally don't like marriage, but we had never spoken about the issue until 2020.
I had a friend ask me when I would marry her, and I decided to ask her thoughts about it.
She said she would be fine either way, so i thought nothing of it. A year later she was mad at me for asking and not doing anything about it, at which point she spelt out for me that she would in fact like to be married.
For many long winded reasons I still haven't proposed.
Her mood has gotten worse because of it.

Third problem is she feels objectified by me.
Our libidos are mismatched, and our outlooks on sex probably has a factor.
She's confessed to me multiple times that she feels like a piece of meat to me, and only has sex cause she feels like it's her responsibility. 

Everything ties into what she believes is a lack of appreciation, thoughtfulness, love, etc.

For some context, my parents haven't been too big on anniversaries, and they've never worn their wedding rings for as long as I can remember. 
My family has also never been big on birthdays, they've usually passed with little fanfare. My dad doesn't even celebrate his.

My partner however values birthdays greatly, and puts in tons of effort for our kids parties. She also values the romantic symbolism of marriage.
But the thing is, she comes from a divorced family. 
Her mom left when she was 8, and her dad quickly hooked up with her stepmom who is diagnosed bipolar, and verbally and mentally abused her for years.
She moved out as soon as she was done high school and has only visited back home a handful of times.
This has definitely caused some kind of mental trauma which she has admitted to many times over the years, but doesn't try to find solutions for it.
I've never suggested therapy even though it undoubtedly would be beneficial.
While her symptoms don't suggest a mental disorder, she still has drastic mood swings semi regularly, and when she gets mad I might as well not talk to her for half the day or even days.
She will sometimes gaslight me, says hyperbolic things like ""you always do x"", or give the cold shoulder leaving me hanging with our argument unresolved.

She also did sex work on the side for a short while before we met, and it took her years before she realized that it has had a partially negative effect on her mental image and self worth, and outlook on sex.

She puts on a very confident face, but I know she's very insecure about herself.
She has body issues even though she's gorgeous, and she's currently very insecure about that fact that she's a stay at home mom a.k.a doesn't have a job.

I've never once told her how to use our money, or given her grief for the way she's spent it, nor have I ever said she either needs to be a stay at home mom, or that she has to get out and get a job, I've always been supportive of her choices, yet she still feels insecure about it, so I know the issue is from within.

As far as for me, I'm not trying to make her out to be only at fault, I certainly have my own issues and problems.
I probably am pretty thoughtless, and can be lazy and selfish. I also have been pushy for sex multiple times.
I am probably not very good with romance either.

The thing is though, we're both pretty good parents, both have shared interests and have a great time together hanging out and doing things, and for the most part live a quite blessed life.

TL;DR I'm asking if anyone has any insight into my problem, because I want to make my partner feel special and appreciated, and I'm terrified of the thought of what we have ending over something I feel can be fixed.
I can provide more details and context for those who ask.

313,My boyfriend (23m) of 5 months videorecored us while having s#x,"My boyfriend (23m) videorecored us while having s#x. I (18f) don't know how to react.

We've been fighting for 2 weeks now but we still see each other over the weekends. Last week was the worse one yet but he still came over at my place. After arguing we slept throughout the night (we sorta fixed the problem but not completely) and at morning we had sex. While ? I had some weird feeling and asked him why isn't he using another hand; he just laughed it off and started using both hands. Weirdly I was very quiet during it. While he was showering I went thru his phone and saw a 28sec black video and heared just moaning sounds, mostly his, I don't know if he recorded us in the dark and I don't know am I on the video because I didn't turn the phone screen light on more. I think I'm not but I'm scared I am.
I'm sick in my stomach when I remember those sounds and I don't know what to think or do. I didn't tell him I saw it because i figured i could snoop around more next weekend and maybe delete videos if there are any. But now when i think about it I'm so close to calling him and asking tf was that. That's the only video he has like that, as i saw it. I wonder is that normal thing? Maybe it has to do anything with those fights...
I feel like I'm a bit overreacting if it was just sounds, as I said I didn't see anything but black screen but who knows, the room was dark too. As I went through his gallery all I could see is just pictures of me, screenshoots of pics I sent (just outfit shows and selfies nothing kinky). My friend and I think he wants to have those videos to jerk off on it (as he said he doesn't watch po%n but who would actually 100% believe that) or he's afraid of losing me so he needs that. I doubt he would send it to anyone or post it. Before it he asked me what I think about moving in with him next year at my town as he planned on moving here to be closer to me. 

Maybe a male could explain it to me...

My partner (27M) and I (30F) have been together for nearly 8 years now. In 2021 we had a baby together which was unplanned, but we embraced the journey together since we loved each other and had already been together so long. Our baby is now 18 months old and we both absolutely adore her beyond words. Although my partner is a loving and devoted dad to our child, he has been a difficult partner to have in several other departments, especially after the baby was born. Due to several factors he struggles a lot with various mental health issues (depression, anxiety, anger). He usually copes by smoking cannabis. When he doesn't have access to cannabis he turns to alcohol which has resulted in some pretty major incidents of drunken rage. Our state became legal for cannabis last year so he has been largely able to steer clear of alcohol this year, but at the same time his choice to use it as a crutch instead of seeking real help for his mental health has had a detremental effect to our relationship. He goes through ups and downs constantly with his mood and it leads to him not taking care of himself and severely neglecting his household duties. He at least makes an effort when taking care of our baby but even then he gets easily overwhelmed if she is being fussy or needy on any given day (as is normal for any baby). When he is really struggling and doesn't have access to weed or beer he will hide in bed all day either sleeping or obsessing over certain anxieties. When he's like this anything can set off his anger so I have to walk on egg shells. On top of this he has refused to get a job over the past year and a half promising he is going to start his own business. Unfortunately his ideas never pan out or are to far fetched to even start. The biggest issue is that as much as I am trying to make this work, his mental health struggles totally prevent him from moving forward or making any improvements to our situation. I am constantly the one to manage the household, work to support us, and generally get things done and I am completely burnt out. I am currently sick for the second time in a month and have still been the primary person to look after our baby all day, plan out meals, tidy up etc.

I know I'm really the one who messed up here by not seeing the huge red flags before deciding to raise a baby together. These issues have been there all along but I was too blinded by love and insecure about being able to find another person to love that I made excuses for him. I had silly romantic (unrealistic) ideas that maybe having a child would help him mature into the adult partner I need. That isn't to say he hasn't matured or grown at all in the past year and a half but there are still so many ways in which he didn't.

Before I finish this post I do want to give him a fair chance as of course talking only about the negatives in our relationship is going to make him sound like a total AH or at least paint him in a very negative light, or at the very least make me look like a total idiot for hanging on this long. Outside of my partners major issues, we are really good together. We are great friends and get along extremely well when things are good. Our personalities mesh together really well which is how we feel in love and have lasted this long. His contribution to our household is not as much as it should be but it's not nothing, and he is capable of stepping up and being a good support system at times (assuming he is in a good place mentally). Our baby absolutely adores him, he is primary caregiver when I'm working. At times he really steps up and is an excellent father. The biggest issue is that it's not consistent. We could have an amazing day together as a family and the next day he's falling apart and I'm totally stressed that I'm having to deal with his breakdown amongst everything else. At times I feel fed up and want to get in my car drive to my parents and just put a sudden end to our relationship. What keeps me hanging on is our baby. I absolutely hate the idea of our little family breaking apart and what impact that will have on our child. We had a falling out earlier this year where he promised to seek mental health, but nothing has been done to seek it out. I have a hard time discussing anything about our relationship and my feeling without him spiraling, getting angry, or playing the blame game. I feel like I am at an impasse and don't know what to do next.

TL;DR: My partner of 8 years struggles with mental health issues which negatively affect his ability to be a good relaible partner and a good dad. He has not tried to get help and I am extremely stressed managing so many things on my own and walking on eggshells around him.",z1jb64,1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z1jb64/coming_to_terms_with_my_partners_mental_health/,relationships
315,Girlfriend (26) won't help with chores. How do I talk to her about this?,"My girlfriend (26) and I (m24) have been living together for about four years now, and it's very difficult for me to get her help around the house. For some background context, we do have two cats and I have ADHD, and oftentimes I do forget past events. This is probably important knowledge for later. 

Anyway, on to it then. In the four years we have been together, I've noticed that she only tends to ""clean"" by tidying up very small areas. I'm usually very appreciative, but lately it's actually been getting on my nerves because she'll leave things like piles of dishes or laundry and just tidy up the entryway room, and call it a day (not even vacuuming/mopping/etc. Just picking up mail.) She also does cool about one meal a day, and she prefers to handle the shopping as well (order online, no going in) 

However, this leaves the dishes, laundry, floors, bathrooms, etc all on me. At first she said it was because I didn't work, and I respected this even though it was overwhelming. Now, I have two jobs, and I'm still expected to pull the same amount of work. When I do bring this up, she gets incredibly defensive, to the point where it makes me feel like I'm not actually doing enough, so I just stop. 

However, I'm starting to worry that this is gaslighting or something similar. It just doesn't make sense that she only has to tidy up mail, cook, and buy food (which I would be happy to do, btw) while I'm constantly having to handle everything else around the house. If I just let it go (happens often, I simply don't have enough time anymore to get all of this done) she tells me that I'm lazy and that this is why our relationship isn't working. I don't know how to tell her I just don't have enough hours in a day to get all of this done, and I'm even having to clean profusely while sick just to keep up. 

Not sure if I should just call it quits on the relationship or if I should talk to her further about this and stand my ground instead of feeling bad. I've offered to pay for couples therapy, but she just doesn't see it necessary. Has anyone experienced this before, am I crazy lmfao? 

tl;dr I think the household chores are uneven and my partner is very defensive about this, not sure if I'm actually in the wrong or being gaslit.",z1j9iq,1,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z1j9iq/girlfriend_26_wont_help_with_chores_how_do_i_talk/,relationships
316,Confused about a coworker friendship that turned romantic,"My coworker (28 m) and I (30 f) fell in love while he was in a seemingly happy relationship.  At the time, I was involved in a toxic, back-and-forth relationship and he was in a stable, year long relationship.  We started out as friends.  We worked in the same department and our personalities just clicked right off the bat.  While we considered ourselves to be just friends at that point, other coworkers would make comments to me asking if there was something going on between us.  Our chemistry was noticeable, even though no lines had been crossed.  

He ended up leaving the job and I was sad to see him go, but genuinely happy for him to be expanding his horizons and pursuing his passions and we stayed in touch as friends. Then one day, he contacted me and confessed that he had feelings for me the whole time we worked together.  I admitted that I felt the same way.  It was scary because I truly valued our friendship and it felt like once we admitted our feelings we could never go back to the way things used to be.  

He made it clear that although he felt that he was in love with me, he was not planning on ending his current relationship immediately due to circumstances beyond his control - namely, his concerns for his girlfriend's declining mental health.  I told him I understood and let him know that I wanted him to remain in my life, even if we couldn't be in a relationship together.  We both agreed that we meant that much to each other and we both valued our relationship in a way that was more than just romantic.  And so, we tried to remain friends for months - though sometimes there were lapses in communication.  

During this time I entered into a committed relationship with someone else and I was honest with him about that.  Since then, we've stopped talking.  Our last communication was me sending him a text message on his birthday, wishing him a good day.  He never responded.  Sometimes I find myself thinking about him.  His birthday is in a few weeks and it will be one year since I last reached out to him.  I miss my friend.  I thought that our relationship meant more to us than just the romantic feelings.  I thought that we were trying to be just friends.  He seemed to have made his decision to stay in his current relationship (of almost 6 years at this point), but now that I've moved onto another relationship he's gone.  

To this day, I can't help but ruminate about our relationship and wonder, did he ever really love me or was he just using me as an emotional crutch while dealing with a failing relationship?  Why did he stop talking to me?  Should I reach back out to him?  Has anyone ever been in a similar situation and what did you do?  

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm having a hard time moving on emotionally from a friendship that turned romantic and I find myself thinking about this person non-stop even though he stopped communicating with me.

317,I (M18) don't understand why my girlfriend (17F) doesn't want to see me more,"I (M18) have been with my girlfriend (F17) for a little over 2 months. We've been close friends for over a year before and have recently said we love each other. She’s busy a lot of the time so we generally see each other around twice a week. That’s fine, but lately I’ve gotten the impression that I place a lot more importance on seeing and spending time with her than she does, and would ideally like to see her more than I do but I’m not sure the feeling is reciprocated. We’ve told each other we love each other and I have no doubt about that. But one thing I struggle getting my head around is if one has the opportunity to see their significant other more why would they not do it enthusiastically? 

For example, she said that if she’s free on a Tuesday and Wednesday, she would be fine just seeing me one of those days and wouldn’t feel the need or great desire to see me on the other day. I generally initiate asking when she’s free and she seems content with not seeing me as often and has said she doesn't really really mind how often she sees me and gets to spend time with me. I am pretty certain it’s not a reflection of her feelings for me but it still is a source of confusion for me and has made me overthink a lot. Why do I seem to value spending time with her and seeing her more often than she does with me? Can anyone help explain why this might be and the reasoning behind it? 

Tldr; girlfriend doesn't put much enthusiasm and effort into making plans and seeing each other often week, I want to see her as much as possible. Why doesn't she want to?",z16hvf,3,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z16hvf/i_m18_dont_understand_why_my_girlfriend_17f/,relationships
318,Gf (27/F) barely talks to me (26/M) 3 months in to our long distance relationship,"My gf and I have been together for just over a year now. 3 months ago I moved about 8 hours away for a job on a 2 year contract. I’m fairly new in my career, and this job doubled what I was making before as well would give me the experience that I could work anywhere in my field which is the reason I took it. 

My gf wasn’t too pumped about doing long distance but agreed that we would give it a try. She’s never been big on using her phone, and often times takes days/ weeks to get back to someone. She’s always gotten back to me reasonably quick when we lived close, but now that I have moved she’s starting to get the same way with me.

Every time I call she’s almost always too busy to answer or it’s not a good time, so it’s resorted to her calling me when we talk. She text me that she’ll call me in 5, but it’s a 50/50 chance that she will or won’t, saying that something came up or she forgot. When I text her it’s about 50/50 if I get a reply, usually about 6 hours if I do get one. I’ve been back once a month to visit, but she has yet to come here.

I’ve told her that I’m getting a little frustrated in how she replies, and it makes me not even want to reach out since they go unanswered a lot of the time, but she says that she’s never been good with her phone or will see a text and then forget to reply, but she’ll try to do better but so far nothings changed.

Reading back what I wrote it reads to me like things are heading to an end, which I’d like to avoid if possible. When we do talk on the phone or FaceTime everything seems like normal and she’s happy to talk to me, but I was wondering if anyone has any advice on making long distance work? She’s already told me she’s bad with her phone, which I’ve known she is so is there anything I can do to get my mind of her replying maybe? 

TLDR; 3 months into long distance gf barely replies to me. Told her how I feel, she basically says that’s just how she is",z11oqq,7,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z11oqq/gf_27f_barely_talks_to_me_26m_3_months_in_to_our/,relationships
319,Me (F29) and my gf (F29) been together for two years. Recently we started working on our communication more but I can’t vocalize my needs.,"I noticed that during our more serious talks about improving I’m not comfortable with her tone as she sounds like she’s skeptical or she doesn’t care. 

Now… In our past I wasn’t the most “trustworthy” partner as when I promised doing something and didn’t do it or just straight up broke the promise. Shitty, I know, but we’re slowly working on it. 

Anyway, I mentioned to her that I didn’t like her tone and she kindly asked me how she could change it or what to say instead of just a dry “ok/alright” to my promising I’ll improve. Here’s the thing… I have no clue?? What’s more, me not knowing what my needs are or how to communicate how I feel to her happens so frequently that it’s another issue. 
Sometimes she gives me time to think my feelings through (like a few days), but it still doesn’t help. I often say “I don’t know” when she asks me how I feel about a thing or an issue going on between us.

Does anyone have been in a similar situation or have any suggestions how to tell my girlfriend what she could do instead in these situations???

320,How do I (19M) get over my gfs(19F) inability to finish?,"I am a mentally broken person. I understand I’m at a point right now where I need therapy and have had arrangements for such.

 Something that really bugs me a lot is that my girlfriend of two years has never finished with me. She has told me that is due to past trauma with a terrible terrible ex but there is a part of my brain that eats at me every second of every day telling me that if she was with someone else maybe she’d have that opportunity. It hurts me to much not to be able to deliver to her the best part of sex and makes me feel like if I was bigger or if she was with someone else maybe she’d actually be able to do it.

Before others ask I understand PiV is not a common way for women to finish but she is uncomfortable with other forms of sex due to her past trauma and I respect every boundary she sets. she tells me over and over again it’s not my fault but I can’t help but worry that it really is since she has no other experiences to compare it to.

Is there anyway I can overcome this in my head or am I doomed to forever hate myself sexually while I am in this relationship?

My girlfriend can’t finish due to personal trauma and it makes me feel like a lesser man because of it. I don’t blame her at all but I feel like I am useless sexually.",z1iujx,0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z1iujx/how_do_i_19m_get_over_my_gfs19f_inability_to/,relationships
321,Not sure if I (31F) feel enough in love with my BF (33M),"I was with my ex-fiance for 3 years and was blindsided when he cheated and left me for the other woman last year. I was completely shattered and didn't know I would ever date again. My friend of many years (since high school), Ben, was a great friend to me after the breakup. We started hanging out more after my breakup - all very respectful and he was very thoughtful and I appreciate him being such a good support to me after such a traumatic time.

I started to notice some romantic feelings for Ben, but didn't act on them in the short term and worked through therapy to make sure I was healthy enough to consider dating again. A little less than a year after the breakup, we mutually confessed our feelings to each other and started more officially dating. I think we are a great mutual fit for each other. I am highly goal-oriented but am not as good at relaxing, and he's a fun and relaxed person who says he likes that I inspire him to improve. He is incredibly caring and thoughtful, is selfless, and is overall a great person. We have talked about the big things to agree on and are on the same page - kids, finances, religion, communication. He also accepts feedback very well. We've been dating for about 6 months at this point, we have great sexual chemistry and the first few months were honeymoon phase great.

That being said, I've been concerned for the last couple of months that I don't feel as much as I should for a romantic relationship. I care for him a lot but I'm not sure I have deep passionate love. I don't feel anything deeply when I look at him or think about him. I don't pine, daydream, or miss him - but we do see each other for at least a day or two every weekend. My therapist asked me if I would be jealous seeing him with another woman, and I don't think I really would. But this could also indicate a more secure form of attachment if those feelings in the past were based on anxious attachment / anxiety. Some of his habits/behaviors have already started to really irritate me when we hang out together which seems too soon, i.e. not controlling his dog better, not making healthier choices, and as dumb and shallow as it sounds, noises - he makes goofy pained noises multiple times when he moves and it's just starting to get on my nerves. He's also floated living together soon, and I've been enjoying living alone so much, I'm not sure I'm ready for that - which I've told him. I'm torn up about feeling like this - makes me feel really sad because I really wanted this to work out and saw potential here.

I'm trying to figure out if this is a dating-a-friend issue - like I knew him so well that we have already progressed into more companionate love? I'm worried I'm not appreciating how great of a partner he is for silly reasons. Or if it's a post honeymoon phase, which I know goes away with time, but I've never felt so flat at this phase in the relationship. I welcome any questions that people think could help me gain some clarity. Thanks for reading.

The problem is that she ended up following me back, but I believe the message didn’t just go to her general DM tab; most likely still in her requests.

Should I send it again so that she sees it? Or is that too much and hope for the best? I don’t want to come off as desperate.

(She lives in my country but really far) So it started 8 months ago we met in a game where she used to play with her ex. His ex was my in game friend i didn't knew he had a gf. Then we started playing together. After 1 month i stopped playing with them. I thought they doesn't play anymore. But then i came to know that mf guy broke up with her. Then me and the girl started talking on Instagram after 7 days she gave me her phone number. Then we started chatting on WhatsApp. Then we created a really good bond with each other talking everyday playing games with her etc. Then i started to develop love for her it was increasing day by day i thought i should not say it but i told her that i love her iam a really shy kind of a person in front of girls this was the first girl i truly loved. Then she told me she loved her ex sooo much she isn't in the state of loving someone again rn. She got betrayed by 2 guys both left her and leave her alone in sadness. The 2nd guy she had in her life she truly loved him. But that mf left her. Then she told me she now want to focus on her career and her family. She told me that she is afraid that the damage feels permanent. I want to do so much for her anything for her. I say love u to her almost every day she always replies with a smile. She told me feels good to be loved by me she feels comfortable around me she want me to stay with her forever but she isn't in the state of loving me rn. Although we developed sexual attraction towards each other. She loves what i do i love what she do. Although she said she never thought she would develop these types of feelings for someone again. She is so much emotionally attached with me. She said she can live without sexual things (and i know she isn't a lustful girl she values emotions first) she wants to be emotionally attached with the person first. She has a lot of family problems she is sacrificing herself for the family. We talk almost 3 hours on video call every day watch movies online together play games etc. And she loves mature guys which iam actually opposite tho. And another thing i love herr sooooo muchhh

 Now what i want to know is 1. She loves me or not or she is hiding?. 2 if we are sexually attracted towards each other then why she doesn't loves me because a person develops these feelings for whom he / she loves right. 3 what could i do to develop those feelings in her is there anyway or just give her time?

325,Anxious attachment- texting,"TL;DR - I am an anxious attachment style who is in a new, happy relationship. When away from my partner, I like to communicate often through texting; however, he is the type that is seemingly fine without that constant level of communication, where for me it makes me worry that he is uninterested. 




I am completely anxious attachment; I’ve been delving into attachment theory lately and have learned so much about myself that things that I questioned for so long finally make sense. I’m actively working on trying to overcome these issues, because I am in a new, healthy, happy relationship (I left an abusive relationship not long ago) and I don’t want to let these patterns get the best of me.

I’ve been seeing someone for a little over a month and we have a really strong, almost out of this world connection. It came unexpectedly but I am so glad we met and connect as well as we do. He is very patient, attentive, and everything I have been searching for in a partner; from what I can see so far, he is a secure attachment style. My last relationship was with a total DA, so this is refreshing for me. 

However, the one issue I run into is texting. Since we are early into the relationship, and live a solid 40 minutes  from each other/I have my kids with me for the beginning of the week, we only see each other 1-2 times a week. I’m happy with this as it give us both a balance and I don’t feel a burnout (which can happen with too much too fast, as we know), texting throughout the day is an important part of our conversations. I noticed that I am a more “in depth” texter, and like to text more often, where he can give off shorter replies/go longer in between texting me then I would like. I find that this bothers me sometimes and leads to my Catastrophic thinking that he all of a sudden isn’t interested anymore, is bored of me, etc. The logical part of my brain knows this isn’t true; we have really great conversations when we are together in the flesh, and I never for a second get a vibe like that. He often talks about future plans he wants to make with me, places he wants to take me to, has introduced me to his family, etc. which all shows me that he does care and is interested. I really don’t want to let the anxiety about texting/lack of communication throughout the day take away from any of that, as I am genuinely happy and hopeful for the first time in years.",z1hyg8,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z1hyg8/anxious_attachment_texting/,relationships
326,I (19F) have become too emotional after getting into my first ever serious relationship.,"Title^. All my life I’ve been the most rational minded person in the room. I would very rarely let emotions get the best of me and would think practically all the time. This system was probably not the best but at least it was working for me. I was much more mentally sound and wouldn’t let other people’s opinions of me affect me a lot.

I’ve always been a romantic person but I’m not a fan of hookup culture and therefore did not mess about too much and didn’t really have a deep emotional relationship with any men. The one time that I did try to develop an emotional connect I was treated with disrespect and after that I decided that I wouldn’t settle for anybody who wouldn’t treat me right- have genuine love and respect for me. I was pretty stubborn about not settling in that sense but I guess this made me overly critical of other people? This also made me want to actively stop looking for a romantic partner and just focus on building my career.

Then out of nowhere I met my current boyfriend (19M) 5 months ago and my life has not been the same since. I feel like I’ve completely changed as a person- everyone around me, including just acquaintances and people I’m not very close with- keeps commenting on how much happier I look. Which is true btw, I am so grateful to have him and love him very much. I know I’m very very young and this sounds like puppy love- and it just might be! But he genuinely makes me feel special and I appreciate him a lot.

That being said, I feel like he has unlocked this emotional side of me that I might’ve kept aside all this time? Don’t get me wrong, he’s very rarely the cause of my breakdowns. It’s just that I’ve turned into such a deeply emotional person that I feel like it’s starting to take a toll on me. It gets a bit exhausting to feel so much all the time. I find myself tearing up and crying at the smallest of things- This has never happened before and I feel like something’s wrong. These days I find myself getting upset over things that I cannot control (something I used to be good at dealing with).

Is this normal or should I be concerned? Is there a way to manage my emotions in a healthy way? Any advice is deeply appreciated!

327,I (33f) feel insecure about my relationship with my partner (33m) bc the intimacy is gone. What can I do to fix this??,"First post. I’m really struggling in my relationship. Me & my bf have been together about two years… living together for the past year. 

Our relationship was incredibly connected in the beginning. We are best friends & have so much fun together. It was such an easy transition to living together… until it wasn’t. 

For the past six-ish months, the intimacy between us is just gone. And I don’t just mean physically… even emotionally we seem to be on different planets these days. It’s been really hard to pinpoint what changed (other than us moving in together). 

Our sex life is virtually non-existent at this point, which is exacerbating my already intense fear of being cheated on/abandoned. When I ask him why he doesn’t want to do it anymore, he says he just doesn’t want to. He said he feels bored… which made me feel sad & confused bc I’m veryyyy sex positive & open and we used to have GREAT sex, but now he always shoots down my advances with an excuse about how tired he is. It’s gone on like this for months & I feel really insecure about it. In my past experiences, if my partner stopped wanting sex, it was bc they were getting it somewhere else. Obviously, my trauma brain lights up like a Christmas tree every time he says no bc of this… but also because… 

We finally had a real conversation about what’s going on & he admitted to me that he doesn’t know if he understands or even likes the idea of just having sex with one person forever. He said he hasn’t cheated on me, but he feels scared, so he thinks that’s why he’s avoiding it with me. He says it’s bc he’s never lived with someone. He says it’s bc he’s afraid of intimacy. The reasons always seem to change. 

I know how bad that all sounds (I think? I think it sounds bad?) but he also reassured me that he wants to get over all of it & be with me. That he loves me. All the things. I told him I understand his fear & that I want to work through it with him. I promised him I wouldn’t judge him for those feelings & I meant it…. I didn’t get angry, I just calmly accepted it. He cried. I cried. We agreed to do the work together. We’ve even been in couples counseling for a few months. It’s a slow process. 

The problem is, even though I’ve been super understanding, I still feel really  insecure about our relationship right now. I know it’s a combination of the things I’ve been through in my past & the things I’m hearing from him, but it’s really hard to trust him when we are so disconnected. I’m constantly wondering if he’s getting it somewhere else & it’s taking a huge hit on my self-esteem. I feel really vulnerable & scared most of the time. I guess bc of all these feelings, I’ve been asking him a lot lately if he loves me. I can’t help it, I just constantly wonder whether he even wants to be here or not. 

The other day he told me a story about how his ex broke up with him because he couldn’t say “I love you.” We talked about it for a bit & eventually I asked if he ever considered breaking up with her first (to me the right thing to do is let someone go if you don’t have the same feelings they do). He kinda dodged the question & said he shouldn’t have been expected to lie to her? My understanding is that this girl stayed with him anyway until eventually he cheated on her. 

This situation happened ten years ago. There is definitely plenty of evidence to suggest he’s not the same person anymore, but I just haven’t stopped thinking about it. Last night, I looked at him & just said “Please promise me that if your feelings for me change, you will break up with me. I don’t want to be where I’m not wanted & I’m really worried about it.” It was really hard for me to say that to him, but I wanted to be honest about how I’ve been feeling. 

I wish I could say he reassured me & we got to open up a dialogue about it… but that’s not what happened. He got really upset. He called me pathetic. He said he feels SAD (for me) that I can’t just believe that he loves me. He said he can’t be with someone who constantly asks him if he loves them. He wants me to apologize for hurting his feelings. He said that when I ask questions or express that I’m feeling insecure or afraid, it’s “off-putting.” He constantly says that I’m “just too much.” This went on for hours. 

I was obviously pretty argumentative back. I said it really hurt me to be called pathetic for having a fear… he responded that he’s never telling me anything ever again. He said I’m the reason he never opens up or says how he feels. He said it’s completely okay for him to call me pathetic because it’s “how he feels.”

I tried to explain that I don’t think calling someone pathetic is a feeling. Aren’t feelings like, I statements? Is saying “you’re pathetic” a feeling? Am I insane? 

He wanted me to apologize for saying I’m scared he’s going to cheat on me. He also wanted me to apologize for asking him to make a promise that he’ll be honest with me about how he feels. He said hearing that makes him feel bad. It just doesn’t sit right with me… shouldn’t I be able to say how I feel? Isn’t that better than hiding it? 

He got even more upset when I said I wasn’t going to apologize for those things. I kept trying to stick the point that it’s not okay for him to talk to me like that & he needs to find a better way to communicate how he’s feeling. He said it makes him feel sick to his stomach when I ask if he loves me & that I can’t keep “doing this to him.” I still don’t see how I am doing anything TO him?? 

He got so mad he literally put himself to bed & pulled the covers up over his head when I tried to keep talking to him. 

Now he is fast asleep. This was over an hour ago & here I am searching for answers… 

Where am I going wrong? Am I too much? Am I pathetic for having fears? 

I’m fully aware that I can be a person who has a hard time trusting people… but it feels warranted in this situation. 

I also know that all the reassurance in the world from him isn’t going to take away all my fears. 

I do, however, feel like it’s entirely fair to want my partner to understand / accept my fears. 

More importantly, it doesn’t feel particularly safe to be judged for my insecurities. How can I trust someone who thinks I’m pathetic? 

Maybe my approach is wrong? I just wanted to share how I was feeling. And really, I wanted to hear from him that he wouldn’t do the same thing to me that he did to his ex. I guess I still need the reassurance? Especially bc things feel so distant between us right now? Am I being unreasonable? 

Please, people of Reddit, what am I doing wrong here? AM I PATHETIC & NEEDY? HALP!

328,My Ex says she wants me back and that she loves me but she does off putting things.,"

Alt acc bc she follows my main.
I recently went through a breakup with my GF, we are still talking and we wanna get back together I think. She doesn't trust me because I liked some photos on Reddit. IMO they weren't bad photos but I guess it wasn't something I should've done. We both love eachother very much, at least I love her.... I just feel like she doesn't feel the same and is keeping me around for some cruel reason.

34 minutes after she left me she posted on a friend making sub saying she was looking for a BF. 34 MINUTES. This is my first reason why. She gave no reasoning besides ""I just wanna mess around"" or ""I don't actually wanna date any of them"" and everytime I bring it up it seems like a dispute breaks out and she blames me for being a bad bf.

Second reason, after we broke up she texted some of her exes who she denies having previous relationships with despite making posts with them in the past calling them BF/GF. when asked about it she just says it was a joke or simply denies it.

Third reason, she's making me compete. She tells me about all these guys she is talking to and how a majority of them are interested. I just feel like if she really loved me this wouldn't be a competition.

Now I feel bad because I feel like I painted her as a bad guy here. This is just my POV and I may have described it badly. Do not take my side or her side. She is very nice and treats me well, she calls me all the time, texts me whenever she can, stays up late for me, and tells me she loves me. I simply have my doubts. the way I worded this may have made it sound like she hates my guts, I know that is not the case.

And yes, I know I'm only 16, don't know what true love is and won't till I'm older yada yada yada, I've heard the same speel from every adult I talk to. I don't care if it is or isn't true love, this is how I feel.

I like her a lot but feel like if she really felt the same she wouldn't do this to me. It's hurtful and bad for my mental health, I just want to see more mature people's thoughts on it.

TL;DR 
My Ex wants me back but I have my doubts for 3 reasons
A. She tried to replace me 34 minutes after we broke up
B. She started talking to her exes after we broke up
C. She is making me compete against other guys
BUT I know she treats me nicely besides all of this, I don't feel like going indepth here but she treats me well.

329,I broke up with someone due to my mental health and I feel terrible.,"Me (M20) and someone (F20) started dating about 3 weeks ago. Things were initially going fine - she seemed incredibly simmilar to me, and I was infatuated with her. But things started to get ugly - we both have mental issues - I'm depressed, and she is  bipolar. Her lifestyle, lacking any order, started to affect me. I became convinced that I can't handle her, considering my health. We are both from abroad and studying, I felt that I'm not meeting friends, not studying properly, and that the happy bubble I made for myself was a lie. She was manic and would talk endlessly several times a day, leaving me no space. Once she got drunk and got home to my place, and then woke me up several times despite me being clear about needing to get a proper rest this day. I also struggled to show positive emotions because of the depression. Myself, I am functional but I struggle to have fun and be social. She was very different in that.

 After two days passed and I abruptly broke up, though politely, she was devastated. I now feel incredibly bad about it. I was the one to initiate the relationship in the first place, while she didn't initially want it to get serious. Then I bailed. Yes the sex and evenings together were nice, but I started to notice my other areas of life becoming neglected. I don't know whether I wouldn't be able to take care of them and be in this relationship, and I keep thinking whether we could have actually had something healthy, set the boundaries. It's likely we couldn't considering how much severe her issues were, but I'm not a saint either. I keep thinking whether it would be better to be miserable together rather than separately, but now it's too late. After the break up she told me she just wanted to be together no matter what, which was terrible again because I felt like I could have tried to work through it first. Maybe these were only several weeks and it's best to just leave and not to prolong any pain for anyone, or maybe it was something special what won't come back. Maybe I'm more stable now but we were starting to make plans for the future, plans I won't be able to experience.I don't know whether I did the right thing. My friends tell me that yes, especially after how strongly she freaked out after I broke up. But I'm not sure if it just wasn't justified. If you are meeting someone and then break up out of the blue, normal people freak out too.

Tl;dr Me and my ex both had mental issues (her being much less stable) and I started to become destibilised too. We were having a good time as lovers, but I started to neglect my life and didn't feel happy. I abruptly broke up, broke her heart, and now have doubts whether I did the wrong thing.",z18ji2,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z18ji2/i_broke_up_with_someone_due_to_my_mental_health/,relationships

331,"My [24f] boyfriend [24m] of one year is pulling away/ being distant, how do I handle this situation","

we’ve been in a weird place for the last month. He started suddenly being cold and distant with me halloween weekend, not looking me in the eye and pulling away when I held his hand, and just being sort of mean to me. 

We are long distance rn and have been for the last 6 months and I was visiting him halloween weekend. 

It took me multiple times asking him to tell me what’s going on with him. 

Initially he said he’s unsure of our relationship, and what he wants. Upon further discussion, which was really me begging him to communicate, said he feels unwell mentally and he feels he’s losing himself. He feels off in general and needs to start therapy. He asked me for space as he feels he needs to solve this alone.

 It blindsided me as he gave me no indication that this is how he was feeling, as he said he’s been feeling this way on and off for two months. And the last time we met which was two months ago we were both very happy. I asked him if I or our relationship is the reason he is feeling this way. He said no. 

I ask him if he wants to continue our relationship he says yes with space.

I understand how serious mental health is so I agreed to give him space. I apologized if I had any part in making him feel unwell. And I told him I’m here for him . 

Ten days after I return home he hasn’t reached out to me at all. I text him asking if he’s well after his mom texts me asking if I’d heard from him. He calls me a days later, saying he needs more time and apologizing. I tell him don’t apologize take care yourself I’m gonna be here for you. 

12 days pass and I hear nothing from him. I sent him a care package, and he’s supposed to come for thanksgiving so I text him on day 11  he doesn’t reply. Worried, I call him on day 12. He answers saying he’s on the phone with his friends and he’ll call me back. 

He calls me back 4 hours later, he says it’s not a good idea for him to come for thanksgiving. I tell him I understand. I ask him how he is. 

He says he needs to be alone to figure it out. I say ok and I’m here for him and ask him how hefeels about us. He says ‘I don’t know’. I ask him what he means as he said the same thing Halloween weekend. He says ‘idk’

I tell him ok, his mental health is the priority and he should focus on that and we can talk about our relationship after he feels okay again. He says I don’t want to ‘drag you down’ bc what if when I feel better I won’t want to be with you.

I ask why he would say that, does he think he’ll feel better if we break up? He says no. I said why wouldn’t you want to be with me when youre better, if when you were feeling normal before, you wanted to be with me. He says ‘I don’t know’ 

I tell him I’m committed to this relationship, and when the time comes he has to decide wether he is or not, and I tell him I don’t know if he is in a place where he can decide that now. 

He says he loves me but he doesn’t know if he can do this. I tell him I don’t understand what changed or why he feels this way. He says ‘I don’t know’. And I ask him again if he feels that he would be better off if we broke up and he said no. 

I tell him we can check in every Sunday if that’s okay with him, until he feels mentally okay again. He says ok. I tell him we can get through this and we’re gonna be okay. He says okay I trust you. I tell him I love you he says it back. 

What do you guys think? 
 
should I continue to support him.
My sister said it seem like he just trying to detach himself from me slowly until he’s ready to actually break up with me 
He’s giving me zero insight as to what he’s thinking at this point.  

The part where he’s like, what if when I’m better I don’t wanna be with you is really throwing me off 

I know mental health is tricky but I also need an outsiders perspective on the situation because I can’t seem to understand what is going on at this point

332,We decided to stay friends once she leaves. Is there hope for us in the future?,"I’m 28M and she’s 23F. I met her while she was an exchange student at my university for a semester. We have both admitted that although we have very strong feelings for each other and the chemistry is very strong, that it’s not very wise to pursue an LDR at the moment while we both finish our degrees once she leaves. However, we agreed to stay friends, talk often and what happens will happen. We even agreed that if we are physically together at the same place, we could start dating again. I plan to visit her once she leaves for around 10 days in her country, and I plan to study abroad for a semester there as well next year. We truly love each other’s company and we have both said that it would be great if we worked out in the future. However, is this realistic? LDR is not the move for us right now. It would be impractical to talk everyday and have “relationship” expectations while we are apart. However, I would like to see a future with her. Is this realistic? We agreed that if our feelings don’t change for each other as we stay long distance friends and we are both single, we can continue dating once we are together again. She seems to be everything I look for in a partner and I would like to think there’s a future, even if we won’t be in a relationship while apart. Am I being realistic or an LDR is needed for this to work in the long run? I guess I am scared that the distance will make us lose that romantic attraction for each other. Any advice/stories are appreciated! Thank you!

333,bf went on dates with ex-wife's friend,"




I looked on my bf's phone (with his permission) and found out that one of the girls he is still friends with on social media is his ex-wife's close friend. At first I didn't think much about it but then checked their conversation and found out that 6 month after divorce he went on a few dates with her and talked a lot. I feel really weird now like I can't introduce him to any of my girlfriends. I just think if I did something like that to my ex I would be a jerk. I used to dislike my bf'ex-wife( he complains how she used him) but now I feel bad for her
How would you react to this? I'm thinking of trying to forget I saw that because it's between him and his ex however I will request to never get in contact with this girl again because she is clearly has low morality and I don't want someone like that around us. They don't talk much but he did send her money and talked to her after meeting me a couple times ( before we were serious but already exclusive)

334,"Celibate relationship, is it worth it? (ghsv-2)","TL;DR: 
My boyfriend doesn’t want to have sex with me because I have herpes. We are in a celibate relationship. Is this worth it?


My boyfriend and I are in a “celibate” relationship because I have ghsv-2 and he doesn’t want to get it. I still give him head and he doesn’t like giving head.

We’ve been together for 3 months and we’ve only had sex once (the first time we met). That time I stopped him when he started and disclosed. He forgave me but of course he didn’t want to have sex anymore. We continued dating. He told me he enjoys head but doesn’t want to have sex without being long term and doesn’t want to risk getting herpes. I don’t particularly like giving head but I still do it, maybe because I feel guilty for not disclosing earlier. 

A lot of my self worth used to come from sex. I’ve had herpes for a year now. My bf jokes around about us having sex but I’m not supposed to expect it at all. I know that his goal is not to be long term with me, and it’s because my body count is in the 20s and I have herpes, and his cultural values clash with my past sex life. I’m trying to be better but I can’t change my past.

Additional info: I’m on valtrex and lysine. I hit 13 months since I was diagnosed, so I’m in the range of having very infrequent outbreaks. Also, he has told me he doesn’t mind me having herpes but he just doesn’t want to get it (to clarify). And yes I didn’t disclose earlier, but what can I do about it now. He has never done an std panel. We would go on dates often where he would pay for me like bowling golfing etc. Not sure if that changes anything but it’s not like I just meet him and give him head.

Additional info 2: I probably poorly phrased the post. For the expectation, I would initially ask if he wants to have sex and he would give me a long message that he wants to be in a long term relationship so he knows the risk is worth it. Genuinely, I think he is sexually attracted to me but scared of getting herpes even after saying “it’s no big deal”. I asked him recently if he sees us as long term, and his answer is “I don’t know”.

335,Sex life with partner changed recently (past 3 months),"My (f22) boyfriend (m24) and I have been together for 3 years. We basically lived together for our entire relationship but officially moved into a house he bought in February of this year. Since we moved in together our sex lives went from 2 times a week to about once every 2 weeks. I know he's under stress be of recent job changes and also the responsibility of now owning a home. All I see is people posting about having sex multiple times a week to have a healthy relationship and I just don't know how honest and realistic this is. We're both pretty young so I feel like maybe I should be working to improve this. I talked with him about it and he says he's just not in the mood as often and that there's no reason for it other than that. I asked him if he was depressed or if somethings wrong he said he didn’t know and that he didn’t think anything was wrong in the relationship. He used to be the one persuing more often than I was so now it feels weird to be in the position where I'm wanting more and he's not.

336,My (M26) gf (F26) has had a tough year/life and is increasingly pessimistic and stressed. I don't know what to do.,"So my partner and I, like many young adults in our country, has had a really fractured and difficult time since the pandemic. She actually arrived here from overseas in March 2020, got stuck, and decided to stay. We've been dating since mid-2021. Before she came here, she'd just graduated from art school, which is obviously a tough industry to do well in, but I do think she's a wonderful artist and could potentially succeed in that work. Since being here, she's got by on a few low-paid casual jobs, and has very little savings. She's also had really big challenges with health issues, which have really broke her spirits, and which are still yet to be resolved. She can't afford to see a psychologist, but there's a lot she's struggling with mentally: traumatic childhood, recovering from sexual violence, potentially undiagnosed autism, and maybe now depression and anxiety too. Long story short, she's had a really difficult time in her life, and it doesn't look like changing much in the near future. 

At present, I am kind of going through the opposite of this. Life is just great! I love her so much and we really do have wonderful times together. Career-wise, I have never had a better year and I'm very optimistic and ambitious about what I want to do in the future. I'm also on a comfortable income, and have received some generous financial support from my grandparents. Although I lent my girlfriend a decent sum of money last year while she had to take time off work to recover from a surgery, as a very independent person and committed feminist, she understandably hated being indebted to me. While she has paid me back this money now, there is no way she would accept further financial support. I have occasionally given her money to help with her medical bills. I've also offered her money to see a psychologist, but she doesn't want to take this offer up. I've also offered her money to support her to paint and then sell these works, but again, she does not want to be indebted to me, even though I wouldn't ask for the money back if she didn't find success.

When we first met, I was very attracted by her ambitiousness. She had many dreams about what she wanted to do in her career, but now that she is really struggling, she's lost a lot of that drive. Despite not trying to be an artist here, or work in the art industry, or something else related to other interests of hers, she has now said that she cannot have a career in this country. (She does not have a desire to return to her country of origin, but I have said I would be willing to move somewhere else with her, even though that is not my preference). 

For the time being, she is now considering accepting a job in a notoriously low-paying field. It is attractive to her because it is steady income with reliable hours. In the short to medium term I think this is a perfectly good job for her, but I'm more off-put by her nihilism about having a career in this country. 

I empathise and want to support her, but the 
ambitious woman I fell in love with has been crippled by her really challenging life circumstances. I don't know what to do. I want to support her, but I am increasingly put off by who she is becoming -- even if this is obviously the product of a really awful time she's having. Likewise, I am put off by her pessimism about her career prospects, but I also don't want to be domineering over what she does for her career. And similarly, I want to support her financially and have the means to do so, but I completely respect her desire to not accept this. I just don't know what to do now.

337,My best friends are making feel like shit but I don't want to leave them,"TL:DR both my best friends treat me like I was disposable and make feel like shit a lot of times, but we've also had a lot of good moments and I don't know what to do.

I (F16) have two best friends: Anne (F16) and Isaac (M16), and we've been together since we were 7 or 8 and we were happy and fun. The thing is that during the last two years I've started to feel horrible around them. And I will explain some of the reasons why.

They keep A LOT secrets from me, and while I wouldn't mind that much if they fucking well kept them from me, they talk about those secrets when we're together and when I ask about what they're talking about they blatantly say that I can't know about that. And you may think, maybe they have some problem at home or something, maybe, but if they had some of those they know that they could talk with me because I've been physically and mentally abused by my father until my parents divorced. They know I can fucking help. 

So one day during this May, I angrily finally asked what the fuck were they talking about with those secrets behind me. And the answer? Anne had a crush on guy since last August and they were ""flirting"" (if that can be called flirt bc I didn't see a shit) and Isaac had a also a crush on one of my close friends, Sara. And they kept that stupid secret for a year, and didn't tell me nothing, why? Because they explicitly said ""it's not your business"". I mean, I thought you said I was your best friend.

It is very important to say that Anne and Isaac also have a very strange dynamic between them. Isaac almost completely obeys what Anne says, and if you say something about how strange that is, he says ""that's how it is"". To the point they even act like some kind of couple, heck, I've seen them from my balcony cuddling like a couple. And it's strange, to the point that they look like a super cheesy couple or something. They even tell other people they're cousins (they're both latino in a white country) so people don't ask them if they're a couple.

Anne and Isaac also like to come to my house, especially Anne. When we're watching a movie in the living room she gets up and says I'm tired and then goes to sleep to my room or interrupts because she wants to go out or something that clearly nobody else wants, breaking the mood for everyone. Every. Fucking. Time.

They also talk very secretly between them in my house.

They also plan to go out a lot of times without me, but they mention it to me just before they meet, and when I ask why they didn't tell me before they say ""we forgot"". It pains yk, just be honest and say you didn't want me there already.

During this August my family and the best friends of my sibilings and I decided to go to the beach by train, since we were quite a lot. My sibilings were happy with their friends, but Anne and Isaac almost didn't talk to me in the beach. They were constantly leaving me alone. I wasn't happy, I almost wanted to cry because everybody was having fun except me. Even the mom of one of my youngest sibiling's friends asked me why I was still with them. And I was very ashamed to tell her that this wasn't the first time.

I started to go out less with them.

And the thing that was the final straw for me, was like a week or two ago. They complained that we weren't going out as much as before (apart of me not wanting to, I had a lot of exams too) so I asked them if they wanted to go out while helping me buy a jacket, and they accepted.

While we were on our way to the shopping centre they started playing like kids while I was behind as always and then they started fighting of some stupidity regarding the crush of Anne and causing a scene in a public park. And this wasn't the first that happened. I always stood there waiting (they could stay 20 min or more discussing in the same place) dying of embarrassment and they didn't ever think about me. 

So this time I was just tired of their fights and went to some bench in front of them to rest and wait for more than 30 min. I think I must mention that I was with earphones and distracted with my phone, but I did make clear where I was going (and I was in front of them). 

When I raised my eyes to look what they were doing, they were gone. I searched throughout all the zone and didn't find them. I tried to call and text and they didn't respond. Finally, after 20 min, they sended a message telling me that they went back to their houses because Anne felt very tired. She fucking wasn't. If she had the energy to embarrass herself in a park, and we all knew that was a lie. She just didn't want to be with me probably

They treat me like if I was disposable. I'm the third wheel of the group.

I naturally felt betrayed, because, you don't usually abandon your friend in a park alone without saying nothing. At least a text message or something. It was embarrassing. And it wasn't until 12 am that I received a message from Isaac apologising. I told him I was okay because I was tired and I didn't want to spend energy on him, but I couldn't accept it in my heart. Oh, and Anne hasn't said anything about that. Because I didn't mention it when we met again she thinks I've forgotten it or something but I haven't. 

Since then, I don’t really want to be with them. I feel fake or something.

And I feel uncomfortable now around them. But I can't stop being friends with them. We've shared a lot of good memories and laughs, and I will miss them a lot. They're my closest friends. And I see them everyday because we live in the same neighbourhood and go to the same school. I still want to be with them.

And I don't know what to exactly do. Should I just stop going out with them? Or should I try something else?

338,I female (29) don't know what to do about my fiance (male 28)," 

A couple of days ago I posted a question about my fiance and our silly argument. TLDR: we were at the movies and at the end, I felt that he was interrupting me and pointed it out and he got extremely upset and told me not to talk to him that way. pretty much he told me I ruined his night.

Later, the following day he sat me down and said that he thinks that we are a bad couple but he wants to work things out and try to better our relationship by spending more time together. Which is great! But I also wanted to know what I can do to make things better. Because honestly besides the stupid arguments that IMO doesn't happen too often I was happy. Now I'm just confused. Earlier today I sent him a message and asked what I do that irritates him so that way I can work to being less annoying I guess but his answer was literally ""look inward"". that he can't answer that question for me. Which is super confusing, How are you going to be mad at someone and then not tell them? How am I supposed to be a better person without being told how I am bad? He wants me to be better but I didn't know what I was being a good person. Idk what to do. I'm lost.

TLDR My fiance wants to work things out so that we argue less but won't tell me what I do that irritates him so that way I can see the signs and avoid the arguments.",z19p9m,2,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z19p9m/i_female_29_dont_know_what_to_do_about_my_fiance/,relationships
339,"I lost feelings for my crush the moment he became my boyfriend, even though he's a perfect person.","So i have this problem. I'm 19 and have been dating my boyfriend for 3 months, but we have been friends for over 6 years and during this time I had a crush on him several times. It's my first relationship ever.

At the beginning of our relationship it was exciting - I had to sneak into his house secretly, he would come pick me up from work, we watched movies together, we kissed in his car. I've never done such things in my life. But for a month and a half (if not longer) I realized I'm loosing my feelings for him and I begin to doubt if I have ever loved him. Don't get me wrong, he is the sweetest partner I could ever imagine, but every time he asks me if I love him, I feel like a cheat. His sweet, caring messages about how he loves me and misses me (it's a long-distance relationship, we see each other on weekends) makes my stomach ache because I can't return it anymore.

I feel like the villain of this story. I'm starting to ghost him. The more often he asks why I don't write back to him as often as before (and he does it several times a day), the more I feel cold and the more I feel the need to push him away from me.

I know what you're gonna say next. The honeymoon is over and I should work on my relationship. Except I don't know if the spark has ever been for me since we started our relationship.

The first time we kissed, all I thought was ""and that's it? Shouldn't I be feeling anything now?"" It was the same every time he sent me some nsfw photos of himself. He admired my body, asked for photos of me and said my photos made him feel comfortable. When he was sending me his photos, I said the same. I was pretending because I wanted him to be happy. Besides, I thought I would ""feel it"" eventually, too. A week ago my boyfriend noticed that something was wrong with me. I wanted to make it up to him, so I offered to try something more intimate. He was stressed out and and excited and then amazed when I made him feel good. I felt nothing again. And I lied that it was fine. Again.

Even though this relationship was very comfortable for me, I had a great time and our meetings felt fresh and exciting, I don't think I was really sexually attracted to him. I did what other couples do because I thought it was right and waited for this ""spark"" to come. But it didn't.

I have no idea what to do. My boyfriend is still the sweetest person in the world and does everything right. I just can't feel anything. And I don't want to confront him because he feels very badly mentally at the moment.

I just don't know what to do.

340,Feeling immense guilt over breakup decision,"Hello everyone, so I (22m) have decided to end my relationship with my fiancee (23F), the reason is that I am starting to have my own fears, after our engagement whenever we have different point of views my fiancee always snaps at me and becomes disrespectful, which to me is very stressful that I started to feel intimidated by conflicts.


All I could ever think of is that I am really scared to make a mistake because when it's just even a different point of view about something, she snaps, how about if God forbid I made a mistake? And I am a human I make mistakes.


After our last fight she kept apologizing and crying and I get so pissed off that she knew I was thinking about breakup, however I didn't say anything since she is having important exams.


I feel guilt because she cried a lot over what happened, she kept telling me that she has got nobody but me, but I don't know if this is a sustainable life, I don't know what should I do, am I a bad person? Am I overreacting to a fight? I really always stressed on how important respect and communication are. She said she will make it right next time but she already said this in our last fight a month ago.

341,Love does not conquer all apparently M (51) F (43),"For the past 5 years I worked closely with a woman being secretly in love for 4 of them. I had a strict no dating coworkers policy. The day she told me she was taking another job I decided to take a chance and asked her out. We quickly fell in love. She knew my heart as I knew hers..... or so I thought anyway.  I have never been so happy to put the most effort I've ever put into a relationship. Making moments just for her as often as I could. Reminding her of how beautiful she is when that's not who she sees in the mirror let alone never made to feel that way by a man before. Just being around her made me feel like my soul was getting recharged. The chemistry we shared was just amazing. We shared all of our deepest darkest secrets and fears. She would hug me forever because it was the first time she ever felt safe in this world. I happily held on as long as she needed. I had been single almost 8 years and it finally felt like everything was finally going to be alright for me.

I  suspected we had some differing opinions on worldly matters but it never mattered ""at work"". One day ..... what seemed like out of nowhere she made a pretty nasty comment that exposed something new. I learned that she has some pretty staunch leanings. Considering I'm a heart centric man, a man with opinions not an opinionated man that is much more interested in having ""conversations"" rather than ""talking"". I enjoy hearing different views and she certainly had them. She opened my eyes to a lot of new things I hadn't considered. Helped me understand things I struggled with. I'm also 51, don't feel the need to be the smartest person in the room anymore or have to win a fight let alone prove myself. Unfortunately that respect was rarely reciprocated and if we had any difference in opinion, (perspective - I would always start with ""I dunno I guess I've always felt like"") and she would change before my very eyes into someone I wouldn't recognize. A very toxic person spewing vitriol. Usually after the fact she would apologize for the way she reacted and would thank me for being so calm and appreciated the amount of thought I put into things. I never once got mad at her, I'm an uber tolerant dude but I'm not going to lie it certainly did hurt my feelings a bit. I've been anything but kind and respectful to her so why treat me like this? I'm a firm believer in forgiveness ... and it was always gladly and freely given to her. Love .... ya know?

At month 5 - After several visits to ""anger city"" I started to question the viability of our relationship. I imagine she had thought this several times by now because she made the comment several times ""We really are different"" in which I always replied, ""Yes, yes we are and that's OK!"". Her angry outbursts towards me if I offered an opinion that differed from hers were becoming much more frequent and started to bother me. I knew in my heart this would be like pulling the pin on a live grenade with only one outcome but it was time to talk about the elephant in the room. I could no longer handle being treated like this. We talked. I calmly and politely told her I am always feeling like I had to say words in my head three times before they left my lips. Walking on egg shells because it sure felt like she was offended by darned near everything and I was struggling to simply communicate with her on most levels. I saw the look on her face, it was that of anger, a long pause and then she cried admitting she had no idea she was acting like that and apologized. She said she never meant to be that way and never wanted me to feel like that. I told her it was ok, that I believed her and there was nothing to forgive because I wasn't angry. I just wanted her to know I was bothered by something and was expressing it. After all, the very things she claimed to hate about her ex husband was exactly how she was treating me. I then told her that she needed to figure out what truly matters to her, said I love you and as I was walking away I heard her say ""I love you too"". After she left I sent her a lengthy text message listing reasons why we should work for this. Why? Well, she runs from everything when she feels she's not good at it or embarrassed. I wanted to ensure she was OK . The next day she messaged me and told me what a great guy I am and how sweet I've been to her but ....... we need to let this go because we see the world too differently. She put a hole in me without even pulling a trigger. Or maybe it was a self inflicted wound, I pulled the pin after all.

I'm genuinely and truly sad about this. She chose an ideology over an amazing love story. Is that the world we live in now? This is my letter to throw into the campfire to let it go as it were. I do love her still and I wish her the absolute best. 

Acknowledge, apologize, promise to do better. Forgive.

342,How do find red flags in myself?,"Hi, so I will just quickly introduce myself here, I will be a 20 year old man in a three months. I have quite a lot of friends that I will talk to from time to time and a close circle of friends that I hangout quite a lot. I'm not socially awkward and I have no problems with talking to women (unless I'm really attracted to them, then I'm getting kind of nervous but I guess it's normal for men). I'm taking care of myself. Some people say that I'm funny (I mean from time to time I can quickly think of a funny joke to say) and from what I've heard they enjoy my company.

Through all my life I've asked out 6 girls, and all tries of asking out ended up in exactly the same way.

1. I ask out a girl
2. She tells me that she's interested in someone else
3. She gets a boyfriend in a week or so after I've asked her out

Besides feeling like I'm some kind of loop, and feeling from time to time hopeless and thinking that every future girl that I will ask out will say the exact same thing I'm okay. Life goes on and I enjoy my time with friends.

What's important to this story is that no girl has ever been interested in me in romantical way. Through all my life I met a lot of girls and I got a chance to ""present (?idk if it's the right word)"" myself to them so It's not like I had no chance to talk to women and I'm some kind of undiscovered gem.

I had some time yesterday and today in which I had a chance to ponder why I don't have a girlfriend. My first thought was that well all those girls I've asked out were interested in someone else so it's only natural that they didn't want to go out with me and maybe if they weren't interested in them they'd give me a chance, but on the other hand through all my life I met a lot of women, and I had to chance to talk to them and nothing happened besides having friendly relationships. I've never been asked out or I've never heard that some girl was interested in me. 

So I've concluded that maybe I'm just unattractive to women like in a physical sense. But then on the other hand I have some female friends (they're girlfriends of my friends) that told me that I'm cute or handsome on numerous occasions and they were saying like they meant it. Also I'm unable to objectively tell If i'm good looking or not but for sure I guess I can say that I'm not an ugly ass man so all i guess the argument about looks is also disproved. The only ""controversial (?)"" thing about my physical appearance is that I'm 5'6 and this might be the thing some women find unattractive but it's only natural because some women like when their partner is taller than them and it's fine. And it's not like every woman that I've met had the same preferences for height so I'd say that height isn't the problem at all.

Then I thought that maybe the problem was the environment (? idk if it's the right word, again) like maybe girls from my hometown don't like me or something because they have some prejudices towards me or something like that but I've started uni 2 months ago or so and yeah despite getting new cool friends nothing really changed in romantic sense so again it's not that.

Then there were some other thoughts like in example about personal hygiene but then the same thing I could just disprove that in my head because well I'm taking good care of myself.

So basically I was just arguing with myself and finding arguments why I don't have a girlfriend but I couldn't really find a logical one.

**And don't get me wrong - I don't think I am perfect and I'm whining here about women that they don't see the beautiful hidden gem I am.**

I know that It must be something to do with me, because well I've met quite a share lot of women and it's not like they're all wrong and they don't see how good of a man I am.

But I have no idea how to find my red flags or anything that is that a ""dealbreaker""because they might be just a natural thing for me or something like that. 

Because well If i was unsociable the solution would be pretty simple - go out talk to people etc. If i had no friends the solution would be also easier to find. And as I've explained in my introduction those ""simple"" things are not the problem and it must be something more complicated.

Also I feel like I'm running out of time to find a girlfriend. I mean sure I'm almost 20 so I''m young etc. But I feel like I should have at least some romantic experience so far at this age but sadly I have none.

Yeah so this is the end of this post, also english is my 2nd language so I might have done some grammar or spelling mistakes. If anything is unclear don't hesitate to ask because I will reply. It took me quite a while to write it all down so it might be messy so yeah some things might happen to be unclear. (also if you find something really controversial be sure to ask if it's really what I mean because I'm afraid that I've put something into stronger words than I should have or something like that)

***TL;DR I think that women don't approach me because I have some kind of a red flag, but i'm not able to find it myself or i don't know a way on how to do it and also i don't think the advice is as simple as ""go out"" ""be nicer"".***

343,What should I do?,"My boyfriend M(20) and I F(19) have been together for almost a year, but I have a problem, he follows a bunch of fitness and instagram models, I told him that that I’m not ok with that but I never took it too serious, today I was checking his phone gallery cause I need some pictures that he took and I found a lot of screenshots of instagram models, so here goes the problem he criticises me a lot about a lot of stuff but mainly about my body, I always let it passes since I noticed that it’s kind of normal in his culture and also because I told him a lot of times already that I don’t like it and he says he does it to motivate me. So what with the screenshots? All the screenshots are from girls doing or looking exactly how he tells me he want me to look and doing stuff that he insists that I do. For example: he told me I should do more felixibility exercise (he has a lot of pictures of girls doing splits), he says he wants that I go to twerk classes (he has videos of girls doing that). I’m too young to be his fantasy pleaser but I don’t know how to make him understand that.

345,My [24F] boyfriend [29M] made no effort on my birthday,"For context, my boyfriend and I had been talking about going on a day or weekend trip to Nashville for a few months now but things kept coming up. 

My birthday was approaching and our relationship was more down than up. The day before my birthday we were doing good, but he didn’t mention anything about my birthday so I asked him if he know what tomorrow was. He said yes.

The next day he woke me up saying happy birthday! But then he went back to his things and asked me what I wanted to do. We ended up getting some tacos and then running some of his errands. Later my sister asked if I wanted to do anything for my birthday so we went over to her place and we ordered takeout and played some games. It was a small get together with her, her fiancé, me and my boyfriend. My sister paid for our food. At around 10pm, he got tired and wanted to leave so we left and he dropped me off at my apartment. 

I was upset that it didn’t even seem like he wanted to stay over and felt too tired to even try to spend more time with me on my birthday. Also, he didn’t plan anything or really do anything outside of saying happy birthday in the morning. Gifts aren’t a big deal to me, but over the past 2 years we did exchange gifts. He didn’t even say anything about not having a gift.

Afterwards I got a mystery gift and I asked him if it was from him, it wasn’t. Then I told him how disappointed I was in this birthday and he started saying that we were going to go to nashville this weekend and he was going to take me there for my birthday but because we had a fight it was too awkward to plan. Even though we never made concrete plans about going to Nashville.

I think it’s an excuse because he could’ve brought it up the day before my birthday after we were fine, or even the day of my birthday. Just saying something to give me a heads up that he didn’t get to planning or that he wanted to but felt weird about it would’ve been enough. But the fact that he waited until after I was upset to tell me that he originally wanted to take e there for my birthday is really upsetting me. 

Honestly if he just confessed that he messed up and forgot or was mad and didn’t want to, that would be fine. But I hate the excuses! Saying that he would’ve done all of this but because of our fight he didn’t. And he never brought it up before I said anything so it seems like he would’ve been fine with his efforts on my birthday if I didn’t bring it up.

So, Reddit…what should I do? I think I’m mostly upset with his “excuses” more than anything.

347,"M26, SO 35F. How to move forward?"," Hey! I could really use some advice here.

My SO is amazing in many ways. Someone i really trust, and she is loyal to a fault. Been together for 5 ish yrs.

There is however some things that bother me a bit. We have fallen into a  rut,  and have been kind of aggressive for some time now. Not only towards each other. We have both agreed that our communication is lacking, and that we need to communicate more clearly.

In   addition to this, she has a bad knee which she is very quick to blame. Dont get me wrong, i do believe her knee is bad, but it hinders us in several aspects. She does not like being on top in bed (which i would very much like from time to time), whenever i mention that we should probably get out more - maybe exercise a bit - she says she dont like the forest, and that her knee is bad etc.

She   also want to get out more, and agrees that we dont do much together. TV is often the goto, which has become a problem. She says we can go to street fairs, concerts, eat out etc. I agree that we can try to do more of these things, but i do not really like big gatherings. Uncomfortable around people, especially in crowded places (social anxiety).

Other  than that, she is kind of a workaholic, but isnt working any overtime. She just enjoys working, and hates not working. I am a bit opposite. If i could retire, i would.

Ive also had some substance abuse issues. She has not approved, and has been grounding me, in a way.

A   recent event, a very traumatic one for me, turned my entire life  upside down. I think i both cheated and was (input word i cant say  because of automod) during a single weekend trip. Dont want to get into  specifics, but this was only the tip of the  iceberg from that weekend. I  have been upfront with my SO. She seems to  have accepted it. Was  hospitalized for some time after.

We   are quite torn on where to live in our country. I feel the need to  move as soon as possible given the traumatic experience, which was the  plan  in half a year or so anyways.

From   my post this far, i understand it seems that this relationship is doomed. However, we do love each other. And honestly, she is family at   this point. She has helped me through a lot of stuff, and is very good to me in many ways. I am not sure i am good for her though. I have told   her this, and that i will be moving quite soon. If we were to give us another chance, we would need to put down 110% effort. She would most definitely be sacrificing the most (given her network and family lives   where we do now) if we were to move. I would move towards my network.

She actually seems to be willing to move with me, which i did not see coming given the situation. I am afraid on her part though. If it fails in some months, heck even after a year, she has sacrificed everything, and is stuck without any network to speak of until she can move back here again.

I have tried to have the talk, make it easy for her to end it if she wants. She says she isnt sure yet. I have also mentioned that given my current mental situation, i am unsure how long it will take me to heal. This means that any plans involving children is on ice for now.

tl;dr I have an amazing gf, i am not that amazing. She is really good to me, but given some of her minor flaws, some recent traumatic experience (for me) and some differences in where we want to live, i am not sure what i should do. Have tried to talk it out with her, but she is not great at these talks. I dont blame her, it is a weird situation, and not an easy one to address. 

So, my question is: What in the hell do i do? She is most definitely good for me, but we are incompatible in other ways. Im not even sure what i want for myself. How can i move forward?

348,Avoidant Attachment - Should I actually end it?,"I'm an 21F with likely avoidant attachment who has dated in the past with limited experience. I have a tendency already to run away when feelings are reciprocated and find flaws, & think about all the ways a relationship would make my life different. This new guy I'm seeing is someone in a school club with me. I wouldn't say we were friends before but we have quite a few mutual friends. We have great physical chemistry and he's the first one to make me comfortable and turned on in that way, even though the only time we've really done stuff is when we're both kind of tipsy. I'm fine talking with him in groups and hanging out drinking but I realized when we went on a day date that we're not very compatible one-on-one. We're both introverted so it's awkward, it feels like we have nothing to talk about most of the time, he doesn't ask about my major or interests really and when I do talk about them, it feels like talking to a wall. If I'm imagining things I'd want to do with a partner (studying, grabbing coffee, going to a park), he doesn't seem like someone I'd do them with. When I go to club meetings I find myself not really looking forward to seeing him as much as some other people. It doesn't help that his best friend (who's extroverted and goofy) and I have really good banter and talks. Do I just need more time to see if there's a spark? I'm afraid I'm being avoidant like in the past by quitting so early but I truly want to remain friends with him if this doesn't work out. I'm afraid if we introduce intimacy, it'll be worse if I realize it's not working out. I feel awful though, he's been really sweet to me, texting back pretty fast, taking me out, holding my hand, and it will seem a bit out of the blue that I'm suddenly uninterested.

349,Am I (F30) walking into more deceit from my partner (M35)?,"My partner and I started off a little rocky, which I guess is pretty normal. I was into him from pretty much when we met (Oct 2020). After about a month of casually dating, I said I had slept with someone else, because it was still early days and of course I was going on other dates. He was really upset, and so we decided to be exclusive. He was still in touch with an ex a lot and had cheated on his previous gf with this ex, so I had a hard time trusting him, and it was a little tumultuous for about 7 months.

I found out about 7 months in (May/June 2021) that he had met up with another girl for a date, and wanted to fuck her. The story from him is that he got there, realised I was more important, and didn't go through with it. Anyway, going on a date felt like enough betrayal for me, so I broke up with him.

He explained to me that he had just been unsure about me/our relationship, was lonely, down and in a bad place, but the breakup made him realise how much I meant to him, and wanted to start afresh and no lies, that he was really in it for real. So, I decided to give him a chance, and from there it really did change. Our relationship is mostly very harmonious and healthy. We moved in together.

Recently though, I came across a diary (i know, i know, its such destructive and selfish behaviour on my part and I am working on it!), I found out that he slept with someone in Feb/March 2021. I knew her name as he had texted her to see how she was when we broke up in May, and when I asked who she was, he had told me she was simply someone he had gone on a date with before we had met, which wasn't true. I found out he also slept with someone in Dec 2020 and he had met up with and kissed another girl in Jan/Feb 2021. Turned out that the date I broke up with him for was the tip of the iceberg.

He maintains that this 'beginning' part of the relationship was when these things happened, and the only time they will, that he is in a different place now, loves me v much, wants to build a life with me,  and doesn't want to lose me by doing it again. I guess sometimes I feel frustrated that I wasn't even the one that had requested exclusivity, we could have dated very slowly and not been exclusive till we were both sure. I stopped seeing other people when we made that agreement. Anyway, 2020/21 is a long time ago. Things are different, it really is a special relationship and we love each other so much.. but do people ever really change? When I feel down I am plagued by the thought that it will happen again. Is this unknowing and messiness specifically at the beginning of relationships just quite a regular thing couples go through until they are both on the same page to actually commit? Or in peoples experience does it just pave the way for it happening again and again?

Any thoughts? We talk about long term future plans together. Am I just walking into pain and lies and affairs?

350,Should I (31M) shift or give up some of my hobbies so that I can spend more time with my (31F) gf?," 

I first got into dungeons and dragons back in start of the pandemic and I quickly fell in love with it. I started creating my own sessions and hosting these sessions 2 times a month (Friday from 5pm - 7pm) and I now have a new one starting once a month on Thursday between 8pm - 10pm. I also host a comic book night on Mondays starting from 10pm - midnight. I was also involved in my brother's dungeons and dragons sessions on Sundays but I have stopped attending.

In January of this year I started dating my gf. I love her very much and we've had a great relationship thus far. I told her about the way my schedules are with the dungeons and dragons and comic book nights. She is okay with comic book night being on Mondays but she has expressed disappointment with dungeons and dragons on Fridays as she wants to have Friday night dates.

One of the members of my campaign advised me that she could no longer do dungeons and dragons on Friday and asked the group if we could switch to Saturday at 12pm - 2pm temporarily, until the end of this year. This worked with everyone except my gf has expressed that now she feels as though it is taking up a lot of our time together as we usually spend every weekend with one another. I do understand her concerns and I've told her it's only temporary and I have departed from my brother's campaign, though this doesn't do much to assuage her.

I've decided that I would shift dungeons and dragons to weekdays once we get past December. I haven't discussed this with my gf as of yet but I have discussed it one of my friends. He told me I should just give up Dungeons and Dragons up entirely and my comic book nights. He feels as though I am stretching myself too thin when I do these and I need to reserve more time out for my gf. I know my gf doesn't mind comic book night and she would be happy to have those days free again, but I don't know about giving it all up. I really enjoy writing and this has helped me tremendously but I also want to do right by my gf and give her more of my attention.

I've taken a look at the calendar and we've already agreed we will not be doing dungeons and dragons on Dec 24 or 31 leaving only Nov 26 and Dec 10 as the last sessions where we will be on Saturdays. Should I jut cancel for the rest of the year and work something out or should I stop entirely?

TL;DR I want to spend more time with my gf but I have to shift my hobbies to different days in order to do it. My friend things I should cancel all of my scheduled events and spend the time with my gf instead.",z17ccb,1,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z17ccb/should_i_31m_shift_or_give_up_some_of_my_hobbies/,relationships

352,Treating me different than his ex,"I have been with my boyfriend for three years. 

I am feeling sad and demoralized because I feel like he treats me differently (in a bad way) from his ex but I don’t know if I am being reasonable here or just hyper sensitive due to my low self esteem and trauma history (before you guys comment “work on those things/go to therapy” etc. I have, for decades but it’s something that never fully goes away). 

I would find your outsider, objective opinions and perspectives outmost helpful ??. 

For some context: He proposed to her and moved in with her after a year. She ended up leaving him after a few years and a child and he basically begged her to stay. She had a very volatile temperament, forbidding him to be friends with certain people , constantly accusing him of leering at women (he doesn’t at all - if anything he is extremely polite and nerdy), showing up at his work throwing tantrums, constantly getting into fights with people etc.

 When things ended between them he pretty much turned his life around. He used to have a drinking problem (very high functioning- still excelling at work and only drinking quietly/mostly undetected still it was alcoholism). He checked himself into a program, started meditating every day, exercising, very intentionally decided to not start dating for at least a year after the divorce etc.etc. 

At this point he has been 5 years sober and kept up the good habits. 

 The concerns: He has said many times that our relationship is much more peaceful and normal than the one with his ex. Yet, when we fight or have a disagreement, he is so easy to set super firm boundaries and insinuate we won’t work because he can’t stand drama. When I ask him why the double standard, he states it’s because he got so traumatized by conflicts with his ex that he is now hypersensitive of any signs of going there again and maybe that’s unfair to me but that’s his baggage. 

Another contrast is, him moving in and proposing to her after a year, yet after three years of us being together, saying if it was up to him we would only meet once or twice a week and there is no talk of future plans. He says he would want more but now having a child and other responsibilities it’s harder to spend a lot of time. He says if things go well he would want to get married and move in together around year 5. I am certainly no rush but it hurts that the couple of times I brought it up during our relationship he seemed evasive and dismissive. 

Another thing that hurts: During their relationship he used to post about her all the time as the “one and only love of my life” and constantly saying things like “my gorgeous girlfriend” etc. He barely ever posts anything about me and the only way he ever referred to me in any of your posts is “this girl”. Never called me beautiful or love. 

I feel so sad and demoralized and like I am just some placeholder he never loved or will love or feel excited about ever close to his ex. 

On the flipside, he keeps in constant contact with me during the day, is very kind to my kids, says “ I love you “ a lot, involves me in all his family events, Holidays, travels, writes very romantic cards to me, is invested in a good at conflict resolution and in my better moments, I do feel like he really loves me. 

The question is, I can’t decide if:

1. he is truly excited and passionate about me and only treats me differently than his ex because he has grown as a person and doesn’t want to make the same mistakes. After that experience maybe he is also more afraid of rejection and is playing it more careful. Also at the time with his ex he was drunk a lot and maybe that contrived to the passionate online declarations. (He is otherwise a little shy and reserved). I am also overly sensitive due to my own trauma (in basically all my past relationships I had this conviction that my partners loved they ex’s more than me, even though looking back I know for a fact that was not by far true).

2. All of the above said, as they say, just because you are paranoid it doesn’t mean they are not following you (meaning I could have that fear and it could also still happen to be true). I am really scared I am just a lame placeholder and he by far doesn’t have the same feelings or intentions for a long term relationship with me. I don’t want to stay and waste my time as we both deserve better and fear that I am just in denial out the fact that he feels lukewarm about me at best compared to her. 

Dear Redditor, please share your wisdom!

TLDR: My boyfriend of 3 years seemed to have been a million times more romantic and passionate about his ex wife and planned future early on and spent a lot of time with her compared to me. Scared that I am wasting my time with him and I am just a “meh” placeholder for him. On the other hand, he has gone through a period of transformation and growth during/after his divorce (been sober for five years, healthy lifestyle etc). I wonder if the difference is due to him maturing , not drinking, and being more intentional and careful with relationships.  I worry about jeopardizing a good relationship with my insecurities and abandonment issues (that’s been a pattern for me in the past) vs. being delusional and in denial and he truly feeling lukewarm about me and it’s best if I end things",z16xiz,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z16xiz/treating_me_different_than_his_ex/,relationships
353,Boyfriend (23M) and I (22F) fight fairly often and I feel confused after every one. How can we manage this without couples therapy?,"
Hey all,

So my boyfriend d and I have been together for 1 year and a half. We live together (have been living together for about 6 months now). 

We get along well when things are good. Always laughing, very affectionate with eachother and otherwise happy but we argue so much. 

I realized I start alot of petty arguments (e.g him not doing dishes when I ask) and other things but that’s come down alot since I’ve become more aware of trying to figure out what I need. 

I also have been recently diagnosed with BPD traits which cause mood swings/paranoia about him out to get me and that creates a big stress on him, but things are actively getting better while working with  therapist and psychiatrist.

The only issue is, I feel like now that I’ve learned not to get worked up in arguments, it’s hard because he also gets aggressive and reactionary and it feels like it’s pulling me in to also be reactionary. He can be very passionate and often says he feels that way when I don’t to listen to his point of view or disrespect him in some way. He says I’m stubborn and can’t listen to others opinion. I try to validate his points even if I don’t agree with them like I’ve learned but I don’t know if it works. 

I’m overall just very confused in our arguments and don’t know if I’m doing something wrong or he is. He doesn’t want to go to couples therapy and is not changing his mind about it so it’s up to me to get to therapy and work out our issues with my therapist. It makes me nervous and I wake up with anxiety because I wonder how we’ll fix these issues without couples therapy. 

Any advice?

TL;DR My boyfriend and I argue often and it gets very reactionary. I’ve been trying to engage in calmer discussions as of lately but I still feel like his passion and reaction pulls me in. I also feel confused and wonder who is in the wrong at the end of it. Couples therapy is not an option as he’s not changing his mind about it but I work through arguments with my individual therapist.

354,"How do you deal with being lied to, after they've blown the chance to be honest?","I (35F) have had a recent situation where I've been lied to by my friend (32M) of several years. I'm being vague here because they may frequent reddit.

I realized I'd been lied to, and confronted them neutrally, asking a few simple, direct questions. The same questions I had asked the night before, which were, for a lack of a better word, blatantly lied to. The same answers were given. I then told them that the morning national news makes their answer impossible.

They had the chance to remedy their answers, and after being caught, confess and share the truth. Instead, they started rambling on about irrelevant information and stuck to their story. They are recovering/struggling addict to a few drugs and I believe they left the apartment to pick up and used something as an excuse. 

So now I'm in a position to decide how to proceed. I've already confronted them and gave a chance to tell the truth, and I don't think pressing them will be helpful. It's been a couple weeks since this happened and plenty of time for them to revisit it and fess up. At this point I feel there has been a lot of damage to my trust. That someone would take my ignorance on something and use that to keep me in the dark about where they are going, and why. 

This person has also expressed the desire to move our relationship forward past friends, and this event happened on the first evening I stayed with them to visit. I feel a degree of revulsion towards them now and don't see it possible that we move forward after something like this.

So my question is, how do you handle people who are important to you who lie and do not show any sign of wanting to come clean? Looking for input on how other people handle liars in their life, how they decide to move forward from it, or not, and why.

TLDR; Friend of many years broke my trust by lying and didn't tell the truth when faced with a complete and blatant contradiction to their version of events via national news, the next morning. Looking for input on how other people handle liars in their life, as we all have them around us as friends and family, partners and children.",z1cq2m,0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z1cq2m/how_do_you_deal_with_being_lied_to_after_theyve/,relationships
355,M25 - Is my relationship towards dating and sex healthy?,"Hi! I was going to book a therapy session but figured I would start here lol. Its something I've been wrangling with for years and I still don't have a clear way of approaching this part of my life. I was really just hoping for some honest insight into what I am grappling with and how I am approaching it.

\--

I worry about how much I enjoy sex. I want to have a lot of it, I want to be good at it, and I want to do it with hot people that are also good at it. I think about sex and women non-stop. Its a motivating factor for a lot of the things I do (gym 4-5 times a week, intense skin care, etc.). A therapist would say, and I'm inclined to agree, that I derive a lot of my self worth from sex, dating, and generally being attractive to the opposite sex. This is one of the primary things I feel a lot of guilt/concern about. I know its an unhealthy fixation. I can't shake the bit of shame I feel when I think about what my body count might be. Its as though I'm cheapening myself by consistently seeking out sex with casual partners. Part of me worries I am slowly eating away at my reverence of sex or that I am harming my ability to build a strong, committed relationship down the road (which is ultimately the goal). But at the same time I enjoy it so much. Its a serious confliction, more on it in a second.

Even outside of sex, I enjoy the dance of dating and learning about someone new just as much. The build up, the release, the intensity of conversations and attraction - its all so much fun to me. Sometimes I will just go over to someone's house or have them over to mine, other times its a series of dates with no psychical intimacy until the 3rd or 4th. Either way, its the best thing ever. There are so many lovely people out there and with every new one I meet, I feel so grateful to be able to entertain these fleeting and intense experiences. I am consistently left with an new perspective and insight and genuinely feel richer for it. All that to say, it feels objectively good and additive for me in this chapter I am in. And if I am communicating and being ethical (which I am), then why do I feel so much guilt for it?  Its as though this lifestyle is directly opposed to the one I ultimately want for myself, one with kids and a wife. Should I be resisting the urge to date around and have casual partners for the sake of building something stronger and more sacred down the road?

I've come around to the idea of dating with the intent of building something with someone and fully committing, as I know I want a wife and kids. Though I worry that this approach could be problematic as it places unnecessary stress on the relationship from an early stage, I feel as though its a step in the right direction. Either way, I've been in two committed adult relationships where I saw a future with my partner, both over a year long. They both ended with me feeling stifled by the commitment and with this toxic voice in my head telling me that I could be doing better for myself. In both cases, once I ended things, it didn't take long for me to process the relationship, get over the person, and start dating again. I didn't feel any serious grief as they were relationships I wanted out of, so the predominant feeling was relief and excitement to be single again. This is something I feel fucked in the head about. I should feel a sense of loss and sadness when I part with someone whom I loved, but I don't. I cry for a day or two but then I bounce back.

Anyways, this girl I am seeing has me very excited and I genuinely see a future with her, but I worry I haven't done the emotional and psychological legwork of getting to the bottom of this fixation on sex and sexual novelty that I have. I can see myself 6 months or a year down the road with this girl, getting the old case of grass is greener syndrome and growing unhappy, as I do. The idea of casual dating and multiple partners while owning all of my free time will inevitably become too hard to resist. I recognize that a case could be made against this, saying I need to find the right person so those priorities will shift naturally, but I also see a reality where I have the right person and let them go because I wasn't able to overcome this. That's one of my biggest fears.

My other serious conflict is that I have this notion in my head that I haven't reached my potential in a lot of different ways (psychically, emotionally, spiritually, etc.). I worry about locking myself into a committed relationship when I know my ability to attract more interesting, beautiful, and exciting people is only going to increase as time goes on. I feel as though the beautiful people with beautiful lifestyles who feel unattainable to me right now could very well come within reach as I continue to grow into the shoes of the person I know I can be. I don't know if this one is unhealthy or not, but its feeling unhealthy. I think you could argue something about seeing the same potential in your partner and growing together, which is valid, but not compelling to me for some reason.

Sorry for the novel. Thank you if you made it this far.

**TL;DR:** I derive a lot of enjoyment and self worth from dating and sex. I enjoy being single a lot for this reason. I struggle when I am in a committed, monogamous relationship to fully commit when in the back of my head the grass is greener and the lifestyle of being single and owning all my time seems so much more enjoyable. I want to find a life partner and build a family, but at this point I have demonstrated a trend of the same behavior and I don't know how to break out of it. I worry this grass is always greener problem will follow me for life if I can't fix it.

**To summarize some of my questions outside of all that context:**

* Is my lifestyle when single and my approach to dating problematic?
* Is there a way to genuinely work on or solve this ""grass-is-greener"" syndrome?
* Does the emphasis I place on dating with intent (building something significant, commitment) put undue stress on my relationships in their early stages? What would be more healthy?
* Is my concern about committing before realizing more of my potential unhealthy?",z1cpqt,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z1cpqt/m25_is_my_relationship_towards_dating_and_sex/,relationships

357,PTSD is ruining my relationship,"Me (24f) and my (23m) boyfriend have been together for three years. Two years ago I was brutally assaulted by a homeless man walking home from a bar by myself. After that I couldn’t look at myself the same, my boyfriend was distant. A couple months after the attack I got blackout drunk and hit my boyfriend because I found out he cheated on me. We still ended up together. He cheated because of how miserable I was. Fast forward to today, I got drunk with my friends and ran into the girl he cheated on me with. I lost my mind and went to his house and threw his laptop at the wall putting a whole in it and breaking his laptop. I paid for him to get a new one but he refuses to speak to me. He wants to leave me but I can’t get him to understand that I need support. I feel misunderstood every day the past year and emotionally isolated. He says he loves me but I haven’t felt love since he cheated. Intimacy is sparse and he never compliments me anymore. I can’t talk about the assault, about my heartbreak, how he makes me feel because he will ignore me if I bring anything up. I feel like I’ve been bottling everything in. We are so good together despite these instances. I want to know what I can do to make things right, or make him love me again. I feel like I’ve hit a breaking point. I know I have to stop drinking which I will. I’ve never hurt him as I am very weak. But I have tried and that’s the sad part. But being sober doesn’t get rid of how I’m feeling it just is easier to hide it. I can’t afford therapy either. I need support and emotional intimacy and consistency. I have vivid physical flashbacks and nightmares constantly. He doesn’t understand that I just need help I’ve been lashing out because of how insecure and invalidated I am everyday. Please help me.

359,Three year relationship itch?," Hi everyone!

I (F20) have been with my girlfriend (F21) for about three years now. We’ve always been a couple who can communicate easily and listen to each other quite well and we still do. We both noticed for the past month that things just don’t go quite well.

I think we both just feel like roommates more than a couple. We get up, work/school, decide where to eat (we don’t live together) and then proceed to go to sleep. I love her deeply but don’t know if I’m currently ‘in love’.

Our sex life has never been that great. We try to improve it, but don’t know where to start (why isn’t there more sex education on lesbian bed-partners?!?!).

We’ve talked about our feelings a lot the past couple weeks, but don’t know what the exact issue is. We just get irritated at each other more often then before and don’t feel that ‘spark’ or enjoyment when we see each other again.

On a note: we see each other everyday and don’t have a lot of ‘alone time’. Almost 0. Next to that we experience both mental health issues at the moment (for me it’s a burnout and for her it’s ADHD).

Does anyone have tips on how to get past this? I can see myself grow old with her as we have about the same long distance goals. We already talked a lot and listened to each other and right now we won’t see each other for a week (for the sake of alone-time).

Tips would be much appreciated! :)

360,My (m34) wife (f35) keeps herself busy and overwhelmed all the time and I can't handle it,"I'm pretty sure I have ADHD. No official diagnosis but I've struggled with the things that people with ADHD struggle with my whole life - procrastination, forgetfulness, hyperfocus, trouble concentrating, easily distracted, trouble listening, etc. However, when I was single I was able to function pretty well. I had a number of coping strategies that made it easier:

always write things down
simplify everything. Make my life as uncomplicated as possible.
Accept that I will forget to do things and make sure those things are mostly not super important (putting away clothes vs. paying rent)
organize my stuff in an intuitive way. Wallet, keys, phone, and anything I need to remember to bring with me are always together in the same spot. Things I use often are easy to get to. Everything is grouped together so I know where to look for things. If I can't see something I will forget it is there, so important things must be visible.
This mostly worked and I was able to support myself, keep myself fed and healthy, keep my room from getting too messy, etc. My standards weren't super high but I felt they were reasonable and importantly they were achievable.

Then I moved in with my then girlfriend, now wife. I have since realized she is almost totally the opposite in how she lives her life. There is nothing that is too complicated or not worth the effort, those concepts are alien to her. No amount of added stress will make her choose not to do something, or to do it an easier way. She can't relax if there are things that need to be done, and she really hates compromising on how things should be done. Some examples:

She really likes shopping and getting things on discount (totally fine). She will always buy things that we might not need or clothes that might not fit because to her, we can always just return them. What she doesn't see is that returning them requires remembering the receipt, remembering the item, and remembering to take them back to the store. She puts all of this on herself.

Probably because of the above, we have a ton of Stuff. It's not hurting us financially (she is very good at finding good deals and discounts) but it takes up a lot of space in our house and makes a lot of clutter. As a result most of our cabinets and closets are packed together like Tetris. This makes it hard to find things and hard to put things away, since our stuff is organized more on where it fits and less by category. She is able to somehow keep track of everything for the most part.

She likes gardening and taking care of plants - not one or two kinds of plants, but like, every kind of plant. She gets so many different plants and seeds that all require different kinds of care, regular watering, etc. And then she gets busy at work and they all start to die and she gets upset.

These are just a few examples but I feel like this is how she does everything, including her fairly demanding job. And she is constantly stressed and overwhelmed by it all, but I can't get her to see how she makes herself stressed.

And I can't help her because I just can't function at that level. I can't keep track of all of those receipts and returns. I can't keep all of that stuff organized, especially when we get more stuff all the time. I can't remember to water all those plants regularly. If I was living alone I would simply not do those things and focus on basic important life maintenance tasks, with anything else just being an added bonus.

She is always stressed out because she is overwhelmed, and I am always stressed out because she is stressed out and I can't manage her workload at all. And I can't convince her to simplify things, since she takes that as me putting all of the blame on her. And she feels that I'm not reliable. And I feel like a moron because I can't even come close to her standards. Like, I swear I was able to function before I met her.

One thing I've noticed is that when she is out and I'm home alone I'm actually more productive. I think it's because I can get things done my way, on my own time, and I don't have anxiety about doing it wrong. And I can take breaks if I feel like I need it, and not beat myself up if I get distracted. But when she's there she's always in go mode, she adds tasks on top of what I'm already doing, I get anxious about not doing things the way she wants but I also don't want to pester her with questions, etc. I feel like when I can do things in a way that works for me, I am actually pretty productive, but I don't feel like I have any say in how we do things.

I don't want to end the relationship because a) we have a kid (who is wonderful but obviously exacerbates these issues), b) we do get along really well most of the time, and c) I feel like these issues are surmountable. Like I don't think this is 100% a difference of personality, I think she has an unhealthy attitude towards work and she's not very good at giving herself a break. I think this is something we can work through but I'm having trouble seeing how.

362,Am I still in love with my ex?,"TL/DR- I still think/dream about my first love despite being engaged

I’m worried I’m still in love with my ex. I’ve been in a relationship with my fiancé for two years now; and our relationship is generally good, but the beginning of the relationship was front loaded with major problems. When I first met my fiancé (23m), he was an alcoholic who would disappear in the middle of the night to go drinking with friends, among other things. He also had a porn addiction and once cheated on me. Despite all of this, we stayed together and he has worked hard to get the help he needs and work on himself to stay with me. Now, I’m not sure if it’s because of issues in my own current relationship or not, but I’ve recently been having a lost of nostalgia and longing for an ex of mine. My ex and I dated in high school and he was my first love. We dated on and off for several years but I never really saw a future with him. Despite being in love, we wanted very different things out of life and I worried I wouldn’t be happy with someone who lacked my level of ambition and adventure (my ex was a blue collar boy from my hometown who had no desire to travel or advance his career. Nothing wrong with that, just not how I pictured my life.) However, in the years since breaking up, I’ve changed my life goals and priorities and now feel I’d be perfectly happy with the life I could’ve had with him. I broke up with my ex right before meeting my fiancé, and he’s popped into my mind multiple times in the past two years, but recently the feelings seem stronger. I have constant dreams about us getting back together, and sometimes (even though it’s horrible to admit) fantasize about him knocking on my door and saying he’s never fallen out of love with me and wants to try again. Before you immediately say “yes, you are still in love with your ex” I feel it’s important to mention that I have severe anxiety disorder which often materializes in intrusive thoughts. I sometimes feel that my constant thoughts about my ex are simply anxiety based intrusive thoughts that I’m not supposed to be with my fiancé or do not love him enough. I notice that I think about my ex more whenever my fiancé and I have issues that I didn’t have with my ex. For example, my fiancé is very passive and conflict avoidant, which makes it difficult for him to stand up for me against people like his toxic family (my future MIL specifically, who hates me). In contrast, my ex was very protective over me and never afraid to speak his mind. Still, I find myself looking for any excuse to talk about my ex or hoping I’ll run into him. It doesn’t help that when my ex and I ended things, he literally told me he would never love anyone more than me and that if I ever wanted to give things another go, all I would have to do is call and he would be willing. My ex recently got a new gf for the first time since we broke up, and after finding out via social media, I immediately felt jealous, despite being engaged myself. I wonder if that is why these feelings have increased. I’m simply trying to determine if my feelings for my ex are nothing more than intrusive thoughts and first love nostalgia or something more.",z1bs9f,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z1bs9f/am_i_still_in_love_with_my_ex/,relationships
363,I (F26) don't know how to talk to my boyfriend (M26) about sex.,"Before I started my relationship with Luke 2 years ago, I had never had sex. I wasn't particularly outgoing in school/uni and have only had one relationship before Luke. Luke was really understanding even though he had had quite a bit of experience and was really happy to take things slow. He is everything I ever wanted and 100% the man I want to spend the rest of my life with. We are now sexually active and have been for well over a year but there's still a problem.

I don't think I'm any good. 

My confidence in that area is largely impacted from my lack of experience but also because Luke has a lot of difficulty finishing. We can have sex for an hour and still nothing. He says that he enjoys it and it's just something about him and I shouldn't worry but I do. I obviously have no track record that anything I am doing is right and can cause a man to finish so my confidence takes a little hit each time. I feel scared to take any control or try new things because I feel like I am failing at even the basic stuff. Whenever I have tried talking to him about it, he just says I shouldn't worry and if anything I am lucky that he can last for so long. But I know he would never say anything to hurt my feelings and wouldn't tell me if there was a problem/something I was doing wrong.

I don't if this problem will go away with time but for the last few months I have been so in my head about it that I don't want to have sex any more because I feel like I'm a disappointment. I don't want to condemn the man I love to a life of unfulfilling sex.

Please, any advice on how to retry this conversation or improve the situation would be appreciated.

364,I found photos of another woman on my partners phone,"Hi, I'm kind of new to this but I didn't really know where to turn. I just need some advice or just someone to tell me I'm not over reacting. Also this post is sort of NSFW

I (24F) have been with my partner (23M) for 3 years, we have a child together (2F), we got pregnant very early on and have just stuck it out together. I'm the only one working and he stays at home with our toddler, Im currently working almost 60 hrs a week.

I know I shouldn't have looked through his phone, I know it's toxic and bad, even if he's done it to me a lot lately (and yielded nothing). He's been secretive with his phone and just in general so when I got up early this morning I just looked.

At first it was just a shit ton of porn, most days I end up passing out before we can be intimate so fair enough I guess, I don't like that he's paying for OF, and I don't know how he gets time to look at that stuff when he's with daughter 24/7, but again, whatever.

I looked at his hidden photos and found that he had photos of our daughter in a grocery cart, at first I was confused at why he would hide photos mainly centered around our daughter at a store, then I realized that was the whole point. Behind my daughters head there was a woman, in bike shorts and all the photos were either if she was turned around or bent over. He was basically taking creep shots of a random woman during one of our grocery runs and disguising it as photos of our daughter.

I guess he did it while I was off getting something or whatever, But i genuinely feel grossed out. I've been having a hard time at work because I can't stop thinking about it. How do I even bring this up? What do I do? I knew he had an addiction to porn and looking at other girls online but this feels like it's going too far.

366,Considering ending my two year relationship,"Should I break up with my fiancé?

TL/DR (my fiancé only does the bare minimum in our relationship of 2 years) 


I’ve been with my fiancé (23M) for two years now. We’ve lived together for 1.5 years and I used to think he was my soulmate. Recently, I’ve been questioning if I’m still in love with him. It’s not one bad moment that made me question this- he hasn’t cheated or changed or anything- I just don’t feel the spark anymore. I’m starting to feel the strain of every minor issue in our relationship pile up and it’s exhausting. Everything from him not standing up for me to his toxic family who hates me, to a past porn addiction that I thought I had emotionally recovered from. Mainly, the most draining thing is that I’ve started to notice that he simply never goes the extra mile for me. He’s generally good to me, but somehow we end up having the same conversations over and over again about the same issues (his lack of time management, me needing him to compliment me more, him making anniversaries and bdays more special for me, him being emotionally distant or on his phone all the time… the list goes on and on. Don’t get me wrong, he has made major changes for me in this relationship. He went from being a “party every weekend” type of guy to always checking plans with me beforehand and always putting me above his friends. He even went from being a full blown alcoholic to going to AA and being 1.5 years sober. Part of me feels like he simply makes changes slowly but surely and it’s worth waiting it out, but another part of me feels tired of waiting to get what I need out of this relationship. I simply don’t feel loved and he knows that. No matter how many times how apologizes and swears to be better, it never seems to go beyond the bare minimum.",z15cqs,2,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z15cqs/considering_ending_my_two_year_relationship/,relationships
367,Should I stop forgiving ?,"Hi ! 
I'm [22F] and my boyfriend is [24M]. We have been dating for over a year now. 

We met octobre last year and it was a great connection since the beginning. We were both studen at the same school. We enjoyed 3 months together before he did go back in his country (Cameroun) in February.

Then I decided to go there with him in May. As my visa was taking long I ended up there in June.

When I got there he was really distant and quite strange. He sais that because his phone was giving him difficulties as he was focusing on is finals exam. So I gave him mine for quite some time with my computer for him to finish in good condition.

As he was using it I logged in using his email address. I started noticing that his ""bestfriend"" was a bit weird by text... She would send him quite provocative message and heart.

So I decided to not do anything as I was stunned... At that time I was living in his family in Cameroun far from mine. I was there for an internship that lasted 3 months.

From June to September I lost over 20 kilos. In August the best friend requested to live at his family with us. Still he was in denied ajout anything happening. Then his ex decided to show up in my room, still I was fine as he say nothing will happen.

The best friend on the other hand was furious and never cool down.

At that time I was puzzled about was should I do. 
Then in begging of August both the best friend and the ex decided to go away. 
The best friend admitted that she regularly slept with my boyfriend.

As I was at the end of the internship I let it slide. I forgot him and decided to give him a second chance.

He finally got his visa and we when back in my country.
Now it's been few months and I smell some weird stuff again. Do you thing I should dump him ? Break up ?

Do you thing someone can change that much ? Would you trust him again ?
Please tell me some else did go through that and could help me

368,My Girlfriend Gets Upset Over Minor Things,"TLDR: My (26 M) girlfriend (24 F) gets angry over what I perceive to be very minor things, and it’s starting to put a strain on our relationship. We’ve had conversations about it, but it keeps happening. 

We’ve been dating for almost 4 months (so not very long). Things just “clicked” pretty early on, and we got serious fast (we’ve already started basically living together, made plans for her to move with me after I graduate grad school this summer, etc).

However, there’s one problem. My girlfriend gets angry at me a lot for small things. A few examples: - she was angry with me this morning because I woke and scrolled through Twitter while waking up instead of cuddling her (she was asleep and I just wanted some time to wake up) - she was upset this weekend because she did her makeup and I didn’t say she was pretty afterwards (I do call her pretty/beautiful/cute very often, and I mean it. I didn’t that morning mostly because I was working on a memo while she was getting ready and my brain was still in work mode when we were ready to leave) - She was upset that I didn’t appear to be excited enough to see her when I came to her apartment to watch a movie. When I explained that I absolutely was excited to see her but was just a little fatigued from class, she just shut down and wouldn’t talk to me - she was upset that I didn’t want her to wax my chest hair. I did give in after she asked more, but she was still upset because I didn’t immediately say yes (I explained originally that I didn’t want to because she had no preference about my body hair, it hurts, and I don’t like how my bare chest looks) - I’m sometimes clumsy and sometimes trip/stumble when walking/spill things/forget things like my keys (this is definitely true, I really try but I can’t always help it)

These things are pretty minor, but I’ve found that they’re really starting to add up and cause me a lot of distress. We’ve had conversations about this before, and she said that she definitely has some anger issues, but also thinks that I need to learn how to handle her better (meaning when she gets in a mood, I need to provide her more reassurance rather than have a conversation in the moment about it). I think it’s an understandable request, but I also feel like I’m being asked to put out fires that shouldn’t have been started in the first place. I feel nitpicked and not good enough, and it’s giving me anxiety.

I have tried not to get defensive and to listen to what she says, but it’s really difficult because 1) when I try to hear her out, she just shuts down; and 2) candidly, I just don’t think a lot of these things are worth getting upset over. She’s told me a lot that she is very anal and I have tried being understanding, but it just feels like I’ll always be nitpicked.

How can I talk to her about this? Am I wrong for thinking that these things shouldn’t be that big of a deal? Have any of you had a similar experience?

This is my first real serious relationship, and I’m willing to put in the work to make it work for us. I think there are a lot of things I really like about her, but I’m afraid it will become toxic if this isn’t addressed. I feel guilty because sometimes when I get some alone time, I feel a small sense of relief.",z1a9ol,1,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z1a9ol/my_girlfriend_gets_upset_over_minor_things/,relationships
369,How I a M(18) should get this girl F(17) be interested in me whom I met online on Instagram? I have know her for a few weeks.,"So I met this girl a couple of months ago. Never had a lot of conversation but from a few days I am trying to approach her and trying to initiate a conversation. Sometimes she talks and sometimes she doesn't. She really like cats and soft songs is into religion a bit  (Islam) . Alright, so i see relationships as a long term thing with a definitive end like marriage. For me any relationship which doesn't gonna end at marriage leads to easy heart break. You start liking each other fall in love then after 3 months as soon as the honeymoon phase ends people break up. Which kind of isn't for me. So she has the same ideology as me regarding this. Yesterday night while talking she told that there was this guy M(17) whom she met last year and she mentioned this a freaking date and month. Which kinda surprised me so she said she used to talk to this guy for 4-5 months and he grew really strong feelings for and he also liked him. But when the guy proposed her she rejected him even after liking him. She said she sometimes feel really sad for what she did to him. But slowly and gradually her conversation with him decreased and now only ""hi -  hello"" . They both don't talk to each other alot now. And I also was quite into her considering our same ideologies and love for cats too. I wanted to gain her attention in the most subtle way so she doesn't feel overwhelmed. I dont have any Muslim female friends and coming from India and also as a person who is interested in his religion I would want a girl who is also on the same boat as me. She seems perfect to me. I just want to know how to get her interested in me? She is a little anti social introverted person. So keeping a conversation going can get hard with her. At this point I am of being alone and I really want someone in my life. Guys, just give me your advices and opinions on this.

371,"My brother(15m) and his girlfriend(15) are starting to get on my nerves, how do I make the situation better for all of us and our family?","First off, they are together for a year, I didn't mind it in the beginning, but this became insufferable. Basically she is a goth girl from his class in high school(I'm 2 years older than them) and being a brother of someone who has a goth girlfriend is not nearly as pretty as you would think, she literally fits almost every possible stereotype: she has a black hair, uses black lipstick, polishes her nails in black, wears all black: boots, skirts and crop tops, often wears a necklace with some symbolism etc, he is not any better... He was always a fan of ''edgy things'', since like 3th-4th grade, he was obsessed with Creepypasta stories during the middle school, got in abandoned ''haunted houses'' with his friends in the forest close to our home, tried summoning human spirits and whatnot etc. He calmed down *a little bit* about all of this for a few years and then got together with her last year and this shit started again, they talk about horror movies, games, anarchism and animes non-stop, always listen some stupid music etc, every time I try to hang out with them, they don't have anything else to talk about. At least he is asexual so I don't have to worry about becoming an uncle while still in high-school...

He had a short curly brown hair all his life, now it's pitch black straight as arrow and shoulder length, he had a blue-green eye color, mostly green, now he wears white eye contacts, when I say white, I mean pure white, his eyes are literally pure white color with just black pupils! He has a weaker sight on his left eye so he must wear contacts, but when we wanted to buy him colorless or in some beautiful color, he chose just pure white. This Halloween he scared me half to death when he showed up with a ''blood'' smile makeup on his face(kind of like Joker), it was so realistic that I though it's legit blood on his mouth, I calmed down as soon as I realized it's just a makeup and he literally spent hundreds of dollars of his budget on a doll Chucky from horror movies for this Halloween!! It's his budget, I don't care he can spend it on whatever he wants, but still WTF.

The main problem in this is that they are always like this, I don't give a shit about what they do and talk in room alone, I can even endure them for a few hours myself, but it became worse when the rest of the family saw them and knew about them, our parents are divorced and mother doesn't have a problem with it, never had even with him before, father would probably kill them both on spot if he saw them personally(he is fairly conservative), one time they were sitting on couch in living room when cousins came, he literally either didn't give a shit about them or didn't hear them and continued cuddling with her while they watched TV, they of course saw them, thankfully our mother always fixes the situation or problem quickly and they ran in his room after, but I was still embarrassed that they saw her and him *like that.* Grandparents know and don't give a shit, I can only imagine what would the father's side of the family think(they don't even celebrate Halloween let alone...). The other time neighbors saw them and it was awkward, we know each other since childhood and see each other, well basically everyday, but it's still awkward nonetheless, cousins who came are polite and played it cool but it was a wtf moment, they literally kept cuddling not giving a damn about cousins who came first time in like a year and that wouldn't be much of a problem at all if they don't look..*.the way they look like*. Most of the family who didn't see us for a year or longer won't recognize him.

So how do I cope with the fact that my brother and his girlfriend are like this, if you think about ''well just ignore them'', it's impossible, they are together every day, in school they don't separate from each other, sometimes they even ''escape'' from classes when their bullshit works on teachers, heard about it a few times, after school they always come to home and smooch and hug for like an hour in his room, then they bore me for like 4 hours until someone doesn't get back home, they go to room, watch TV and then and all over again, for weekends it's the same except it's all day and she sleeps here. It's more awkward because of the family than me, since holidays are slowly coming, family gatherings are coming with them, as I said the cousins who came are polite and played it cool, didn't even give us ''the looks'', but that isn't even remotely the case for...some of the other members of family who are coming, last year we dodged it because of virus that was still going on, but now God help me...

373,"Gf (25) of two years broke up with me (m 29), is thoughts about reconciling a bad idea?","GF (F, 25) broke up with me (M, 29) two weeks ago. Not sure if I should try to reconcile or not.

I had been seeing my ex for about two years. We met during Covid, had some IRL dates before switching to virtual and then started dating IRL again once we got vaccinated. We both told each other I love you about 9 months into our relationship. The first year went really well, but as soon as 2022 rolled around some issues began to crop up. For some background, I do have an anxiety disorder that does make it hard to do certain things such as driving. Earlier this year, I lost my job and then had to take on two jobs that barely got me by. During this time, she was dealing with her own worries of coming up on being 25, working three jobs to just get by and not being sure what to do with her life and her own mental health issues. Right around the time I got my current job in May, we had a kerfuffle and barely talked for a week, but I owned up to my part in it and we talked about it as a couple and had a good summer. I started going to therapy to deal with my anxiety and she got one job that suited her skills and paid well, but it demanded a lot of time and work from her.   


Near the middle of this, an old friend of mine had a mental break and began to stalk me. After that situation was resolved, she wanted the weekend to herself instead of spending time with me which made me feel very isolated. We had a discussion of how she wants more space and I agreed we could work on something. We begun to move into September and things seemed pretty ok...  


October hit though and it became difficult again. One weekend we basically did nothing but errands and she told me it felt like out hangouts devolved into nothing but running errands and she wanted more space again, which I gave her. We then went on our anniversary trip and had a moment where she was so tired her mental health issues reared up and she was too tired and I then had an anxiety attack for ruining the trip. The following week was our Halloween party and we were both really on edge. The day after, she came back from therapy and tearfully told me that there was an emotional disconnect right now due to 'growing pains' in our lives and that I met all her needs as her partner, but she felt like she was mothering me too much with my mental illness and I needed to do more emotional labor on my part. I told her I would and she left for a business trip. During her trip, I wanted to bring up what I was willing to do for us going forward.   


Then, the Sunday of that week, she calls me. She tells me that she can't lie to herself or me any longer and that she no longer views me as a partner. She told me there's things in her life she needs to work on that don't involve me in those future plans. She told me she wanted me in her life in some capacity and would come get her things on the 10th (her birthday) and talk more about it.   


The 10th came and went and she never showed. She still has me on all her social media accounts. A mutual friend of ours heard through the grapevine she is doing 'ok'. It's been two weeks since this has happened and I have a lot of questions I want closure on. I haven't done anything to contact her since then. Would it be worth to try and contact her down the line to see if I can get those answers, or even attempt to reconcile? I really do love this woman and I miss her.

374,My girlfriend is becoming more and more distant to me.,"I created this account so that I could seek for advice from here, as I was recommended by a friend.

I(20m) have been dating my girlfriend (20f) for almost 4 months now. The first weeks of the relationship were very good, she would ask me how my day went, tell me how she's going to spend the day, send good morning and good night texts with heart emojis. We also used to talk a lot about our future, and how we both wanted this thing to work out long term.

I was happy, and I believe she was too. However, since the end of last month, she has grown very distant to me, she doesn't pick up calls and doesn't put in effort to call back. She stopped sending good night texts, I am always putting in effort to initiate conversation this time round and she responds with dry texts, if she even responds. For example she hasn't yet responded to my good morning text today, and it's almost 4pm in my country.

Last time I saw her in person was on Saturday, we hang out the whole day and she seemed like her normal self but seemed to be in a rush to go see her friend that same night, and I ended up walking her there. She did not update me that very night and only responded to my text when I asked if she got dinner that night in the afternoon, on Sunday.

It's becoming so hard to talk to her when I am not physically around her, taking hours to respond to my texts, even though she is online and updates her status. Communication has always been key in this relationship and I have been telling her to tell me if something is wrong to which she says it's all good, she's just ""busy"".

Should I be worried? Is it possible that she is seeing someone else or she's genuinely busy. She does the same course as one of my friends and he responds to my texts or picks up the phone when I call but that's not the case for my girlfriend.

I would appreciate advice on what to do from here because this has been eating me up for a while, I am unable to focus in class and so on. 

tl;dr : my girlfriend has changed the way she treats me in many way and become very distant to me in the past few days which has been bothering me a lot.",z0vbys,5,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z0vbys/my_girlfriend_is_becoming_more_and_more_distant/,relationships
375,Is it normal for a 28 yr old female to not want close female friends?,"Is it normal to not want close female friends?

Back in school all the way up to adulthood, I had “acquaintances”, but for the most part, as a woman, I don’t trust women at all. I also need a lot of space and solitude. I have always thought friendships were energy draining and prefer to be alone for the most part. The thought of hanging out with someone like that (outside of a actual relationship) does not sound fun at all. My “boyfriend” does not think it is normal that I don’t really want “close” friends. We’re already on the rocks and that’s an entire story on its own. Is this normal? Can anyone else relate?

376,I (17M) snitched on my stepsister (17F) for having her friends over after she mocked me.,"So my dad and stepmom are away for the next 8 days as they are at the desert for their honeymoon. Me, my stepsister and stepbrother are all home alone rn, cause me and my stepsister have school and my stepbrother has a job. I guess my stepbrother was left ""in charge"" but I don't think ive talked or even seen him in like a week since he works night shifts and when he leaves for work I am usually just coming home from school. So for the past 3 days Ive only seen my stepsister around the house, NGL im not her biggest fan so we try to just avoid eachother as much as possible.

My stepmom and dad don't have a lot of rules for us since we're about to graduate anyways but a real big one is that no friends are over when they're not home, end of discussion. I got home pretty late last night and had a pretty rough day, don't wanna get into all of it but I fell face first into a big mud puddle walking to my car. When I walked my stepsister had 2 of her friends over and they were in the living room watching the football game. Her friends didnt but I saw her smirking at me for how I looked and after that I had enough.

I went to my room and put a pic of her and her friends on the couch in the family group chat. My stepmom was not happy, things went quiet till her friends left but she was PISSED at me. Like more than she almost ever is. I told her then she shouldn't have mocked me, she then called me soft and how I can't ""take a joke literally ever"". I really wasn't in the mood to listen and told her to just leave me alone and she went away still really mad. Probably cracked her door from slamming it so hard lol. I guess she was complaining to her brother about me and he texted me and called me a baby and petty for what I did.

At this point I really don't give AF about what either think but I am curious now cause even my friends say I was being really petty.

Thoughts/advice on all of this?

377,Dating a really skinny guy,"So over the past two weekends I started seeing this guy, and we have already told each other how much we like eachother and that we would feel uncomfortable seeing other people. He is near perfect (obviously no one is perfect), he is kind, generous, caring, intelligent, and we have common interests and can have a conversation for hours. Only thing is he is really skinny. Like really really skinny, to a point that seems concerning. He is 6""3 and weighs 130 pounds. I am 5""10 and weigh around 145 pounds. When I was struggling with unhealthy eating habits I weighed his weight minus a little. I asked if he has struggled with an eating disorder, and he said he doesn't. We have spent two weekends together and have eaten together, but I did notice that he doesn't eat that much. Should I be concerned? Or is this normal, and he is just naturally super skinny? I thought I would be insecure and mind the weight difference, but honestly he is so great that his bony hips don't seem too much of an issue. Only thing is though, when getting intimate, I do wish he was a little bit bigger, but I guess that is not such a big deal.

378,I (17f) caught feelings for someone even though I have a boyfriend (16m),"For some background information, I've been with my
boyfriend for 3-ish years now. Around a year ago, he
moved to another country a year ago and we've been
long distance.

The problem is I caught feelings for a friend of mine
and now I'm not sure of what to do. I know I should
be honest and tell him the truth but I'm confused.

I know that the most reasonable choices are:
1. Get over the crush
2. Break up with him

But my feelings for this person are too strong and I
can't seem to get over them no matter what I do. I
can't break up with my boyfriend either since every
aspect of my life (friends, family, etc.) is intertwined
with him and I'm scared of what people might say.
Everyone basically expects us to get married, have
babies, and everything else high school sweethearts
do. Meanwhile, my friend makes me feel electric and
births butterflies in my stomach.

I have this inkling that I only caught feelings because
my boyfriend's not here and if my boyfriend comes
back, everything will go back to normal. I love him, I
really do but I can't control my feelings for my friend.

Should I leave something comfortable, sensible, safe
yet monotonous for something exciting, electrifying,
and thrilling yet unstable?

I know I'm not being the most sensible person right now, but please please be kind. I really need help.

379,"I [27M] and having a difficult time accepting my girlfriend [29F] is best friends with her exes who are swingers [53M,F]","* TL;DR: Girlfriend \[29\] used to be in a throuple and swinger community with older white couples and did not tell me when we were casually dating. Now that we are exclusively dating, she hasn't redefined the relationship with them to where I am comfortable and I'm having a hard time navigating. Her best friends are also the couple she was in a throuple with.

I met this amazing woman last year and we casually dated (no labels) but I never approached it to be anything more since I always had a gut feeling something was wrong.

5-6 months in, she tells me that she is part of the swingers lifestyle and that she has been a unicorn for this wealthy couple (let's call them Jack and Jill) who are older. She also has a friend group from this engagement who are all married people yet she is younger and a POC. She's only had one long term relationship before and has since been in this lifestyle with these people since the start of the pandemic. In addition to the lifestyle, she's pursued a relationship with Jack on the side without Jill knowing and did not tell me about any of this until half a year in - meanwhile, I was kept in the dark with everything and I let her know every time I was with other people yet her throuple got to know everything about me down to the details of when and where we would go on dates.

I myself am a very open person sexually and I've worked a lot on my self-esteem, confidence, self-image. etc. in therapy over the years but this definitely caught me off guard. Not because I'm insecure about her personal-life and experiences but because of the lack of transparency and also my own sexual health and how unfair it is for her to hide that from me.

I called it off with her a few weeks after that conversation since she couldn't decide between being with me or staying with them. A few months after of dating other people (and her rekindling and dating Jack again), me and her reconnected and started to hang out again. We developed feelings once again but this time around I let her know that I just want to try at an exclusive monogamous relationship and she doesn't have to cut her ""friends"" off but clear boundaries have to be set and I need us to take time away from other romantic/sexual engagements. I cut off all the women I was talking to at the time but with her relationship with the lifestyle and with Jack/Jill, she has done nothing other than not have sex with them.

With where we are at in a relationship now of 4 months, I am looking for advice on how to proceed. I've been going to sex therapy to better understand and communicate my feelings around how I feel about her being so close with Jack/Jill since as a boyfriend now, I can see how manipulative they are of her and how much control they have. They make her apologize for not spending time with them and hold money over her head. However, she still doesn't tell me about when she hangs out with them until after the fact, she still is looking to attend their lifestyle parties, and when we go out, the way they touch/interact with her makes me feel horrible. There's other things that have happened but in summary, I've bent over backwards to make her, Jack/Jill, them feel more comfortable and also set strong boundaries up with women pursuing me, yet, outside of the intimacy aspect, it seems like there's still an emotional intimacy and tie to this and it doesn't seem fair.

Today, we had set a date where I was going to cook for her, we would go to a show after, and then go spend the evening together and I would spend the night. Last minute as I'm checking out at the grocery store, she texts me to see if I can come earlier so we can eat and do everything early so she can go to a last minute concert with Jack/Jill since they got her a ticket. I reacted in a negative way since I know I felt like my time as a boyfriend was not respected but since it's so nuanced that her BEST FRIENDS are people who she's been romantically, physically, and sexually associated with and she just says they are all her friends but I can make the same case for the women I've pursued. I just still feel like I'm in an open relationship regardless of what she tells me since i haven't felt like there’s certain relationships that have been solidified as “friends” yet and if they're the closest people to her yet I still have no insight on these new boundaries, then maybe I'm not in the right space at the moment bc I’m not the person who can do everything to be a good boyfriend and know my girlfriend’s best friends is her ex sugar daddy, folks she's had wild sex with, and most importantly, a weird racial, economic, and fetishizing dynamic that I don't know how to proceed.

I feel like it's me against them and I don't want to put an ultimatum since it's me against her only friend group...but they treat her bad and make her feel bad and as a boyfriend, I want her to have her support group but as a friend, I can see this going bad long term. Thoughts?

380,Accused of racism & abuse.,"Don’t know if this is the right sub for this kind of post but to preface this, I (20f) have anxiety and false memory  OCD so this has been causing me tremendous amounts of distress and I would appreciate any advice or even just kind words. 
As the title says, I have been accused of abusing my ex-boyfriend from over a year ago. Finding this out was a shock to me because I endured so much crap throughout this relationship but have still taken full accountability for *my* part in the demise of the relationship. I have even apologized to him for my actions and even wished him happiness with the girl he started dating after me before I found out he was painting me out as his abuser. I’m in this weird place of not knowing if I abused him or not and I need help. 

My ex (19m) has a tendency of lying. He blatantly lied about multiple little things throughout the entirety of this relationship and I know this because I caught him in these lies. He told a super big lie and kept it going for five straight months until an ex girlfriend of his reached out to me and told me. I believed her because I was already suspicious of him. She went back and told him that her and I talked and he was guilt tripping me by saying things like “I’m telling the truth but I don’t know if you’d believe me” and stuff like that knowing full well that he *was* lying and could have come clean right then and there. He only admitted to this lie like three months later when a friend caught him lying. Even when he came clean he was still lying. He also lied and said I had been fetishizing and being racist towards Asian people which **never** happened. I got the courage to go back through all my texts with this ex (this relationship was primarily long distance) and found that I had *never* said anything racist or prejudiced so I do have proof of that. 

When we were dating, my grandma passed away and none of my friends reached out to me which obviously hurt. One of those friends even texted me during that time to ask me for a favor but didn’t offer condolences or anything which added onto said hurt so I had a moment of lashing out and cutting all those friends off in my grief which created tension between my ex and I because we had the same group of friends. He would go out of his way to invalidate my feelings about my grief and me being hurt about people that I had known for three years not being there for me in one of the hardest times of my life by consistently making excuses as to why they didn’t reach out or whatever. Over time, he started to prefer the friends over me which hurt because he wouldn’t have met any of them had he not met me since I introduced them. He would complain that we didn’t spend time together anymore and when we would spend time together, he’d secretly he playing video games on his phone with his friends which upset me. I would try to have mature conversations with him about how I felt and he would always say the same thing so I just left it alone but it still bothered me. 

I am in no way completely innocent in this relationship. I was very aware of the fact that I had issues with jealousy, insecurity, and trusting but I did never accused him of cheating or anything. I do remember being upset that he gave one his friends his password because we had previously shared our passwords but he changed his so it felt weird that he would give it to someone else when he had mine but I didn’t have his. I also lashed out at him a few times after losing my friends and grandma but I am stuck on how this would make me abusive? I never wanted to or tried to control him. I just wanted him to hear me and understand why I felt the way I did without invalidating me or making excuses for other people. He had even apologized to ME for how he treated me so I’m unsure. I think this relationship is toxic at best and I just have a lot of anxiety about this. What should I do?

381,I want my ex back but I have anxiety,"Hi everyone.

TL;DR - I fucked it up with my ex because I had anxiety, but I’ve gotten better and hope it’s not too late to get her back. 

Please read the full thing as it’s complicated.

I (22M) started dating my now ex girlfriend (19F) in February 2020. We dated for a year and a half. We live in the UK and dated long distance throughout covid and the multiple lockdowns - we’re 90 minutes drive from each other. When lockdown lifted  in August 2021 I had a massive panic attack and completely broke down, and I very ry made a change tashly broke up with her - to this day it’s my biggest regret.

We stayed friends but we still had feelings for each other, and in February this year, I admitted that I still loved her and, even though it was still affecting me, I didn’t want my anxiety to get in the way anymore. We met up in a neutral spot halfway between our cities to see each other, and I had an amazing time. We laughed, held hands and kissed. When I got home again though, I still felt anxious and I didn’t know why. I knew I loved her, but I’ve had a lot of issues with family in the past (my dad left when I was 3 and my mum left when I was 18), and I just completely froze up. I had also started my first job after graduating from uni and was finding it hard. We eventually agreed that I wasn’t ready for a relationship.

Understandably, she was very upset and I felt incredibly guilty for hurting her twice. But I knew that I had to make a change if I was going to save or start back up any romantic relationship with her. So, for the next 8 months, I attended regular therapy sessions with two therapists, and started to change my priorities in life to become more self aware of my anxiety and stop it from getting out of control. My second therapist explained that I was struggling with abandonment issues and that what happened was likely a defence mechanism to protect myself from being vulnerable and abandoned again, since she is the only person I feel that I have trusted with my secrets and insecurities. We still continue to text every day and call a couple of times a week for about an hour each time. We’re even facetiming tonight for the first time in months.

This realisation changed everything. I knew for a fact that I still wanted to be with her, even after all of this time (it’s been over 8 months since we tried again). I have considered moving on, but no one I have met makes me feel the way she did and still does. I really feel like I have changed and although I still struggle with anxiety in some situations, I feel a lot more in control now. When I realised all of this, I cried in my car for an hour and a half. It finally felt like I understood the root of my anxiety and that I could move forward with her after trying so hard to improve myself. She even made me rethink my views on starting a family - something I was dead set against due to my own family experiences. I knew that she was the love of my life and that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, so I made the decision to tell her how I felt. 

I called her to say that I still loved her and wanted to get back together. But she said that it’s been too long and that I hurt her a lot. She said that she has been on a date with two other people since we broke up, one of which didn’t work out, and that she doesn’t feel the same way for me anymore. And even said that things could never go back to the way they were because she has / has tried to move on with other people. But she also said that she really does care about me because we are so close and we were each others first real relationship. She said that she doesn’t actively have feelings for me but wants to stay friends because I’m funny and attractive etc - she just isn’t attracted to me like that anymore and she said that she doesn’t want to give me false hope. I told my therapist about the situation and she suggested the possibility of meeting each other again in person. So, I asked her and she said that she would feel awkward and that I’d be meeting her with an ulterior motive.

Since then, I haven’t been able to sleep very well and I’ve cried a lot. We have talked about it a few times since, and she asked why I took so long to tell her how I felt. I said that I wanted to prove to her that I had changed and that if I had told her soon after it happened, she wouldn’t ave believed that. But at the same time, yesterday we called and she told me that she doesn’t think that it’s going to work out with the other guy (she didn’t say anything more than that). She also agreed with me that we can’t predict the future that we wouldn’t get back together again in the future but that she didn’t feel the same for me right now. And she says that she doesn’t want space from me. When I asked her about meeting up again in a few weeks time, she said that she’d think about it because it would “depend on where she was at in her life” and that she would think about it closer to the time.

I don’t know what to do - am I stupid for still believing that she might still have some feelings for me? Is there hope that she could change her mind about me, or do you think that her feelings are really gone? If they are, then why does she still want me to be there without giving her space? Is she keeping me there as a second option, or could she actually come around? Most importantly, how do I get her back?

383,My ex boyfriend told me after 3 years that he had fallen out love w me and I could've never imagined that.,"My ex and I were childhood lovers, it was very young and innocent kind of a relationship that lasted for 4 years before we seperated.

The breakup was really hard but over the years as we moved on, we managed to restore our friendship and have been friends for a while. We still care for each other. Anytime we bump into problems in our current relationships, we try to self reflect and talk to each other if there has been a pattern. Before y'all come at me, it has been very healthy so far.

A few days ago, he broke up w his girlfriend, he told me he fell out of love and maybe it's a pattern. I asked him if he did w me too and he said yes. 
Although I had ended the relationship, the last few months of our relationship were incredibly difficult for me but very blurry as I try to recollect.

I have only one memory of us before we called it quits, where in we were in a concert, it was a cold winter night and it suddenly started raining and as the crowd rushed for shelter, he took off his jacket to cover me, we laughed and kissed as the singer kept singing his most romantic titles, it was a very main character moment, the love I experienced was the kind you only find in the books.

What scares me is that, apparently he had fallen out of love w me by then. And in that moment, I would've never even thought of that. It's so scary that the person in front of you suddenly stops feeling the same way about you and you'd never ever know.
I wouldn't have even known till this day until he finally managed to find the balls to tell me.

If only he would've told me much before (maybe right after I broke up w him?) I would've moved on so much sooner. It took me 2 years to move on from that relationship because, even though I ended it, I regretted and kept blaming myself for letting that go.  I kept holding onto the hope that we still had a chance. It was brutal.

My current relationship is beautiful and amazing and very happy. I'm so scared that it might happen again, in my happiest moment and I wouldn't know.

I know it wasn't my fault, that I couldn't have anything to prevent it but I'm the kind of a person who tries to control everything in her life. Idk what to do. Maybe at least to have it hurt a little less? 

TL;DR: I'm so scared my current boyfriend will fall out of love with me just like my ex did and I can't stop thinking about it.

384,I (19M) don’t know what to do about my ex (19F) anymore,"So a while back my ex and I broke up, like over a year ago now.
We broke up twice, once because of her forced me to do things sexually when I’d repeatedly told her I didn’t want to, where I then went on to sleep with someone else who we were both close friends with, but after we broke up (I also didn’t really want to do this but I think she was doing it as a way to try and comfort me). Then we got back together because we both did something shitty but still liked each other, and then a few months later she cheated on me on the first night I went to a nightclub with her (first night of freshers week, when uni was starting). She then went on to sleep with that mutual friend too, and try to do it again multiple times, just to make me feel like shit even more.

I’ve gotten over it all and hadn’t seen her for ages, but I’ve now moved into a new accommodation and I’ve recently found out that she’s been telling everyone that I cheated on her with that friend, as well as not telling them any of the other stuff that happened (including lying to her new boyfriend and all her friends about it). So she’s getting all the sympathy for everything when I never cheated and everyone thinks I’m an asshole, I don’t know what to do about it and how to get across my side of the story, because it’s literally everyone around me gives me dirty looks because of it and won’t go near me.

385,"Best friend of 6 years (25F) has ghosted me out of the blue, and it's breaking my (25F) heart.","So I've been best friends with this girl for 6 years now, she was literally like my sister all these years and the one constant in my life. She used to say we were ""soulmates"" or whatever. We never had any quarrels but there was the occasional shady comment which was resolved quickly. But just this year, she randomly stopped replying to my texts. It was when I came back from university- she reached out once saying we should meet up loads now that I'm back and I agreed, and then suddenly stopped replying to my texts. 

I reached out once just to ask for an explanation or have I done anything wrong to upset her, and she said ""no you haven't done anything wrong at all, I've just been so busy! I want to see you but life just gets in the way sometimes!"", but we still didn't talk after that and I would see on socials she would be out with her other friends (who she used to talk s\*\*\* about to me.)  


I had my birthday pass and she didn't wish me a happy birthday or post me on socials or anything like she usually does, but earlier she'd said that when her birthday comes around a month later, we're all going to do something for a joint birthday. But I've just seen on social media stories she's had her birthday celebration with all the other girls without me. She posted it openly, too, obviously not caring if I would see it.  


I know this sounds silly, but this has kinda broken my heart. Feels worse than a breakup. Much worse. I loved that girl like my sister and only last year we had talked about our weddings and being each other's maid of honours and all that corny stuff. I thought we'd be in each-other's lives forever, it was that kind of friendship.  


How should I deal with this? Should I just unfollow her so the ghosting is not in my face? I respect if she doesn't want our friendship anymore for whatever reason, but I feel like I've been lead on by her and I wish she'd been honest with me.

With this new girl, I figured I'd act on my feelings rather than ignore them like the last girl.

So I work in retail now, this girl and I work different departments so our paths only cross in the break room. I've gotten to know her in the last few months during our breaks. We have a lot of shared interests and have interesting conversations. She seems really cool and she's very pretty and I started developing a crush. I like to think I'm good at gauging if someone is interested in me (clearly I'm not since I'm typing this), but usually my assumptions are correct. I thought she found me as interesting as well, based on her body language, laughing at my dumb jokes, the way she talks to me etc. She's really shy around others but opens up around me.

Remember, I know dating coworkers is a bad idea, so I wouldn't have asked her out unless I had a good feeling about it. Last Friday we talked about a movie she wanted to see, I figured I'd make a move and I wanted to ask her out but there were others with us in the break room so I waited for a time when we were alone. We got off at the same time, and I caught up to her in the parking lot where I told her something along the lines of ""Hey (girls name), I meant to ask you earlier but I was wondering if you'd be down to watch (movie) in theaters next week if you're free?"". She goes ""Uhhhhh..suuuuure..when?"". Based off her tone, I knew it was a miss. I said anytime next week, got her number and told her we can plan it out over the phone.

I waited a day, Saturday, before messaging her the date and times for the showing and she responded with ""I'll let you know"" (Uh oh) and ""If I'm not doing anything on monday, I'm down"". I took that response as a no. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but I figured if she was interested, she would say ""I cant this day but I'm free this day"", as has happened to me before when girls had mutual interest.

So we kept texting over the weekend about how her day is going or about a show we were bonding over in the break room. Her responses tended to be uninterested and spaced out by several hours. Completely opposite to how we interact in person. Maybe she's a bad texter? Then again, she's always on her phone at work, it's a slow job and she worked the entire weekend. I know we're all busy with our lives and I don't expect rapid replies (I don't respond immediately either), but everyone always has their phone on them these days. At a slow job like ours, where she's always on her phone, I knew she just wasn't interested.

So on Monday, the day of the movie, I still didn't have a yes or no. I asked her something like ""So are we on for today or no? If you have plans, I understand, lmk!"". By this point, I wanted to get out of it, the vibes were not there and I added that last bit in the text to make it easier for her to decline. So I waited and waited and got no response. I thought that was pretty rude to leave someone hanging like that. If you're not interested, tell me, no hard feelings and just move on. Instead she replied a whole day later saying ""sorry i couldnt go yesterday, maybe we can go another time or something lmao"". I simply replied with ""no worries, it's all good"".

I'm not interested in taking her up on that offer. For one, the movie is no longer showing so there is no ""other time"" we can see it. Second, she clearly isn't into me or respects me enough to be straight up about it. I've dealt with girls like this before and at 26, I'm just too tired to deal with these kinds of games. I deleted her number as well, as I have no intention of asking her out again.

I saw her while walking by at work the other day and we said good morning but that was it. I expect things between us to be awkward from now on. It's a bummer cause I liked her but I guess thats dating.

Should I still be on talking terms with her? I don't want to make it obvious if I stop talking to her or whatever. But like I said, I deleted her number. It's been almost a week since I replied to her message. The show we're watching and have been bonding over is ending this week and I don't plan to be all ""did you see last nights episode?!"" as usual, and I don't know if she'll ask me like she normally does. I don't know how the break room vibe will be. Not really interested in being friends either as I always saw her from a romantic perspective, and the friendship, from my side at least, won't be based on anything genuine. And after the whole mess of leaving me hanging all day wondering whether we'd be going out or not, I don't know if I want to be friends with someone like that, I guess I have less respect for her now. Mainly I'm just confused about how badly I misread her, I liked talking with her and how that probably gonna go away now.

387,"Parents coddle mentally-ill brother, need advice","My (21F) brother (22M) has never had a job and is a college dropout. He enrolled in college after graduating high school but dropped out after one year. He now sleeps in until 3pm every day, spends each day in his room, lying in bed, playing games until 5am and talking to people he’s met over the internet. Although he has interviewed for maybe a few jobs in the past year, he's apparently has never been successful. His reasoning for dropping out of college was that ‘college is useless and teaches you nothing’ and that 'he could still be successful without a college degree' yet it’s been 4 years since high school and he has done nothing. When my parents raise this issue with him, he shuts down and tells them to stop getting on his case, that it 'takes time for some people to find their path' and that he’s ‘learning about running a business’. This is if he isn’t responding to my parents in monosyllabic grunts (which is most of the time).

He believes that everything comes easy and that opportunities will fall right into his lap without having to work for them. He’s talked about not wanting to work a 9 to 5 and how there’s people who become billionaires without going to college, but fails to consider just how little people actually manage to accomplish this and just how much work they put in. He also talks about how he's heard from people online that getting into the Ivy Leagues (Harvard, Yale etc.) 'actually isn't that hard' and 'if only he'd applied, he'd have gotten in'. Never mind the fact that he dropped out of college after a year.

Now I want to say that he’s always been a very introverted, shy person and has trouble communicating with people. I suspect that he was bullied in high school (my parents asked but he wouldn't tell them anything) and probably has some self esteem issues as well as social anxiety. He also has some developmental delays from childhood where he started reading and speaking later than the other kids, that make me suspect autism. He is also non-communicative with my family. Whenever asked a question, he responds with a grunt, or mumbles something under his breath that we can't hear. He also is not very physically fit - though not particularly overweight, he is very weak and can't make it very far without being out of breath, and also has trouble holding things as he has shaky hands.

I'm mentioning this because, as a result of his poor social skills and physical problems, my parents coddle him. They give him an allowance of $50 a week which he uses on UberEats and spends on games. They used to encourage him to apply for jobs or think about going back to college but have stopped, because he either completely ignores them or responds with an argument about how 'they're being too harsh on him' and that 'they bring up the same thing every time'. I think they're also afraid of coming off too overbearing the more they pester him, which would distance him from them even more. They also believe, due to his timid and shy personality, that it's justified that he'll never be able to live normally or get a job. They would never consider cutting him off as he has no life skills, no friends to crash with, and are worried that he might spiral or commit suicide if he has no one to rely on. He's also recently been showing some concerning behaviours - he's been wandering around the neighbourhood late at night, refuses to answer my parents' phone calls and last week I caught him leaving his room to pee in the yard where neighbours could see (he outright denied this when questioned about it).

We've recently learned that he's been seeing our family doctor in regards to his mental health and anxiety, but I honestly don't think a general practitioner is best-equipped to provide thorough counselling. My parents went to see the doctor along with my brother, who diagnosed him with anxiety and prescribed him anxiety medication but didn't refer him to a psychologist. I expressed to my parents that I think he really should be seeing a psychologist or a psychiatrist to discuss his self-esteem issues, and possibly address the concerning behaviours he's exhibited recently. But they were happy for him to try out the medication and then see if he needs a psychologist, which I didn't agree with. I feel like they're are scared to acknowledge that he's mentally ill, and think that if they just coddle him some more and provide food, shelter, and a warm bed, that's all he needs to magically emerge from his depression (they constantly talk about how back in their day, they could never be sad if they had a roof over their heads and food to eat).

Sorry for the long post. If anyone's been through therapy or has any advice with this at all, I'd greatly appreciate it. I'm completely lost with what to do.

tldr: Brother (22M) has mental health issues and lies in bed all day. Parents don't believe he has the ability to work so coddle him.",z0syh9,3,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z0syh9/parents_coddle_mentallyill_brother_need_advice/,relationships
388,I(29F) told my boyfriend(25M) we either set hard boundaries with his family or we're done,"So, for context, my boyfriend's family (in particular one very vocal aunt, I'm honestly not sure about the rest) has never liked me. We've been together almost 2 years, lived together for a little over 1 year, so this isn't a new relationship either. Apparently early on, he told her about a fight we had and we believe that's the start of it. Also possibly because when we met I lived in a ""bad area"". Last year around Thanksgiving took the cake. We were planning to do Thanksgiving at our apartment and invite my mom and his dad. I was super excited about it. However, the weekend before we took my younger cousin (whom I helped raise and who is like my own kid) for the weekend. Turns out that after he went back he tested positive for the VID, which meant we had to quarantine and all thanksgiving plans were canceled. Including his plans to go by his aunt's for an hour or so that day. When he was on the phone with his aunt to let her know he couldn't go and why, she said, ""I told you you should have just left her in CITY"". I cried when he hung up the phone. This was when things went downhill fast.

Easter came around and I was out of town visiting my best friend, but his aunt was unaware of this. She invited just him to Easter. He didn't even register this as an issue because I wasn't there - but then I asked if he had told THEM I wasn't going to be there and he said no. So she invited just him assuming I was home. This is when I started being more vocal about it being a bigger issue that needed to be addressed.

In September his grandma passed away. My gut reaction was to not go, and I was open about that with him. However, I asked if he wanted me there and if he'd be upset if I didn't go. He said yes, so I agreed to go. Then we found out it would be a Catholic mass-type service in a church. I'm Pagan and have been for most of my life, and it's a core part of who I am. My religion is important to me. He knows this. So we agreed I could wear an earbud and listen to an audiobook so I didn't have to hear the church stuff and that I wouldn't participate in anything. I told him participating in it was a hard boundary for me, and he honored that. We also agreed I wouldn't go to the get-together that was after the services. We used the excuse that I had to work, which I technically did go home and work. My therapist even agreed it was a good compromise and that it was a big deal that I was willing to set my beliefs aside to support him.

I've gotta break down what happened at the funeral, it'll be important later. Now I'll be upfront - my phone went off during the services. I whispered sorry to everyone SO MANY times until I could get it off. I was extremely embarrassed. However, in reality, could have happened to anyone. I beat myself up for it a bit after, until my boyfriend came back from the get-together and said his dad brought it up, but mostly as a joke about did I listen to heavy metal or something. That was all that was said about it. So that's when I kind of let it slide as just a stupid, embarrassing thing that happened. My boyfriend and I actually saw it happen in a TV show since then and laughed about it happening to me.

During the services, I did text my best friend a few times during the services too when his family or the setting was making me uncomfortable and anxious. I wanted to get up and leave (I actually cried a bit at one point because I was so anxious and uncomfortable) and she talked me down and got me to stay. For 80% of the services, I sat there staring up at the priest of whoever was talking and just listening to my audiobook. I didn't participate in any of the standing up, singing, etc, as agreed upon. And my boyfriend's dad, grandfather, and aunt were in the pew ahead of us, so they couldn't even see me.

Now here we are at Thanksgiving time again. My boyfriend asked his aunt what they were doing so we could figure out our plans. His aunt says we can both come, but if I come it'll make everyone uncomfortable. Apparently, she's upset because I was ""on my phone for the whole service"" and she found it rude. I don't know how she came to this conclusion and my boyfriend (who was next to me the whole time) knows it is an extreme exaggeration at best. I said all I could think of was that it was because I didn't participate, so she assumed I sat on my phone the whole time. There was also this one point where everyone got up to do the communion thing and I was on my phone, yes, but I also felt awkward as hell and that was the point I started crying. His other aunt said something to me, I didn't quite hear her so I asked her to repeat herself, and apparently, she wanted me to move so the grandfather could walk down the pew I was in. I said no problem, got up, and stood at the end, and the grandfather had already just gone down another pew. My boyfriend found me awkwardly standing by the pew when he came back from doing the communion thing and told me to go sit down. Maybe that's where they got me being on my phone the whole time from? I don't even know.

Anyway, this leads to me telling my boyfriend that I need there to be a hard boundary with his family when it comes to holidays/big events. Either we're both fully welcome or neither of us goes. I'm not asking him to go no contact, not asking him to limit contact, etc. I'm totally okay with him seeing his family whenever, this is strictly around holidays/big events. I also said if they ever decide to be more welcoming towards me, I'd be open to reassessing spending holidays with them/splitting them with my family as we had originally wanted. I truly want a good relationship with his family, this aunt just has hated me from the start and seems to be poisoning the well, so to speak.

The thing is, I told my boyfriend that we either put this boundary in place with his family or I can't be with him anymore. However, my best friend said it wasn't right for me to give him an ultimatum and to expect him to side with me over his family, especially when he has a hard time standing up to them. But I'm sick of crying over his family hurting me. I'm sick of being anxious about holidays because they mean stuff like this comes up. I'm sick of the stress and I'm sick of him not standing up to his family more and defending me. Granted, this time he did tell his aunt that that wasn't my religion (regarding the service), so that was actually an improvement. We had agreed previously to not tell her I'm Pagan because we think it would be a new reason for her to have an issue. I should probably add that this aunt helped with raising him so it isn't a typical aunt situation. His aunt, uncle, and grandparents all stepped in a lot to help because of the hours his dad worked.

Is there a way I could have handled this better? Or does anyone have any advice to handle family members of significant others that are like this? Besides this, our relationship is pretty great. I'd hate to give it up because of this, I'm just really struggling with it.

TL;DR: My boyfriend's aunt has never liked me and said it would make everyone ""uncomfortable"" if I came to thanksgiving. So I said we need to have a hard boundary that either we're both welcome to holidays/big events or neither of us goes and if he can't put that boundary in place, we're done. My best friend says I was wrong for doing this. Could I have handled this better?

He stopped talking to me for awhile, wouldn't reply, so I told him I was going to make a life altering decision to get him to stay . I threatened him and honestly I just felt desperate and I was really obsessed with making this work . He eventually told her everything, I think. We are now together, and he already moved in because of his roommate situation, he just couldn't live there anymore. I just wonder if its okay, that I still talk to this other guy that I really clicked with, my boyfriends friends tried telling him about this guy but I just told him it was nothing to worry about because honestly at the time it wasnt. Now we are living together and have a puppy but I don't know how to let him know about the guy I'm falling for now without him losing his temper. I'm still in college, he just moved in and I was happy but I think I was just living in a fantasy. We went to shows together, and the other guy would be texting me that he wants to meet up, I feel like I have been pulling him towards me but now I don't know. I should also mention that my current boyfriend plays music, and I tried to get him on a bill, but then I accidentally fucked it up for him and I just acted like I was shocked by it happening, I have just been trying to find a way out.

390,"I, 45yo m, am having some issues with my wife, 44yo f, of 18 years. I've recently discovered some questionable text conversations she's had and hidden. When I try to have a conversation about something she does that's hurtful she refuses to accept that she's the cause of it. How do I handle this?","My wife and I have been together for 23 years, married for 18.  Most of these years have been fantastic.  About 5 years ago we moved to a new state and from day 2 of being here it seems we've gone steadily downhill.  It's almost as if she's decided she's done with me but she doesn't know how to tell herself that.

I started to notice in her rhetoric and actions that she was starting to push me away a little bit at a time.  She asked me to change certain behaviors like work less and be home more which I did but her pushing me away kept happening.  It got to the point where she even told me she doesn't respect me.  We moved here so I could help my family business as my dad's health was in decline so I worked extremely hard, shouldering that burden, hoping to make a success of it.  In some ways I can look back and see I was career focused and not family focused and can sympathize with some of her points.

I think i'm a good husband and father.  I love my film dearly.  I've never strayed from my vows.  I don't drink or gamble.  I try to live like what I think a good husband should live like.  I'm sure I've failed on some parts but I try to be cognizant of those failures, fix them, and hopefully never repeat them.  

About a year ago my family was gone for a week and I started looking through my wife's book collection, mostly her books about her career amd I came across a journal she had done as a homework assignment.  I thought by looking through her books I would be able to con ect with her a bit more on something she is passionate about amd to be honest I was lonely and wanted to connect to her in some way.  As I started reading this journal it was very bright and happy and reminded me of the girl I fell I love with.  I then got to an entry about her regretting how her and her ex ended and now she lives with regret.  This was written 7 years into our relationship at the time.  Two of those years we had been married.  I found out that during the honeymoon phase of our relationship she regretted where she was and wished that she had a life with her ex.  It hurt so bad to read that, it made me feel our relationship was built on a lie.  Shortly thereafter I brought this up to her and asked her to explaint this to me to which she told me it was an assignment and nothing more and then went on to yell at me for looking thru her journal.  I didn't even know that I was doing anything  wrong.  I didn't know that was private, I just wanted to connect more with her that's all.  What bothered me more though is the way she reacted to me telling her that those words hurt me.  She had no empathy or sympathy that I had just been devastated by what I read instead she got mad and yelled at me stating she did nothing wrong and that it's my problem that I don't believe her.  Her reaction was worse than her words. 

I've heard her belittle me to her family and friends as well, something I don't do with mine.  Her patience with me when I bring up those things that have hurt me is simply not there anymore.  She now says she's over being accused of these things even though in my mind she is totally culpable in those situations.  

In the last few weeks it has been brought toy attention that she has had some questionable texting that she has hidden on her phone which she has become pretty serious about never leaving it just sitting around, she always has it with her.  I know these are red flags.  We've had a happy few months now but I think its possibly a false sense of peace in our house.  It isn't the kind of happy we used to have.  I need to bring these recent revelations I've learned of up to her but I know she will gaslight me and turn this around on me stating she has no fault, did nothing wrong and it's my paranoia ending with her being extremely mad at me for breaking the peace we've had as that's how it's always gone before.  What hurts the most is she claims she never cheats because she remembers how badly it hurt her ex when he found out she had cheated on him but when I bring up things she's done to me that have hurt me the empathy for me is completely absent.  I thought she loved me, she's supposed to be the guardian of my heart, especially after all these years.  I'm so lost about this and am very hurt by it all.  I don't know how to proceed

391,So I've been seeing a seeing F30 and I'm M29 for 3months and she keeps miss reading me,"So I've been seeing a seeing F30 and I'm M29 for about 3 months now and thing on the whole have been great she really gets me and when we are together it's amazing. However when ever we spend time apart she goes silent this is because she needs time to recharge which I totally get as I have had a close friend since a child who really struggles with anxiety who also needs time away from people to recharge so I am happy to give her this space so that I can see her again when she is ready. 

The problem I am seeing arise is that she has been miss reading situations massively the other weekend she came around to my house originally she was going to stay the night as we usually visit each others places like this at the weekend but she told me in the afternoon of the night she was coming over that she would only be coming for the evening and then going home to which I told her was fine and I am happy to see her in what ever amount she feels comfortable with. 

we had a seemingly nice evening we chatted alot about her problems and I made her dinner and we then watched some TV together while cuddling she then left and I kissed her goodbye and we said our good-byes she then stood up to leave and looked at me to say why aren't you getting up I sensed this and apologized walked her to the door and said goodbye again

 the following day I messaged her to check she was ok and received nothing she read my messages and didn't reply so later that evening I sent another message just to ask if anything had happened and too check that she was ok she replied and told me that she felt hurt and that I had been dismissive. 

through this conversation she told me that I had looked uncomfortable when she told me about her darker feelings and this had made her feel rejected she also told me that I had rejected her by not getting up right away after we had said goodbye I apologized and told her that i worry about her because I care and in no way am I rejecting her we had talked through her feelings (which is naturally uncomfortable to talk about someone you care abouts darker side of depression). 

Through out this text conversation she kept picking up on small things and telling me I was rejecting her she was sending alot of messages and it was hard to reply to them all  (I think I missed two messages when replying too one with a long message)this was one of the feelings of rejection she got after several more messages where she mentioned a problem that we have talked about before I tried to open a conversation with her that we have had alot of times about one of her problems (to do with getting the coil implant) and I said in agreement that I was shocked how badly it had effected her she read this as me being dismissive I know she focuses on the granular rather than the whole picture

this was now upsetting me I have been trying really hard to be there for her and have these conversations to help ease her stress but when I try to open a conversation with her about this she tells me I'm being dismissive and don't want the conversation to which I replied admittedly without thinking you can't create your own narrative for my intentions as my intention was to talk about her problem and hopefully help her in some way.

 She then took this statement as an attack and I can see why I could of done Alot better at wording what I meant but I was very tired and felt upset myself as I'd been giving nothing but support and it was being read as the opposite to my intentions I apologized and told her that we need to have this conversation over the phone or in person because of how important tone is it can really change what something means.  

I just don't know where I stand I feel exhausted and it seems no matter what I do it's always read as the worst possible scenario. I don't feel my feelings are being accounted for in this situation as it's almost like being called a liar when you just want to help. 

What's your thoughts Reddit am I in the wrong I have apologized for my statement and told her what I meant by it and organised for us to have a phone call and talk about it I'm just gutted because there is an amazing woman behind this illness and I feel exhausted constantly having to re phrase and carefully construct what I say because I know she can hang off the smallest miss wording and then take the whole conversation as me being negative or dismissive. 

I've explained to her that she needs to communicate with me more if she feels I've hurt her as it's not my intention rather than boiling over it all day because she's usually got the wrong end of the stick and works it up to be way bigger than it is.

How do I get past this?  

TL;DR 
My partner has depression she Is very present when together but rarley replys when we are apart when we have spent time together sometimes only a few hours in a week she miss reads my intentions as me being dismissive when it's the opposite I want to open conversations and help ease her stress I show compassion and it is swept under the carpet to focus on one small statement that has been made.

We had the talk about Grindr and how we felt about being on there and I told him I would delete it. This occurred over phone. He said it was fine if I kept it but I wanted to get his take on how he would feel about boyfriend being on there and have that as an in person talk but I didn’t say this to him but wanted to delete it in front of him. 

He saw me active on Grindr but I was on there because of my own insecurity about seeing him on there as well. But I didn’t see his profile. He confronted me about it and stated that he saw me on there as single. When confronted, I told him exactly that above but he says he doesn’t trust me because of previous experiences. I broke down in front of him and apologized profusely. He says that he wants to be friends and is not sure yet on an answer if we could be a couple. He still wants to see me and has said that he would still have feelings for me. 

I don’t know what to do or what to think. I want there to be something and want to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation and how that has turned out.

393,How do I (35F) deal with a boyfriend (35M) who makes my problems about himself?,"I've been with this guy for like a year. I'm his first real big relationship, he's always been a loner and busy working so he never really dated. Sorry, it's long, a lot of it can just be skimmed for some background. 

Anyway, things were great in the beginning, as they always are. Any time he'd do something seemingly selfish or inconsiderate, I'd chalk it up to him not knowing how to be in a relationship. I'd talk to him about it, explain things and try to teach him. I know we aren't born knowing this stuff. 

But, recently, the last few months, many things in my life have been very stressful. I have many work related injuries that I've gotten over the years and most of them are flaring up at the same time right now, I'm often in extreme pain, it gets in the way of activities I enjoy. I just had surgery to get sterilized as I don't want kids so I've been healing from that for a month or so. I went back to work too soon after so it's taking much longer to heal but I couldn't take more time off. My grandpa is in the hospital and has been for weeks, he has covid, feeding tube problems and other things where he's needed to be intubated and received multiple surgeries, he's not doing very good, I'm very worried. My new puppy hurt himself recently by falling off the couch, I was worried his leg was broken, after an expensive vet visit and proper treatment, he's okay but he would regularly scream in pain until it was healed, it hurt my heart hearing him cry like that, I barely slept. My best friend is going through a divorce and I'm trying to help him and be there for him and I'm so sad this is happening to him. Basically, I'm so stressed, my brain snapped and I ended up with very very bad brain fog for weeks, I could barely drive familiar routes, I couldn't do my hobbies, I couldn't even figure out how to make a Hot Pocket for a snack. My therapist is worried about my depression becoming extra severe and my overall health. My doctor is worried and trying to treat me too.

Anyway, I would, of course, go to my boyfriend about such things. He's my main support as I've been his main support. I've been present for his life problems, listened, offered advice if requested and always been there. But, recently, he told me that things I were telling him were making him sad. He told me I shouldn't have texted him in panic about my injured puppy because it brought his mood down. He's asked me to ""tone down"" the things I tell him because it stresses him out. So I did. I pulled back a bit, I understand not everyone is always able to handle that stuff. But then he got upset that I wasn't talking to him about stuff and he felt like I didn't trust him. So I started talking again but then he told me all I do is take take take from his energy and never give. So I stopped again. (When I say I stopped, I mean I was still present for him and still chatting, I just didn't talk about the stress in my life.) Then, again, he asked why I don't trust him and why I'm not talking about what's going on in my life. He tells me that he's giving and giving and I'm not being thankful and that me still being upset is hurting his feelings. That it makes him feel helpless. 

He told me that my delays in texting while my puppy was injured meant I cared about him less. He said he was jealous. 

I've tried explaining what I'm going through, how his actions make me feel, how I just need a listening ear. I tried saying that I'm at my breaking point and I don't know how I can give more when my brain isn't even wanting to work right due to stress. That I can't do *all* the emotional labor. He says I hurt him by being down and upset and he feels helpless, that me making him feel helpless is a bad thing and my fault and I need to stop. He's even upset that I don't want to do sexy things even though I'm healing from a surgery in that vicinity, in lots of overall pain, very life stressed *and* I'm not feeling loved or respected. He said it's all very hard on him and makes him feel unattractive. Even though I've explained that I think he's attractive, I just can't do that stuff right now, it hurts and I'm not in the mood. He told me that he forgives me for being selfish. 

If I'm hurting or upset, I have to comfort him about it instead of him comforting me. I have to tell him that I'll be okay and that it's all fine, I have to keep myself together, phrase things gently and be sure I don't worry him or make him feel helpless. Otherwise he spirals and  I have to spend *days* comforting him, he'll just be quiet and in a bad mood until I've apologized repeatedly. 

I'm trying to see things from his point of view, that his major support system is faltering badly right now, that he feels like he can't help and the stress that must put him under. Watching someone you care for struggle is really hard. Also, the fact that he's never really gone through this with another person before and it's my job to be patient and walk him through this. I'm trying to hard to keep my feelings put away, I just talk to him about how it's reasonable he's upset. I cheer him up then we chat about normal stuff. I act happy and peppy and make jokes and such. If I don't, if I express stress, I have to be the one to comfort him. It's easier if I just keep it all to myself at this point. 

I *do* have other people I also talk to, he's not just someone I dump everything on, I was just trying to keep him in the loop of my life and be vulnerable with him. He also has lots of friends and family in his life but, early in the relationship, he told me he wouldn't be using them as support anymore because my support was better.

Tl;dr: boyfriend says I'm too much in my stress and I need to tone it down, he says I make him feel helpless and I need to think before I speak to be sure I say things in a way that doesn't make him feel that way. I feel like I should listen to that because I care about his feelings and should be putting them above my own. But I also feel unloved and like I need to walk on egg shells. I don't know what to do.",z0kffe,8,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z0kffe/how_do_i_35f_deal_with_a_boyfriend_35m_who_makes/,relationships
394,My [M21] girlfriend [F21] cheated on me.,"She went on a trip to another state. It was organised by the University and only a handful (about 20) people went. I could not because I had some family matters to attend to.
It was last week and she came back on Friday. We talk every night and throughout the last week, barring two days, we still did. She told me everything and did mention that she is getting close to a guy. She told me then that they had gone to a rooftop and talked about life and stuff and I was happy for her. She usually never socialises and doesn't have many friends.
Fast forward to Saturday morning, she tells me that she kissed the guy, and he kissed her first (on the neck and then she went for the lips). It started with a hug. Then she tells me that being close meant holding hands, waist, kissing in the forehead and once she even slept with him (they didn't do anything, just slept, and there were other people there as well)
She did tell me that she missed me everyday and she wished I was with her. 
But she also told me that these moments that she spent with a guy, she didn't want to cheat on me, but they meant something to her. So far, when i ask her why, her answer is “I don't know.”
She wants to keep talking to the guy too.

She is my first girlfriend in college, same class and she has confessed to me that she had wanted to kiss another guy while texting with him at 2 am.

I guess this is all. What do you think? What should I do?

395,My gf is not sure about our relationship,"TL,DR: Me and my gf have been dating for a couple of months and she is entirely sure she wants a relationship right now due to the many changes in her life.

My GF is not entirely sure about our relationship

So i (23M) have been dating my (24F) girlfriend for a couple of months, we’ve been exclusive a little over a month and she officially became my girlfriend two weeks ago. 

It started pretty great, we’ve both been to therapy and know how to communicate well, we tell each other out feelings and all of that good stuff, that’s why the other day she confessed that she’s not sure she is ready for another relationship.

She recently moved, she had a new job, and a puppy arrived to her life, all of this in the span of 2 months, she is overwhelmed with her life and the fact that she has had so many changes lately.

She is concerned about our different lifestyles, i am a freelancer and she has a 9-5 and her pase of work is very fast, she thinks this could be an issue, she’s also worried about us spending too much time together since that was an issue on her last relationship (2 years ago)

Couple that with the while overwhelmed things and she just said she doesn’t know if she’s ready. She says that she loves me but that it seems that i arrived at a chaotic time in her life.

We agreed to continue dating and see how we feel down the line. I am sad and i feel not wanted or loved. Am i doing the right thing in waiting or should i end the relationship. Could she be playing games? Idk man

396,My (45F) Husband (45m) Doesn’t want to take my money to send His Daughter to College,"Hi all, 

My husband, “Chris,” and I have been married for 12  years. We have two daughters together (6 and 4F). Chris has three children from his previous relationship (17F, 16M, 14M). Their mother is a very mentally unwell person and I have been in their lives since his oldest was 5. Their kids are low contact with their mother and spend the bulk of their time with me and Chris. I am definitely their step mother and they call me by my first name, but I love them like I do my biological daughters. 

Chris’s oldest daughter, “Leah,” is a senior in high school and just got into her top college early decision. The university’s yearly tuition runs nearly 60k before piling everything else on top. To put it bluntly, Chris cannot afford that and Leah’s mother will not be helping.

I come from money, but Chris has always refused to take a cent from me or my family. My father set up trust funds for our daughters when they were infants, and Chris was furious when he found out and told me my father was never to set up trusts for his children with his first wife. His children know my parents are wealthy, but they aren’t aware that I have access to it and think we’re upper middle class. I think it comes from a place of insecurity that I have more money than him, so I never bring it up. 

When Leah got into the university, she was thrilled. Chris was quick to tell her he couldn’t afford to send her there, so she would have to take out loans. Like I said, I love Leah like my own and don’t wish mountains of debt on her. I quietly told Chris that I could cover what he couldn’t afford. He said no. I told him I would loan him the money and he could pay me back and he refused. When I told him it wasn’t fair for Leah to be saddled with all that debt when there was a way out, he said he’s never taken a cent from me, won’t start now, and that it would teach her responsibility. 

Personally, I think Chris is being ridiculous and immature. This is supposed to be a happy time in Leah’s life, and she’s stressing about paying off loans that she shouldn’t have to take. What do you think I should do in this situation? I’m not letting her take those loans out. Is there a way to get my husband to back down here? He’s letting his ego hurt his daughter’s future. 

TL;DR: my step daughter just got into a college that my husband can’t afford and will have to take out loans. I have the means to pay for her college without loans and my husband is refusing. What should I do?",yzttq0,363,237,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/yzttq0/my_45f_husband_45m_doesnt_want_to_take_my_money/,relationships
397,"My narcissistic ex boyfriend cheated on me and lied to Me , how can I move past this ??","He lied and gas lit me SO bad. I just found out today that the last two weeks he's started hanging out with his ex gf again. He lied about her too. He lied and told me it was his cousin he was hanging out with and of course he gas lit me when I said I didn't believe him. He said ""I can't even take my cousin out without you flipping out on me"" and he made ME apologize. Then today I find out through a friend who was hanging with his ex today, that they've been out for dinner a couple times and that he's been begging for her back . He told her everything he told me... he told us both that he wanted to take us on vacation, and he told me he was falling for me etc... how can you say these types of things to two separate people at the same time??

He told her today when she and I found out that I'm a psychopath and he's been trying to ghost me and that he only took me out for coffee, and now I'm the physcopath who got In the way of him being with the girl that ""he actually loves"" (his ex). He told her that I won't leave him alone and that I called him last night and asked him to come over tonight..  i sent her screenshots showing that he made me apologize for thinking he was with another girl when he was actually with her ; I showed her that he actually called me , and that he even texted me saying ""I'll come see you tomorrow"". Then he says to her that I just won't get it through my skull and that he hasn't been pursuing me..  when he just got back from being away for work for more than 2 weeks and was texting me all these nice things... saying how excited he was to see me and that he was coming straight to my house when he got back.

Then his flight got delayed and he started drinking..  so I questioned why he needed to get drunk at 9 in the morning, and he completely lost it on me.. calling me names and telling me to grow the f*** up and that no one would ever love me and he's sick of my feelings always being hurt and he has better things to do. (He told her tonight om the phone when she was recording him that he also doesn't feel like putting up with her always being upset)... yet to me it seems like he's the one hurting everyone and he can never be at fault?? He always told me that tbey broke up because they constantly argued.. then blamed me that we argued lots (when i told him I am not an arguer and that I've never argued so much with any of my exs... he still told me it's my fault that we re arguing and that I need to work on myself and take on responsibility and the fact that we argue this much because it's my fault)..

Now he's gone and unadded me on everything , after he told her he had ""already blocked me"" (he actually only just unadded me on social media , Im the one who actually followed through and blocked him). He stopped responding to me when they were on the phone arguing and i haven't heard from him since..

I cannot believe how much this guy can lie directly to my face but yet he would always say that I'm a liar and I'm the crazy one and tells his ex that he's been trying to ghost me...meanwhile he's trying to plan a vacation with me and he even had me as his background on his phone and on his Apple watch and she saw that and asked who I was... now since she found out , he's stopped replying to me and I have no closure at all , just left here crying with no answers and just a broken heart...

How can I move past this? It hurts so bad . I've never seen anyone lie to this degree and manipulate two people , all the while we both have proof of his straight up lies !!!! 

I should have known when he got verbally abusive with me too, and even told me the other day that I'm ""lucky that he didn't toss me like a piece of paper across the room and it's a good thing he's not abusive otherwise he would have"". But him just telling me he would do so if he wasn't abusive made me think that he actually would toss me like a piece of paper If he could. 

We talked on the phone every night that he was at work... I wish I knew sooner because otherwise i wouldn't have tolerated his emotional abuse (not that i should have from the beginning anyways..).. but he always made me feel like i wasn't good enough for him and that I needed to work on myself because otherwise no one will ever love me :( he knew I struggle with severe depression , he met my parents, stayed at my house for days at a time and now he's telling her that he loves her and i just got in the way because of my craziness.... 

Someone please tell me how to stop this heartbreak over someone as terrible as him??? 

I hope she doesn't get back with him either... but watch.. he will get what he wants and I'll just be the gum on the bottom of his shoes that he used to get her back


TL;DR

How do I stop the heart ache of being lied to by a master manipulator after his ex and I found out he's been leading us both on, and he's told her that he ghosted me and that we only went on a coffee date, when just the other day he was talking about taking Me on vacation etc... and staying at my house and calling me every single night... please help:(",z0sena,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z0sena/my_narcissistic_ex_boyfriend_cheated_on_me_and/,relationships
398,I M17 broke up with my now ex girlfriend F16 after 6 months on my birthday,"I M16 at the time had my first ever relationship this year with F16. At the start I thought things were going great, and we had a good time. Since it was the first relationship for both of us, and we were both pretty shy, things developed rather slowly but from the beginning on she never really did anything for us. 

Sometimes we wouldnt see each other for weeks, except in school. But since I had no experience I just shrugged it off and treated it as if it were normal. I only started to think about it when she told me after 5 months of being together that she feels uncomfortable even hugging me. It is not like she just doesnt like being all touchy and cuddly with others. She was like that all the time with her best friends but never with me. That really hit me and made me think about how the relationship was going. She was also really manipulative. Never telling me whats wrong and getting mad, if Id ask too much but also getting mad, if I didnt ask and things like that. So i slowly came to realize that it probably wasnt a good idea to keep the relationship going. 

At that time, my birthday was right around the corner and of course she was invited. I told her, Id feel better if she didnt show up but I said it in a nice way, as to not hurt her more than needed. I didnt hate her or dislike her much at that time but that would change very quickly. She told her best friends, who also happen to be good friends of mine to not show up to my party, because she couldnt and to cut contact with me. Now she is going around spreading rumors about how I am telling lies to get everyone to side with me. I seriously didnt expect her to be like that but in the end I think I made the right decision. 
What do you guys think?

Now, I'm starting to develop feelings for her and I'm thinking of trying to get this friendship going somewhere further. But. Yesterday, my ex texted me, that she was really sorry and she was wrong and telling me she wants to get back with me. still have feelings left for my ex and since it wasa 3 years relationship, would've never hesitated to go back and fix stuff with her. But, nowI have this girl started to develop feels with. To make this even complicated, my ex doesn't particularly like me talking to her and started to do that more when I broke up with her. So now, I'm stuck in a situation where should go back with my ex and kind of dtich the feelings and friendship with my other friend or, just say no to my ex and risk my next relationship with that girl, because don't know if she likes me or not. 

TLDR: broke up with my ex, got a new friend, but ex want to get back with me, and need to choose between ex or my new friend who I developed bit of feelings towards

400,"I resent my husband for maturing it to being a good man and a good father, I want the bad boy I met in my teens.","I know this is going to sound terrible and I know im going to get an awful lot of hate but I need to get it off my chest so I thought I’d create a throwaway. 

Me and my husband met in our late teens. I’m 37 he’s 38. We both hung around a bad crowd and I got up to some stuff but he was always well behaved despite hanging around some wrong uns. His friends even gave him the nickname “soap” like the character from Lock Stock who isn’t a criminal despite hanging around criminals. 

When I was younger I loved a bad boy and that’s what first attracted to hanging around with my husband and his friends. They were the toughest lot at school and that continued after we left school. They would sell drugs and stolen goods and all drove nice cars. My husband was an apprentice baker at the time and he was definitely good looking and had that rough look about him but he did really well at school and could have gone to practically any uni in the UK but didn’t want to sit a classroom anymore. He was the perfect blend of bad boy and safety. 

We got together and his friends were in and out of prison and the police took a particular interest in my husband thinking that he was some higher up criminal because he wasn’t getting caught. Truth was he wasn’t getting caught because he wasn’t doing anything. I can remember not long after we moved in together the police raided our flat and dragged him away in cuffs and I’ll admit I loved the neighbours seeing that happen, thinking that we were some sort of gangster couple. Especially when all his friends came round that night to celebrate him being released with no charge. 

Anyway as the years have gone on I’ve started to see a softening in the way my husband acts and talks that matches his personality more. He dresses more plainly and still has the tattoos but doesn’t wear the jewellery, shaved his head now as he’s going bald, still looks after himself but he goes cycling and plays tennis now rather than boxing and lifting weights. It’s started to really turn me off him. I don’t want a soft man I want a tough guy. He’s tall as well, 6’2 but acts like a mouse. 

He still has the same group of friends but my husband looks so out of place when they take group photos or hang out I get embarrassed by him. This sounds so stupid typing it out but I get jealous of the other wives and girlfriends going to visit their men in prison. One of his friends got a long time in prison and me and my husband both write to him separately as I knew him first and my husband even allowed me to post him a few naughty pictures of myself but even that turns me off because I think a real man wouldn’t want his wife doing that! A real man would get mad at me and mad at his friend not take the fucking photos to send him! 

The final straw came yesterday when I knew I had to do something about this. One of his friends girlfriends came to see us today and brought her young daughter along to play with our daughter. While we were talking the girls went in to the kitchen and were talking to my husband. When we realised they’d been gone a while we went to check them and found the three of them baking cookies together. The girls were loving it and were laughing and cutting shapes in the dough to bake and they ended throwing flour at my husband covering him and he scooped them up in each arm and they all ended up covered in flour. My friend took a photo and put it on Insta saying how much the girls loved baking with him.

Everyone comment saying how sweet it was etc. i just wanted to vomit and couldn’t stand to be near him to the point I made up a lie about my work ringing me so I could leave the house. I feel terrible for being so repulsed by him being a good guy! When I got home we got in to bed and he tried it on but I wasn’t in the mood and said no and he said no problem and even that pissed me off. I wanted him to fight for my affection and not take no for an answer! 

How do I get past this? Can I get past this? Do I leave him and let him get with someone he deserves and me get with someone who I want to be with? Or do I stay and hope these feelings surpass?

402,Can I trust my girlfriend who is still in contact with her ex and many casual partners on social media?,"I (m;46) am in a relationship with a woman (f;38) for the last 15 months. 

We first met through work years ago. I developed feelings for her at that time but never expressed them because she was involved with someone else. We kept in touch in a friendly and professional manner down through the years, infrequently and because she was in a long term relationship for several years.

Our opportunity to be together came out of the blue. She moved back to her home state about two years ago and after reconnecting I paid her a visit and we spent a couple of weeks together. Our relationship moved quickly but we developed a strong connection. After five months I relocated and moved in with her. We started a business together. 

We generally have grown in our relationship but it has not been without problems. There has and still is incongruity as far as attitudes to sex and past relationships.  I guess I was a little wary from the outset because she had emotional baggage from the previous three or four years. 

She was open with me about this, which I appreciated. However, aspects of her history were alarming and threw up red flags for me. She had an affair with a married man that commenced on a while she was not fully out of her long term relationship. She claimed that he lied about his status at the time. However, they reconnected two years later when she moved to his city for another job and became involved again despite knowing he had not separated. Relaying this tale to me, she seemed bitter about the fact he chose to stay with his family as opposed to the damage and hurt she contributed to.

Before she moved there, she took a six month career break travelling overseas. This seems to have been a period of promiscuity or as she had at least 10 hookups during that time; with three guys in a two week period. Many of these hook ups are still her connections on social media. One ex from a few years back whom she dated for six or seven months still carries a torch for her. She told me that he was really only a FWB but turns out she travelled on a skiing trip with him in the first few months of their relationship. He travelled to meet up with her on her travels and visited her a couple of times in the last few years before we connected. She told me that they still talk once in a while. She still has chats with him on Instagram. I know this because I saw some of the chats when I used her laptop and she failed to close the app. There seems to be a connection between them that verges on intimacy. She sent messages and had banter with him during the period when I first spent time visiting her at the start of her relationship. A few months back she  discussed family issues with him and during a period of anxiety he offered to be there for her. This evolved into his suggestion on his part they spend a holiday together and weekends away. He lives in a different state so there is no physical opportunity to meet practically. She did not seem to be flirtatious whereas he was, but she used a lot of heart emojis in response to his sweet talking.  What bothered me was that she responded that she would love to get away but that  her boyfriend would not appreciate it as much (followed by see no evil monkey face). She had other IG messages from other travel hookups, again they were being flirtatious looking for validation. Some she mentioned that she had a boyfriend. 

I have told her about my discomfort with this. I cannot understand the need to keep in contact at this level with random casual relationships from the past. I suspect she is keeping in touch with the guy who invited her away as a back burner option. I told her it seems disloyal to me, I would expect her to distance herself from someone who is obviously trying to resurrect their past relationship and maintain the connection, if she was truly committed to me. I told her it feels disrespectful to me. She told me that she doesn't have feelings for him beyond care and friendship. 

I am confused. Some parts of this are things I need to resolve. There is an aspect of retrospective jealousy on my part. There may be esteem issues; at the moment it's a bad period financially and career wise and my confidence is a bit low.

However some of it comes down to personality and character and personal morals. I did find the promiscuity and affair disturbing especially as it was relatively recent, three to four years ago. Her timelines suggest emotional cheating and even physical cheating during relationship cross overs in the past. Some aspects of this suggest narcissistic traits. 

She does care and loves me. However, I sometimes wonder that I have invested more in the relationship, having moved cross state for her.

I love this woman very much and I want the relationship to work but my gut feeling is that she can compartmentalize relationships and feelings in a way that I find unsettling and that she is hanging onto this guy as a life raft for a future hookup or relationship in case it doesn't work out with me. It is making me hold affection back sometimes and is creating distrust.

403,Mum (60) is really upset because daughter (30) asked her to not use ‘you’ve lost some weight” as a compliment.,"**tldr:**: mum says to people oh you look great have you lost some weight. Sister brought up that it made her feel uncomfortable and it’s better to compliment something else about a person. Mum doesn’t really understand why this is an issue And is really upset and feeling kind of victimised/unable to take responsibility.

My mum (60) has this thing where she will say, “oh you look great, have you lost some weight?’.

She believes that she is complimenting someone and doesn’t mean to do it in a rude way. However she has mentioned it a couple of times recently to my sister recently and my sister is feeling uncomfortable about it. She wished that mum wouldn’t focus on this stuff and would find another compliment that doesn’t focus on weight. She also feels like mum is doing this because my sister is bigger that she has been bmi still well within normal (i understand bmi isn’t the greatest) but the point is she feels like mum is saying it because of that.

My sister brought this up with my mum about how she feels uncomfortable and would Prefer mum to say something else.

My mum brought this up with me and was so distraught and crying. I said to her I understand she is upset but it’s a learning opportunity and time to self reflect and think about what you can say to people. I said we knew she meant it in a nice way and it wasn’t malicious or rude but that doesn’t mean to say she can‘t change the way she compliments people. I brought up how people can loose weight for a variety of reasons some can be negative, you don’t want to make people feel like their appearance is tied to their worth, about how society values body size I also gave her examples of things she could say instead.

It took a while but mum eventually agreed although I feel like she doesn’t understand, she was so upset and she kept getting really defensive and saying well what should I say instead (in a defensive tone), well people are soft these days etc etc.

I was quite taken a back at how defensive she was.

How can I help my mum understand this And that it’s ok for people to say their concerns etc and that it’s not victimising/attacking anyone. We want to be able to be open with mum but she makes it hard because know anything thats seen as a criticism will be met with an inability to deal with it and understand it and just have a victim mentality. I don‘t mind her being upset as I am the same however I understand and see things from the perspective and understand what I can do to change etc if someone was to bring something up like that.",z0u2qv,0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z0u2qv/mum_60_is_really_upset_because_daughter_30_asked/,relationships
404,Bf (27M) of 9 months didn't get me (27F} anything for my bday and blamed it on his depression,"It was my birthday yesterday and while I wasn't expecting anything big (boyfriend can't afford much), I was hoping for something small to show his appreciation for me. He came over after I asked him to and he brought me a gift that his mom bought for me. While this was thoughtful of her, I would've much rather gotten a gift from my boyfriend instead. The least he could've done was given me a nice birthday card or some baked goods, but he didn't. I asked him why he couldn't do the bare minimum for me and he just blamed it on being broke, procrastination and his depression. He scrambled to write me a birthday card on a piece of scrap paper after I got upset with him, but I told him not to bother with it.

Later on, we got into an argument after I told him that his lack of effort made me feel like he didn't care about me. At one point, he had a veeery agitated, scary look on his face so I blurted ""you look like you want to punch me."" He said yes, which was shocking. As a trauma response (from being physically abused in the past), I impulsively punched myself in the face because in my mind "" if I do it for him, he doesn't have to think about or potentially do it at any point."" Is this a sign of potential abuse down the line?  I'm not sure what to do going forward

tl;dr: My bf's mom got me a gift instead of my bf doing it himself. The least I expected out of him was a heartfelt bday card especially since I put in quite a bit more effort on our special days. This resulted in an arguement that led to him essentially admitting that he felt like punching me. After things cooled down, he apologized and claims that he didn't really mean it.

405,"I (M27) think my fiancee (F26) just insulted me, Should I Tell Her..","SITH that she insulted me? 

Earlier tonight me (M27) and my fiance (F26) were playing Would You Rather laying down on the bed after a long day at our office, we were going along the game laughing it off like two childrens on a sleepover.

We were close friends before she decided to date me, it was four days in before we were engaged and three months into our relationship, we're supposedly be married by next month.. 

But few questions into the game she suddenly came up with a ""would rather have a nice ass, not like that roman statue ass or would you rather have a nice chest?""..
little background is that my fiance has a lean petite athletic body while I'm flabby, chubby, you name it... she have expressed multiple times she's not looking for a partner that's just fit anymore and she likes my physique just fine. 

I was stunned (still smiling) stuck in head for the longest thirty seconds I had experienced, overthinking if she was referring her disgust of my body or she just have general distaste of roman statues sitting muscles.

406,My mom (44f) just came out as a lesbian,"My mom (44f) and my dad (50m) are going through a divorce and she has just moved out. She moved in with a woman Carrie (34f) who I have now found out is her girlfriend. She told me (14f) and my brother (16m) that she is a lesbian and that was the reason she and dad were getting divorced.


I just don’t know how to feel. I feel like I should be angry but I just can’t. She had been with Carrie before the divorce and I feel like I should be pissed at my mom and Carrie but I can’t bring myself to.


My brother is saying that she is our mom and that her sexuality has nothing to do with us but I don’t know if I should hate her. On one hand I feel like I should because she did cheat but on the other she is still my mom. Can anyone help me I really need it.


Can anyone give me advice on how to handle this cause I genuinely don’t know what to do?

407,Bfs bad mood is super hard,"My (27f) boyfriend (29m) have a pretty good relationship but things have become pretty hard. Lately, he’s been really stressed with his work and deadlines. He works freelance / works for himself in music, so he doesn’t have the benefit of a lot of security and has to get things done himself. However, whenever he’s stressed, it proceeds to ruin our entire weekend. 

This past weekend for example: he slept over Friday night, and Saturday morning we planned to go out for breakfast and then on a couple hour nature walk. We went for breakfast and he barely spoke to me. Sounded like a zombie, gave one word answers. It was overall uncomfortable. When we left he said he didn’t feel up for the hike, so we went home and sat on the couch in silence. He revealed to me that work is so on his mind, that it was interfering with being able to be present at breakfast and was sorry about that. I told him it was no worries, and we proceeded to have a somewhat normal day of doing nothing and lounging. 

Sunday we woke up and he was extremely anxious. I asked if he would be down to go to this outdoor / indoor market (antique shop / market) place that we’d talked about going to before. He said okay, but didn’t speak the entire drive down. When we got there, we walked around and he was so unenthused. Like… I’d say “that’s cool!” And he’d go “ya”. He wasn’t mean, just like completely blah and gloomy. I felt uncomfortable. 

After this I just said “ok how about I just drive you home so you can work?” And on the way home he apologized again, saying his stress is really getting to him. We talked about it and it was okay. 

The only problem is this is happening more and more often. We either stay in and he’s gloomy and sad, or we go out and he’s gloomy and sad. I’ve tried having deep talks about it / help how I can. He’s in therapy for his stress management. But it’s become insecure for me to hangout with my partner and have nothing to talk about, him being in a miserable mood. 

What do I do? I love him a lot and he’s assured he loves me and wants the relationship, and his moods have nothing to do with me. Admittedly I do sort of take them on and take it personally? But it’s hard not to when you’re on a date that should be romantic and the person is unresponsive and visibly feeling low.
