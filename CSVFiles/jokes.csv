1,"Let's discuss spam, spammers, and the spamming spammers who spam.","What did the moderator say to the subscribers?

Nobody knows, because nobody ever reads what moderators write.

------

Yes, it was a bad joke, but at least it wasn't a repost... which is *kind of* what we're here to discuss today:

As many of you are no doubt aware, spammers and bad actors have been flooding Reddit lately, and /r/Jokes has started to get hit pretty hard. Dealing with the issue isn't as easy as it sounds, though, because any action that we take has the potential to affect good-faith users. Still, we've been discussing the problem, and we've come up with the beginnings of a solution: 

We're going to ban every last one of our subscribers.

Just kidding! In fact, we're going to give you a bit more insight into how spammers work, what their goals are, and why they're so effective on Reddit. This information will be included on [our complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/wiki/index), which we've also streamlined and updated. (The rules themselves haven't changed; we've just made them a bit clearer and more condensed.) Our hope is that you'll be able to recognize and report spammers when you see them, which will help us keep them from gaining more of a foothold here.

We'll be taking some other anti-spam actions behind the scenes, so rest assured, we aren't trying to dump the spam-fighting on you. We just figured that it was better to keep everyone informed... because after all, /r/Jokes is a community, and a community is only as smart as its dumbest member.

(Yes, the moderators count as members, and yes, we're easily the dumbest.)

Thank you for reading, and remember to report spam when you see it!",vwt4nl,908,125,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/vwt4nl/lets_discuss_spam_spammers_and_the_spamming/,jokes

17,There was a man who worked for the Post Office whose job was to process all the mail with illegible addresses…,"One day, a letter came addressed in shaky handwriting to God with no actual address. He thought he should open it to see what it was about. The letter read:
 
“Dear God,

I am an 83-year-old widow, living on a very small pension. Yesterday someone stole my purse. It had $100 in it, which was all the money I had until my next pension payment. Next Sunday is Christmas, and I had invited two of my friends over for dinner. Without that money, I have nothing to buy food with, have no family to turn to, and you are my only hope. Can you please help me? 

Sincerely, Edna”
 
The postal worker was touched.  He showed the letter to all the other workers. Each one dug into his or her wallet and came up with a few dollars.  By the time he made the rounds, he had collected $96, which they put into an envelope and sent to the woman.

The rest of the day, all the workers felt a warm glow thinking of Edna and the dinner she would be able to share with her friends. Christmas came and went. A  few days later, another letter came from the same old lady to God.

All the workers gathered around while the letter was opened. It read:
 
“Dear God,

How can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me? Because of your gift of love, I was able to fix a glorious dinner for my friends. We had a very nice day and I told my friends about your wonderful gift. By the way, there was $4 missing. I think it might have been those bastards at the post office.

She says ""sure, no problem, I am on hole 8, which means you are on hole 7."" He politely thanks her and they carry on. Towards the end of the course, the man forgets what hole he is on again, so once again, he asks the lady on the hole in front of him which hole she is on. She says she is on hole 18, so he is on the hole behind her, which is 17. He thanks her again and they finish their game. Afterwards, the man heads to the club house to get a drink and relax and he sees the woman there. He approaches her and says ""hey, let me buy you a drink to show my appreciation for your help today..' to which she responds ""alright, sure!"" So they have a drink or two and get to talking and he asks the lady ""so what do you do for a living?"" She responds, ""I'm in sales, what about yourself?"" He says, ""I am also in sales, what is it that you sell?"" She replies ""well if I tell you, you are going to laugh!"" He rejects this notion and says ""I surely won't!"" So she tells him ""I sell tampons."" He falls out of his chair laughing, and she says ""see! I told you that you would laugh!!"" And he says back ""I'm not laughing at that, I sell toilet paper so once again I am still a hole behind you!""

“All right, I can see from your tax returns that you make $500,000 a year, but you’re not giving any money to charity!” he told her. “Now, I happen to run a very credible charity, and…oh look! I live right next door. Tell you what: you write me a check for $1,000 right now to help my charity, and then I promise I’ll leave you alone.”

The politician gasped, very offended. “You think I have money just sitting around to give to charity?” she said. “Were you aware that last year, my father lost his house in a fire, and everything he owned along with it?”

“Um, I didn’t,” said her neighbor.

“And did you also know that my daughter got into a horrible car accident last year, having medical bills several times her annual wages?” she went on.

“Er…no, I’m sorry…”

“And that my sister had her husband walk out on her, leaving her penniless with three children?”

42,Did you ever hear of Juan the Magnificent?,"Juan was just a young man growing up in rural Mexico. He felt he had little chance to grow up and do anything of importance or recognition. He'd grow up and work the land. The same as his father and his grandfather before him.


Until the day he saw the great magician Harry Houdini.


Then young Juan knew his destiny.


Time passed and Juan slowly learned the art of magic. First pleasing friends and family with simple sleight of hand, before going on to grow older and begin entertaining patrons of the local bars with illusions and escapology.


By the time he was 20 he had toured through all of Mexico. From Aguascalientes to Zacatecas and all places inbetween. His fame in the country of his home soon brought a talent scout from America seeking him out.


Before he knew it, Juan the magnificent was on a whirlwind tour of the US, Europe and beyond treading the very same boards that his inspiration Harry Houdini once stodd upon.


This went on for some time, until Juan reached the mid point of his life, when he soon saw dwindling numbers in his audience. The cheers were not so loud and his fame had begun to fade.


Juan needed a new trick.


The next great trick.


It would be his greatest achievement. His crowning glory. His final act. The one they would speak about for generations to come.


As Juan passed his 63rd birthday, the stage was set. The final performance of the legendary Juan the Magnificent. One night only. 
The theatre was sold out. People in every seat. People stood in the aisles and sat upon the floors eager to see this last performance.


The lights dimmed and the orchestra began to play. The curtains opened slowly revealing Juan the Magnificent. He stood in the middle of the stage, dressed in the finest black silk three piece suit, his top hat upon his head.


The stage lights came up, and with a dramatic flourish Juan the Magnificent swept his hat off his head and stood, arms outstretched as the crowd roared with delight. 


Juan the Magnificent stood and basked in the warmth their cheers gave him. As the cheers softened and eventually quitened, Juan the Magnificent took a grateful bow.

Juan the Magnificent, straightened. Placed his hat back upon his head and cried out

""UNO! DOS!""

The man continues to explore the colony's facilities. He enters the sauna and, as he sits down, he farts...

Within minutes, a huge, hairy man lumbers out of the steam-room toward him, 'Did you call for me?' says the hairy man.

'No, what do you mean?' says the newcomer.

'You must be new,' says
the hairy man, 'it's a rule that if you fart, it implies that you called for me.' The huge man easily spins him around, bends him over a bench and has his way with him.

The newcomer staggers back to the colony office, where he is greeted by the smiling, naked receptionist, 'May I help you?' she says.

The man yells, 'Here's my membership card. You can have the key back and you can keep the £500 membership fee.'

'But, Sir,' she replies, 'you've only been here for a few hours. You haven't had the chance to see all our facilities.'

The usual signs...phone rings, but if I answer, the caller hangs up. My wife has been going out with the girls a lot recently, although when I ask their names she always says, ""Just some friends from work, you don't know them.""r>
I sometimes stay awake to look out for her cab coming home, but she always comes walking up the drive as I hear the sound of a car leaving, around the corner, as if she has gotten out and walked the rest of the way. Why? Maybe she wasn't in a taxi at all?

I once picked up her cell phone, just to see what time it was. This caused her to go completely berserk. She quickly snatched the phone out of my hand and cursed me hysterically, screaming that I should never touch her personal property, then accused me of trying to spy on her.

Anyway, I have never broached the subject with my wife. I think deep down I just didn't want to know the truth, but last night she went out again and I decided to really check on her. I decided I was going to park my Harley Davidson Lowrider next to the garage and then hide behind it so I could get a good view of the street around the corner when she came home.

The night was rolling on, and no car went by. The storm was so strong he could hardly see a few meters ahead of him.

Suddenly through the swirling rain Bill saw a car slowly coming towards him.  And as it drew level with him, it stopped.

Desperate for shelter and without really thinking about what he was doing, Bill got into the back seat of the car and closed the door.  That was when he realized there was nobody behind the wheel and the engine wasn't even on!

Mysteriously and soundlessly, the car started moving slowly forward.  Bill looked at the road and saw a curve approaching.  Now he was scared, and he began to fear for his  life.  But just before he reached the curve, a ghostly hand appeared  through the window of the car, and turned the steering wheel.

Bill, paralysed with terror, watched how the hand appeared every time they came to a curve.

When he saw the lights of a pub down the road, Bill gathered all  his bravery and strength, jumped out of the car, and ran to to the pub.

Wet and out of breath, he rushed inside and asked for two shots of scotch.  Shaking  and half crying, he began telling everybody about the horrible  experience he had just been through.  A silence enveloped everybody when they realized he was  not drunk, but was for real.

About 10 minutes later, two guys walked into the same pub. They were also wet, and were out of breath. Looking around and seeing Bill sobbing at the bar, one said to the other, ""Hey Bruce… that's the idiot who got in the car while we were pushing it.""",yzxv6r,533,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/yzxv6r/a_modern_day_ghost_story/,jokes

with no luck getting their attention, the man outside decided to knock on the second house. There he knocked and finally could ask for help towing his car. the man also explained the homeowner what he had seen the first house he came to ask for help.

334,A politician dies,"So a politician dies and ends up standing in front of the pearly gates. Saint Peter looks at him for a second, flicks through his book, and finds his name.  


""So, you're a politician..."" ""Well, yes, is that a problem?"" ""Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!""  


""Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??"" says the politician. ""Them's the rules"" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears...  


And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?  


""Open your eyes!"" says a voice. ""C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!"". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. ""Who are you??"" The politician asks. ""Well, I'm Satan!"" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. ""Welcome to Hell!"" ""Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?"" he asks. Satan throws him a wink. ""Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside..."" Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. ""It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!"" says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep...  


And is woken up by St Peter. ""So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?"" ""No sir!"" says the man. ""So then"" says St Peter ""you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on"". ""Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell"" says the politician. ""Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!"" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.  


The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. ""What's this??"" He cries. ""Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???""  


""Ah"", says Satan. ""You see, yesterday, we were campaigning. But today, you voted...""",yz7n8e,21445,410,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/yz7n8e/a_politician_dies/,jokes

Johnny replies, “Sold them to my friend for $1,000.”

His father is frustrated. “That’s terrible to overcharge your friends like that.  That is way more than those two things cost. I will have to take you to  church and make you confess.”

They go to church and his father alerts the priest, and makes the

In a trial, a Southern small-town prosecuting attorney called his first witness, a grandmotherly, elderly woman to the stand. 

He approached her and asked, 

\- ""Mrs. Jones, do you know me?"" 

She responded, 

\- ""Why, yes, I do know you, Mr. Williams. I've known you since you were a boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you.""

The lawyer was stunned. 

Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, 

\- ""Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?""

She again replied, 

\- ""Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster, too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. One of them was your wife. Yes, I know him.""

The defense attorney nearly died.

The old timer nods knowingly and says, ""Well son, see that barrel over there in the corner?

He starts to feel a little blood flow, looks around to see no one is about, and says 'why not?' to himself.  


Down goes the zipper of his coveralls and he pops his dick into the hole on the barrel. The barrel starts giving him the best blowjob he's ever had and he's in bliss as his eyes roll back into his head.  


An hour later he runs back to the barrel for round two.  


That evening in the galley, the new guy excitedly sits down next to the old-timer, ""I used the barrel twice and it was great! I'm going to use it every day now! No more frustrations on this old oil rig!"" and smiles to himself.

433,Sisters,"

A man is driving down a deserted stretch of highway when he notices a sign out of the corner of his eye. It says, 'Sisters of Mercy House of Prostitution 15 mi.’

He thinks it was just a figment of his imagination and drives on without a second thought.   

Soon, he sees another sign that says, 'Sisters of Mercy House of Prostitution 8 mi’ and realizes that these signs are for real. 

When he drives past a third sign saying, 'Sisters of Mercy House of Prostitution Next Right' his curiosity gets the better of him and he pulls into the drive.  

On the far side of the parking lot is a somber stone building with a small sign next to the door saying, 'Sisters of Mercy'.   

He climbs the steps and rings the bell.   

The door is answered by a nun in a long black habit who asks, 'What may we do for you, my son?’

'He answers, 'I saw your signs along the highway and was interested in possibly doing business.

''Very well, my son. Please follow me.’   

He is led through many winding passages and is soon quite disoriented. 

The nun stops at a closed door and tells the man, 'Please knock on this door.

He  does as he is told and this door is answered by another nun in a long habit and holding a tin cup.

This nun instructs, 'Please place $50 in the cup, then go through the large wooden door at the end of this hallway.’

He  gets $50 out of his wallet and places it in the second nun's cup. 

He then trots eagerly down the hall and slips through the door, pulling it shut behind him.

As the door locks behind him, he finds himself back in the parking lot facing another small sign.

The sign says ‘Go in Peace. You Have Just Been Screwed by the Sisters of Mercy.’",yyhua1,3328,120,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/yyhua1/sisters/,jokes

A pastor was giving the children's message during church. 

 For this part of the service, he would gather all the children around him and give a brief lesson before dismissing them for children's church.  

On this particular Sunday, he was using squirrels for an object lesson on industry and preparation.
 
He started out by saying, 

 “I'm going to describe something, and I want you to raise your hand when you know what it is.”  

The children nodded eagerly.  

“ This thing lives in trees (pause) and eats nuts (pause)”  

 No hands went up.  

“And it is gray (pause) and has a long bushy tail (pause)”  

The children were looking at each other, but still no hands raised. 

“And it jumps from branch to branch (pause) and chatters and flips its tail when it's excited (pause)”. 

Finally one little boy tentatively raised his hand.  

 The pastor breathed a sigh of relief and called on him.

540,Supermarket franchise moves into small town," A big, nationwide operating grocery franchise opened a store in a small, rural town in the midwest. Since there was only a local farmers store across the street, the manager decided to bankrupt the local store and monopolize on the town.  So he approached potential customers at the door of the local store to talk them into buying in his place, because he was much cheaper. 
The local grocer, noticing a decline in customers decided to visit one of his regulars and asked whats going on. Embarrassed and shy, she explained: „Look, its not you. Your products are great, but times are rough and this new store offers everything you do and more! And it sells everything so much cheaper!! I know buying local is important and stuff and I definetly would if it wasnt for the economy and the braces my youngest needs. We just cant afford buying your 6$/gallon milk when we can have the same for 4.99$/gallon.
Upset, but understanding, the grocer left and put up a big sign above his entrance advertising milk 4.50$/gallon.
The franchise manager, seeing what the grocer is up to decides to lower the prices and puts up a sign himself, saying „milk 4.10$/gallon.
The next day, the sign of the local grocer said „milk 4$/gallon“.
Surprised, yet determined to bankrupt the local, the franchiser lowers the price to 3.50$/gallon, only to find the local advertising it for 3$ the next day. Confident that the small grocer could never play this game longer than he could, he decided to lower the price to 2.50$/gallon, only to find the sign above his competitions entrance saying „2$/gallon milk“ the next day. The franchiser, knowing he can compensate losses for longer than the local, decided to go all in lowering the price to 0.99$/gallon, certain that within a couple weeks he could raise the price again.
But instead, the local grocer put up a sign saying:“ milk 0.5$/gallon.“

The franchiser was now losing a lot of money wirhout much to show for it and when his competition did not go bankrupt after a month, he decided to imvestigate. He went to every dairy farmer in the region, asking if his opponent had struck a deal and asking if he himself could work out an even better deal. However none of the farmed had any sort of agreement and offered the franchiser the same conditions as everyone else. Detirmined to find out how his competition could be so cheap, he hired an expensive PI firm to follow the local grocer everywhere and find out where he gets his milk so cheap. 
A month of expensive observation passed without any results. Loosing lots of money every day, the franchiser couldnt pay the private investigators anymore and had to cut costs for staff, heating, and eventually did all the work on his own in a cold, unclean store. Three months had passed since the beginning of this feud and even tho the local franchiser cut costs  everywhere he could, he went bankrupt because nobody wanted to shop in such a rundown store.

While clearing out the -now former- store and removing the sign above the entrance, he noticed his opponent watching him with a giant smirk on his face from the other side of the street. Frustrated and resigned, the franchiser approached him and asked: ""I can't understand how you can survive being so goddamned cheap, ffs I went to every dairy farmer in the state, hired the best and most expensive private investigators and none could explain how a local grocer could sell milk this cheap, I pay 3$ myself per gallon!!“


The grocer replied ""Oh, well, its actually quite simple. See, I stopped selling milk 3 months ago, but I’m glad I can start selling it again now.“",yyiakm,11,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/yyiakm/supermarket_franchise_moves_into_small_town/,jokes

The jet pilot watches the Airbus, but nothing happens. It continues to fly straight, at the same speed. After 15 minutes, the Airbus pilot radios, ""Well, how was that?

Worker A: “Why the hell we need to do all the hard job here for only a meager pay, while that arrogant foreman just sits there sipping the tea so comfy, and pockets much more than us?”

Worker B, sweating uncontrollably, said: “You’re damn right.  I need to find out why now!”

So Worker B comes to the Foreman asking the same question.

The Foreman said: “Because, you know, because you two are stupid and I’m cleverer than you.”

Worker B said he did not understand; and the Foremen offered to demonstrate.  The Foreman placed his hand on the wall nearby and asked Worker B to hit his hand as hard as he can.

Worker B obliged, and used his ham fist trying to aim at and hit the hand of the Foreman, who retracted his hand at the last moment.

After hitting his bare fist on the hard wall, Worker B, amid his great pain, heard the Foreman said: “Now you know why I am cleverer than you.”

Worker B went back to Worker A, who demanded to know what had happened.  Worker B told him about the Foreman’s “stupid/clever men” dichotomy.  But Worker A just did not get it.

Worker B proclaimed: “I was stupid but now I’m stupid no more.  Let me show you why I’m now cleverer than you!  You just hit my hand as hard as you can.”

Then Worker B put his hand on his own face.

590,The Priest and the Politician,"A parish priest was being honored at a dinner on the twenty-fifth  anniversary of his arrival in that parish. A leading local politician,  who was a member of the congregation, was chosen to make the  presentation and give a little speech at the dinner, but he was delayed  in traffic, so the priest decided to say his own few words while they  waited.  ""You will understand,"" he said, ""the seal of the confessional, can never  be broken.  However, I got my first impressions of the parish from the  first confession I heard here. I can only hint vaguely about this, but  when I came here twenty-five years ago I thought I had been assigned to a  terrible place. The very first chap who entered my confessional told me  how he had stolen a television set, and when stopped by the police, had  almost murdered the officer. Further, he told me he had embezzled money  from his place of business and had an affair with his boss's wife. I  was appalled.   But as the days went on I knew that my people were not  all like that, and I had, indeed come to, a fine parish full of  understanding and loving people.""  Just as the priest finished his talk, the politician arrived full of  apologies at being late. He immediately began to make the presentation  and give his talk.  ""I'll never forget the first day our parish priest arrived in this  parish,"" said the politician. ""In fact, I had the honor of being the  first one to go to him in confession.""",yy05re,27,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/yy05re/the_priest_and_the_politician/,jokes

593,"The farmer, the pig and the monkey","A farmer wanted to enter his pig in the biggest pig competition at the county fair and he figured if he shoved a cork up the pigs ass the pig couldn’t shit and it would just grow and grow.  
He decided to test this out on 3 different pigs, corking them for 3 months, 6 months and 1 year respectively.
The plan worked and after 3 months the pig had grown significantly, ballooning to a monstrosity. But the pig was showing signs of looking uncomfortable.
When the farmer finally pulled the cork out someone asked him whud you see?
“All I saw was piles and piles of shit”
Next time they went 6 months with a different pig and it grew into an enormous beast.
When the farmer pulled the cork out the pig just let loose a small explosion and again the farmer said all I” saw was piles and piles of shit!”

Lastly, they corked a pig and left it in for a whole year.  The pig just ate and ate and held everything in and grew as large as a pickup truck.  It was easily the largest pig anyone had seen and he obviously won first prize at the county fair.
But this pig looked like it was suffering.  The farmer  though didn’t want to have to pull the cork out so he trained a monkey to do it.  For another month the monkey practiced pulling a cork out of a bottle until the big day arrived.
The farmer stood about 100 yards away while his assistant stayed about 10 yards away to make sure it went well, and when the monkey finally pulled the cork out the pig squealed in relief and it was like a putrid volcano of shit all across the farm.  
Whud you see back there he asked farmer? Again he said “all I saw was piles and piles of shit!”
Whud you see, way up there, did it go well?
His assistant said “all I saw was the poor monkey trying to stick the cork back in!”",yya4fk,5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/yya4fk/the_farmer_the_pig_and_the_monkey/,jokes

&#x200B;

The people did some research and found that they could travel and buy a cow from Moscow for 2,000 rubles, or one from Minsk for 1,000 rubles. Being frugal,

they bought the cow from Minsk. The cow was wonderful.

&#x200B;

It produced lots of milk all the time, and the people were amazed and very happy. They decided to acquire a bull to mate with the cow and produce more

cows like it. Then they would never have to worry about the milk supply again. They bought a bull and put it in the pasture with their beloved cow. However,

whenever the bull came close to the cow, the cow would move away. No matter what approach the bull tried, the cow would move away from the bull and he

could not succeed in his quest.

&#x200B;

The people were very upset and decided to ask their wise rabbi, what to do.

&#x200B;

They told the rabbi what was happening. “Whenever the bull approaches our cow, she moves away. If he approaches from the back, she moves forward. When

he approaches her from the front, she backs off. An approach from the side and she just walks away to the other side.”

&#x200B;

The rabbi thought about this for a minute and asked, “Did you buy this cow in Minsk?”

&#x200B;

The people were dumbfounded, since they had never mentioned where they had gotten the cow.

&#x200B;

“You are truly a wise rabbi,” they said. “How did you know we got the cow in Minsk?”

“Gramps, I’m so excited to go on my first cruise,” he says.

“Well, son, let me see your pack so I can make sure you’re taking everything you need,” says the grandfather.

The sailor goes and grabs his suitcase.

He opens it for his grandfather to inspect, only to get smacked on the back of the head.

“Boy, you’re going around the world. Where’re your pills for motion sickness? What if you get seasick. You don’t want to embarrass yourself. Also, where’s your condoms? You’ll stop in many ports and meet many women. You don’t know what they have or don’t. Be safe.”

The sailor ran to the local pharmacy and bought a bottle of Dramamine and a pack of condoms.

He returned to his grandfather and showed them to him.

“Are you going for one day?! That’s not enough.” said the grandfather,

so the sailor went back to the pharmacy and bought 10 more packs of Dramamine and 10 more packs of condoms.

“Are you kidding?” asked the grandfather when he came back.

“You’re going around the world. That’s at least 6 months.”

The sailor ran off to the pharmacy again, and as he walked in, yelled to the pharmacist,

“100 more packs of Dramamine, and 100 more packs of condoms!”

They pause for a moment in silence, but hear nothing. 

Just as the second hunter turns around, the first finds a cinderblock. They nod, thinking surely this will be heavy enough to make a noise as it hits the bottom.

They both heave the cinderblock down the clean-cut, ten-foot, seemingly bottomless pit. They lean over, just as before, cupping their hands around their ears.

Suddenly, a loud racket comes up from behind them. They both dodge out of the way as a brown goat sprints past them, nearly knocking them in, and dives headfirst down the hole, into the darkness below.

Shocked at this occurrence, both hunters agree to speak to the owner of the land they’d been on. They find the farmer’s house and knock on her door.

When she answers, both of them attempt to explain what had happened.

“We found this ten-foot hole about a quarter mile that way,” one said.

“It’s clean-cut and we couldn’t tell how deep it was. We dropped a stick and didn’t hear anything, we tried a rock too and didn’t hear anything either.”

“Then this goat came barreling past us, nearly knocked us in, and dove straight down.”

The farmer looked puzzled. “Was it a brown goat?” she asked.

The two hunters nodded, and the farmer shook her head.

“That’s impossible, I had him tied to a cinderblock.”",yxea7j,33,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/yxea7j/two_hunters_and_a_goat/,jokes
