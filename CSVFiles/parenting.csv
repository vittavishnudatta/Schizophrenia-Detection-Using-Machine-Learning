2,Turns out everyone else but me knows what lemon zest is,"Turns out there’s an age when it’s embarrassing to not know what lemon zest is and apparently that age is 39 years old. 

My recipe called for lemon zest, and I didn’t want to ask what that was because a 39 year old should know apparently (except I didn’t) and my phone was dead so I couldn’t Google it.  My 8-year-old is just now learning her mom actually is severely lacking in most areas except for Victorian lit which has come in handy exactly zero times. 

Anywayz, turns out it doesn’t come in a pre-made baggy, and it’s the outside yellow layer of a lemon and not the white part bc that’s super bitter, and if you didn’t know that but were too embarrassed to ask, you’re welcome. 

Also I sent my daughter to ask a random lady because it’s perfectly acceptable for an 8-year-old not to know, and now I’m a mom teaching my kids independence vs a ridiculous mom who’s never heard of lemon zest.",z36fxr,336,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z36fxr/turns_out_everyone_else_but_me_knows_what_lemon/,parenting
3,I hate being a stay at home mom,"I have 2 kids (3yo & 2yo) and I've come to hate being a SAHM. I resent my husband for working out of town for weeks at a time, barely helping when he's home and offering little to no support. I don't even enjoy the time I spend with my kids. I am with the kids 24/7 and it's breaking me. I am scared about getting back into the 'real world' but I know that I can't continue on like this. I feel like a failure, I'm supposed to enjoy being a mom and staying at home with the kids but I don't.",z30xwi,527,416,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z30xwi/i_hate_being_a_stay_at_home_mom/,parenting
4,"How do I tell my friend who recently lost her newborn, that I'm expecting?","A close friend lost her baby earlier this year, a day after the baby was born. I'm close to both her and her husband, and they're still struggling immensely, rightfully so. I'm expecting my 3rd and it's not that I want to tell them to have them congratulate me or anything like that, but sooner or later they're going to find out, and I'd prefer they here it from me. 

How do I tell them while navigating this as sensitively and respectfully as possible? Do I tell them that I have news to share and it may bring up traumatic feelings for them, and do I make it clear that I don't expect them to feel or share any feelings of excitement or happiness, and that I'm telling them so that they can have time to process their own emotions? I'm feeling pretty clueless on how to share this with them. Any advice?",z3a0jc,42,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z3a0jc/how_do_i_tell_my_friend_who_recently_lost_her/,parenting
5,My stepson isn’t bright,"I am at a bit of a loss.  My wife’s son is not bright.  He was diagnosed with a minor learning disorder.  I am sure if anyone cared I would have been too.   His dad rides him hard but his mom (my wife) is so far the opposite.  I feel bad for this kid.  He doesn’t have a chance.   17. Homeschooled.  From what i understand you can do a whole week in 7 hours.   He works at a sandwich shop.

The issue is he does not do his schoolwork at all.  She sits for hours a week and does 80% of his school work.   While he sits next to her and either scrolls on his phone or plays Xbox.  She asks him to do it all week but continues to let him “make his own choices “.  He goes out and smokes weed with his buddies which I’m not even mad at if you handle your responsibilities.  He is a good worker I’ll give him that but she does everything for him.  He has next to zero chores while my kids do all the normal responsibilities teens have.   He does not make himself food.   She does and 90% of the time her kids just eat fast food.  That cost adds up.  She will leave time we are spending together after he hasn’t done a single thing she has asked and sit for hours catching him up with in school.

He asks to go out or for this and that and she will say no but not sure why because she will always give in and say yes.  He sits in his room and plays Xbox every other waking moment of his life.

I have tried to step in but she won’t let me.   She gets mama bear and says I don’t understand the mental abuse he does though from her ex.   I lived with her ex 20
Years ago and he is a dick for sure but I keep explaining that she is hurting him and setting him up for unrealistic expectations.   She does  his laundry and cleans his room.  He contributes almost nothing.    She can’t contribute much to our life in terms of money because she needs it for fast food for her kids or whatever else they ask for 

She has not contributed 1 dime to our retirement and if is anything.  I’m the asshole.   

I love her but this is so frustrating to feel powerless in my own home.    I know she doesn’t s overcompensating because she lost the kids for years to her ex because she made some large mistakes during a time of pill addiction.  But she turned that around a long time ago and is very active in her church.  She is a great human but she is hurting her son who seriously.  He told me he gets confused between a line and a lemon…..I’m not kidding.   I’m not sure what to do except leave her and that’s a bit extreme for this i think but I’m becoming resentful.   I’m writing a Reddit over it.",z2r4f5,426,237,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z2r4f5/my_stepson_isnt_bright/,parenting
6,Today I have a 2 year old..,Today I have a 2 year old.. it’s bittersweet. Last night I selfishly kept him up a little past his bed time because that was the last night he was going to be my little 1 year old. I held him. He was just hugging me and I couldn’t help but cry thinking about how he’s growing up and we are here at this point now. Two will bring more independence for him. Less needing me for task and more wanting to do them for himself.. Less baby talk and more words.. I am a sad but happy mother today. Sad for the time passing by so quickly and him not being my little newborn anymore but happy for the energetic and curious big boy he’s becoming. Two years ago I held him on his first day in this world and now he ask “what’s this?” To everything he holds.,z2p6ds,450,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z2p6ds/today_i_have_a_2_year_old/,parenting
7,My child’s daycare didn’t celebrate with cupcakes.,"I’ve been telling my daughter’s daycare for a week now that I would send in cupcakes for my daughter’s birthday. I even asked about allergies. I wouldn’t have spent all afternoon yesterday making “funfetti” cupcakes from scratch - with decorative frosting and everything - if I had known they would just get sent back home to us. I wouldn’t have bothered. It’s just us for thanksgiving and her birthday this year, just like it is every year. My little family of 4. I didn’t throw a party for her because it’s a holiday weekend and while I have made it a point to attend every party we’ve been invited to (usually the only child aside from relatives), I didn’t want to disappoint my own child (or maybe myself) and not have anyone show up. So I sent her to daycare with birthday cupcakes. And they were sent right back.

Edit: Was told they were just too busy today to celebrate her birthday.",z31n4p,80,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z31n4p/my_childs_daycare_didnt_celebrate_with_cupcakes/,parenting
8,How to deal with 8 year old's hyperfixation on organizing events,"I have an 8 year old daughter. She frequently becomes very fixated on organizing events to do with her peers. The last time it was ""the show."" It was basically a play she wanted to put on based on a TV show that she was watching. She talked about it for months, was always telling people at school to practice for it, always trying to get her sister to help work on it, trying to get me to organize with parents. The problem is none of the other kids care about this nearly as much as her and after about 6 months of talking about ""the show"" it just sort of never materialized and she moved on. Now we're on to something similar, ""the video."" She's trying to recruit kids from across the school to reenact a music video. She's holding some sort of auditions, asking people to work on ""sets,"" etc. But in reality I'm pretty sure these kids are like ""yeah, sounds cool, sure,"" but aren't actually devoting much if any time to this outside of when she is talking to them about it. However, these things will completely absorb my daughter's downtime. She'll talk about it and plan for it incessantly. 

I'm not really sure what to do about it. She's been asking me to reach out to all of these parents and I have been telling her no. I told her that they need to organize everything at school and if they finally decide that they are ready and want to do this, then let me know. I don't want to be unsupportive, but I also don't want her let down by the fact that no one is as interested in this as her. I'm pretty sure this is the case because no other parents have ever reached out to me at the urging of their kids, whereas I did this a few times the first time around for ""the show.""

Any suggestions? Im not trying to be a wet blanket, but I'm also trying to help her manage her expectations. She has a very hard time making friends, so I assume something like this is an attempt to connect with people. However, I suspect it may do the opposite when she's always taking these things very seriously and pressuring her peers.",z2wlpw,138,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z2wlpw/how_to_deal_with_8_year_olds_hyperfixation_on/,parenting
9,"Birthday party etiquette, pay for parents to ice skate or no?",Our 8 year old wants an ice skating birthday party at the rink- the starting rate includes the party room and skating for 12 and $13 for each additional person and we’ll likely have about 20 kids. Question- are they old enough to skate alone or is it fine to not offer to pay for the parents to skate as well? That would be cost prohibitive for us but I also don’t want to be rude.,z31ch7,73,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z31ch7/birthday_party_etiquette_pay_for_parents_to_ice/,parenting
10,Daycare Worker lost it on my kid and got fired..,"We are new to daycare this year. My daughter is 4. We had her in preschool last year at this place and she liked it so we figured we'd try 3 day a week at their daycare. There have been learning curves for her and us but overall we still like this place. 

Today when we went to pick up my daughter the assistant director pulled me aside. She said that this past Friday my daughter was refusing to come inside/ off the playground and a staff member they've had there for 5 years lost their patience and grabbed my daughter by the ankles and dragged her. I'm not sure how far she was dragged, (we didn't notice any marks on her). But she told me the staff member has been fired as that reaction was not policy and there were other helpers on the playground that could have taken over so she wouldn't lose her temper. At the time I didn't ask too many questions as I know my daughter can be pretty defiant. Leaving the playground has always been hard for her. I know her main teacher has had some attitude problems with her as well. So I asked if the staff frequently deals with kids with attitudes like hers. I mean, I don't think she's that bad, but she never had an attitude note from her preschool teacher but with daycare we are always getting notes about her attitude, so maybe there's something I'm not seeing about her.  The director told me she just has defiance issues and normally their plan to deal with kids like that is to give them options, make them feel more in control. This staff member did not act appropriately which is why she lost her job. It was hard to let her go as she was a much loved staff member but it was a rule they can't bend.  We ended the conversation shortly after that.

 I'm not sure if I'm under reacting but my main issue is I did find it odd they waited till Wednesday to talk to us about this. We even spoke briefly to the director that Monday and she didn't mention it.  And I mean, even though our kid only goes Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays they could have called us. It doesn't have to be an in person convo. So I don't know if they had to investigate what happened, maybe whoever reported it didn't talk to the boss till Monday or what. 

My daughter wasn't phased by the attack. I guess she doesn't even remember it because when we try to talk to her about it she says nothing bad happened. But if she was a bit more verbal, it would have been shitty to find out from her first so I'm really surprised they delayed telling us.  My husband is a bit more emotional about this than I am and plans to talk to the director on Monday since he normally sees her during drop off.

I'm not sure if we'll pull her out. She loves it there and I feel like that kind of thing could happen anywhere. 

What are your thoughts? What would you ask on Monday?",z38tr7,26,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z38tr7/daycare_worker_lost_it_on_my_kid_and_got_fired/,parenting
11,How can I make it up to my kid,"Hello fellow parents, yesterday I messed up. My kid's school had an open house which meant all the parents were invited to see how the school works, have snacks and spend some time with the teachers for two hours. I am an immigrant in a foreign country and when the weekly letter came I read it and I understood that parents that want their kids to attend this school were welcome but I missed the point where it was mentioned that also parents that their kids already attend their school are welcome as well. 

Every single parent showed up and I didn't. My kid was devastated and I felt SO SHITTY. I have always attended every single thing all those years but my 9yo felt so bad. She is the second child too and I don't want her to feel like she isn't in the same place in my heart as her siblings. 

The teacher today asked her why I didn't attend and she explained to her the reason but having to answer the question she felt even more shitty. Guys I feel so bad I want to cry. Just imagining her being there with all the kids and being the only kid without a parent there to support her and be proud of her brings tears in my eyes. 

Please give me some advice on what to do. She is a very shy and not showing many emotions but I know this hurt her so much. I want to do something but don't know what. Any advice?",z2zo4m,79,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z2zo4m/how_can_i_make_it_up_to_my_kid/,parenting

13,My son and I have had the flu and I honestly want to cry 🙃,"My son (2yo) stayed with my cousin and her husband for a few days while I was in the hospital with a friend. 
The last day he was there, her husband started feeling sick and the next day discovered that he had the flu. My son had since gone home but was showing symptoms. I picked them up a couple of days later so now that he's feeling better and back to running around, screaming, playing, I feel like I got hit by a truck, it hurts to talk, exhausting just to get out of bed, head feels like it might explode, I am FREEZING all of the time, etc

14,Another “4 year old tantrum” post… did I do the right thing?,"So my son is juuuust about four, and today, I can understand why they’re called the f***ing fours, or at least, I’m starting to. 

Today was a normal day for us, but I’ve noticed he’s been a bit off lately. I’ve attributed it to him going through a developmental change/growth spurt, etc. nothings really changed too much and our life is the same it’s always kind of been. 

We ended up going to an indoor playground for a while to pass some time, and towards the end, I gave him about three warnings that it was almost time to go. THEN… he asks for ice cream.  deep breath. I say “ no buddy, you had some ice cream yesterday and we don’t have treats like everyday. Sorry”. He starts bawling. 🤦🏻‍♀️ I’m thinking okay, I know how to usually turn him around from this type of situation. I validate his feelings- “I know you really want it, it sucks when we can’t have what we want” but he just starts freaking. Like full blown freaking out- which is not normal for him. He starts screaming. And I react and say, okay.. it’s time to go. And then he really loses his shit. Like full-on tantrum, screaming freak out at this indoor playground. Now I’m embarrassed and I’m trying to get outta there with him and my younger kid. Eventually I pick up the four year old and I carry him to the car. He’s still freaking, kicking, hitting and even bit me. I get him to the car and I strap him in his seat and I close the door and let him scream. And I just stand there in the cold air, my mind racing, feeling like I want to freak out and cry. I’m thinking, okay… this is the “f***ing fours” everyone is talking about. Maybe I could have done something different to stop this, or maybe not. But I’m scared for the year ahead.

15,Realizing meat is animals,"My 5 year old has put together all the pieces of where meat comes from, now she's refusing to eat it. Is this a phase or an age thing? 

She is not a good eater anyway (we are in OT for feeding issues) & has only ever liked chicken, no it's on the no list.     
She seems genuinely disturbed by finding this out & keeps telling us reasons why we shouldn't eat birds. She's also restarted telling us reasons why we shouldn't eat cows (but not pigs, she is convinced we don't actually eat pigs). It's not just that she doesn't want to eat meat, she also gets upset when we do it. I've told her she can choose what she eats but I like meat & want to eat it, she responds by continuing to tell us why we shouldn't.

Reasons she's given:.     
Birds have babies they protect.     
Even if the one I'm eating didn't have babies, it would if it was allowed to.    
""We can't just kill things to eat them!"".     
It's wrong to kill things, anything, I wouldn't want to be killed to be eaten.     
We aren't supposed to hurt animals, animals are for petting not hurting.    


Help 😭


↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓


ETA: Thank you to everyone who replied, I can't reply to everyone so here is some thing I saw come up the most:

**•** I do not have any intentions to make her eat meat. If she chooses to I will encourage her to & if she chooses not to I will encourage that too. Unless a choice she's making is unsafe or unhealthy I let her decide within reason.    
To the people suggesting I hide meat in her food to trick her into eating it - that's going to be a hard no. 

**•** My initial question was is this a phase or an age thing, it appears to be pretty equally split on if it is or not. So, I guess we'll see. Thank you to everyone who answered ❤️

**•** There were a lot of suggestions that I talk to her about the food chain which I intend to do today.     
I will tell her that some animals need eat other animals for survival & that others eat plants to survive, but that we as humans can eat both & it's our choice if we want to eat other animals or not. I feel like this is the most fair approach.    
I will not be letting her watch videos of animals eating other animals, not will we be watching farm animals being killed, I'm not sure why anyone felt the need to suggest these but no.

**•** To the people who suggested I make it clear that she cannot choose what her dad & I eat, I have. However she's 5 & in her mind she sees eating animals as mean, cruel, and wrong. I will continue to let her know she can't make decisions for us, but I don't view her telling us not to as her being ""the boss"" this is new to her, she is still navigating the situation.

**•** To anyone who tried to shame me - save it. I don't need to hear about how I'm ""letting the liberals raise her"" or how she's too sensitive, or that I'm not being a stern enough parent.",z298cd,1246,1171,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z298cd/realizing_meat_is_animals/,parenting

17,Daycare teacher told him it would fall off,"My 3.5 year old has had a couple pee incidents over the last week (he was doing really well with using the potty). Today, he came home and told us that a teacher from another class told him if he kept having accidents his weewee would fall off. I didn't really react though I didn't think that was useful or appropriate, but thought we'd just let it slide, esp since he's home with us for the next four days anyway. However, after dinner he had a little leak before making it to the potty and basically lost his mind when I told him we had to change him out of his underwear. I totally had forgotten about the earlier comment, but finally got him to tell me (wail at me, really) that he didn't want his wee-wee to fall off, as his gripping it and crying hysterically. So obviously this is not great. I got him calmed down by promising him this isn't true, that mommy knows more than anyone else (lol), and also that daddy had accidents and he still has one. Maybe he'll be over it tomorrow, but I doubt it. He didn't want me to tell my husband and hid from him when he needed to pee again. So. Not sure what I need here, ideas for helping him move past this, suggestions for how to speak with daycare calmly about it, I was very close to shooting off a very angry message but they wouldn't see it anyway so I have to time to think and see how the weekend goes.",z3apon,5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z3apon/daycare_teacher_told_him_it_would_fall_off/,parenting
18,How to handle punishment for 17 year old I'm looking after?,"I (27f) am currently house sitting and looking after relative's two kids (14&17f).

Both are very spoiled to say the least, do not help with chores unless asked multiple times, and just overall very dependent on their mother.

I made clear that I am not their mum, so will not be driving them back and forth to school (there's public transport which they are perfectly capable of using and do so on the days they're not running late).

On top of all of this I found out on day 1 that their cat had fleas so was also tackling this whilst looking after my own toddler who's staying here with me.

Fast forward to today, usually I make sure the younger one is awake in time and walk her to the bus. As she is off for the rest of the week I used the morning to have a lie in. I woke up an hour later and 17f is still in bed and at this point 2 hours late for school. On top of that the dishes I asked her to do two days ago repeatedly not washed either. I will talk to their parents as soon as I can reach them.

The level of zero f*cks these children give repulses me and needless to say I will not be doing this again in future.

23,About Santa role in Christmas,"Hello Reddit!

Last years I share on Facebook something we do in my house in the Christmas about the Santa and some people find interesting and I wanna share with you guys, maybe can be interesting for anyone.

We have a 10yo and a 3yo boys and we always feed the imagination about Santa in our home, but we came of a poor country (Brasil) and I used to buy a lot of presents to give to many children who live on the streets (with food, I used to wrap the presents and give to the mom or dad, or the guardian on the street, to decide how or when give to the child). But my son starts to ask why Santa don’t give presents to these kids? Why he is so mean to them? (In that time he was 4yo)

Yes… Difficult to save the magic.

I explain to him “Santa Claus is the mailman of the Christmas. There is so much kids in the world, the post office can’t attend everyone, so the parents buy presents online and Santa make sure of all those kids will get one in time. It’s a lot of job, but he can do it. But some parents cannot afford presents and it’s not their fault.” This make a lot of easier to explain how he cannot get a dinosaur or airplane on the Christmas too, because, mom and dad can’t buy these things, as well. 

Now we live in Japan, where don’t have kids on the streets, but we keep telling the same story for the younger.

25,Slumber Party problems,"Hello all, 

I need your advice. My daughter is 8 going on 9 here soon. She wants to invite her best friend  over for a slumber party for her birthday. But I can’t stand the best friend. Like at all. She reminds of a Veruca Salt from Willy Wonka. Very spoiled and selfish child. She terrorized the poor puppy the last time she was at my place. And she continued to throw my daughters toys the stairs because she thought it was funny. I’ve met her mother who is a really nice person. But she gets walked on by both her kids, a 9 year old girl  and 14 year old boy. The boy constantly swears at her, and has shoving fights with his sister. No respect on this family what so ever. This family is constantly asking for my daughter to spend the night. So far I have been kindly saying that we don’t do sleepovers yet. But they are getting older and want to hangout. 

My question is, do I allow her to invite her friend? Even though I know she will be a terror and destroy things in my house, even though I ask her not to do it? Do I just keep saying no with sleep overs, even though she really wants one? Or, do I have a conservation with the mom about the girls behavior? 

My fear is that If I push my daughter into not having this friendship with this little girl, she will want her to be her friend even more. I have conversations with her (my daughter) regarding the bad choices she (her friend) made at last visit, and that’s not how we handle animals or toys. My daughter understood that things she was doing was bad. But didn’t stop it. She is a very shy and timid girl. And was very apologetic to me afterwards when had this discussion.
If you made it this far, thanks. Any advice is welcome.",z374ri,4,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z374ri/slumber_party_problems/,parenting
26,What is heathy emotional expression vs disrespect and the correct way to teach children?,"I grew up in a home where I was spanked for having negative big emotions. I was told I would be given something to cry for if I didn’t quit. Or stop being dramatic get over it. I have tried my best to allow my children to tell me how they are feeling even if I am the cause of those feelings. My daughter is approaching an age where she’s beginning to feel a lot of big emotions and now has the vocabulary and ability to name and explain them. I’m realizing I don’t know how to differentiate what is OK and what is actually disrespectful and crossing the line into being unhealthy. Any of you out there with healthy emotional development and  relationships, if you could give me advice on how I should handle when she feels upset, angry, or  frustrated and expresses that I’m being rude and what is actually disrespectful versus Healthy expression? Anytime my children express themselves my gut tells me that that are being rude and dramatic so I have to carefully think on what’s being said before determining it was not okay. I’m aware that this is result of my childhood so now when I’ve concluded a behavior was not okay I’m constantly wondering if what she is saying is fine and maybe it’s something I don’t realize yet I N was just told it was disrespectful?

28,8yo doesn't trust me because I broke a promise,"Background: I have 2 kids, 10 and 8. My husband, the father of my kids, has been locked up for 4 years, half their lives. When he was first arrested, we visited twice a week, then they would only come once a week, and now they come maybe twice a year. They get bored because we can't bring electronics, books, or anything. We can literally only bring ID, keys, and birth certificates for minors. The visits are behind a glass and we use a phone to communicate. 

My 8yo daughter (D) has told me that she doesn't want me talking about her. I don't know if it's specifically with him or talking about her with people in general. I understand if there are things she wants to tell him herself or things she might be embarrassed about, but I still talk about everyday things. She doesn't talk to him on the phone when he calls on weekends though because she's usually busy playing Roblox with friends from school. Dad is aware that she doesn't want me talking about her. 

Today during the visit, her dad asked about my day. I told him I was role-playing with D and I had to pick her up when she was on all fours and she was using dead weight and I was tired and needing a nap but she wanted to keep playing. He mentioned the role-playing to D and she got mad that I talked about her. I pinky-promised that I wouldn't talk about her anymore but she has to talk to him when he calls because he wants to know what's going on in her life and he misses her. 

After the visit, he called and he was on the Bluetooth in my car. He was talking to my older daughter, which was fine and normal, but then he directed the conversation to D. I told her dad that she fell asleep and he said that she looked tired during the visit.

When we got home, D called me out for talking about her sleeping in the car and that her dad talked about her too when he said he eyes looked heavy. She was so upset and she told me she can't trust me anymore because I broke a pinky promise. We all legit ugly cried (even 10yo because she has autism and big feelings and wants everyone to be happy and not angry with each other).

I don't know what to do. I feel like her behavior isn't normal but I also feel like she's just trying to have control over something because she's trying to compensate for something else, but I could be wrong. She's a very spoiled kid and has a lot of freedom that's usually reserved for older kids.

Any advice on how to gain her trust back?

35,Advice ?,"Hey so I’m needing some advice, you know how younger kids say things just to say them? Like they’ll just lie in normal conversation. Like a young boy playfully saying with confidence “I could totally walk a tight rope! I have the best balance in the world” or a kid saying they can hold their breath underwater for 5 hours. When they’re young, they’re just understanding fantasy from fact. And it’s just what kids do 

Well my daughter is 10 and she still does this. We were hanging out with some of her friends and she said she can hold her bladder “for 15 hours”. Obviously this isn’t true and her friend said so, which led to my daughter getting very defensive. I don’t really know what to do about it. She says things all the time that are just objectively false, but she says them as truth. She also pretends to know things or facts about things, that aren’t true. Like for example something as simple as some fact about space. …. That isn’t true. 

I’ve tried talking to her about it but idk how to correct it. What do I do? I think she’s just doing it to come across as interesting to people. But idk. Also she’s not attention deprived, I’m a single mom and we have a good relationship. And she has a very close relationship with my parents. And some close friends.

36,Newborn - pushy weight gain targets?,"Grateful for advice or input from experienced parents.

Our beautiful baby boy was born at a whopping 9lbs 7oz, or 4.28kg last Wednesday via C-Section (unplanned, baby in breech).  He lost weight in range (as normal) to 3.89kgs, and has been gaining since - I am not producing quite enough breast milk for his hunger, and we supplemented with formula, although he takes less and less each day and more breastmilk as my supplies come in.

My midwife is stating he needs to be back at birth weight by Day 10 - this seems to be a punishing target.  Yesterday (Day 7) he was 4.1KG, with another 180g to go.  He is stable and gaining bit by bit, so I am not concerned and I think the midwife is being too draconian on such a target, especially when he will have expelled a lot of amniotic fluid by weeing because of the Caesarian.  

Are such pushy weight gain targets normal/reasonable?

He is an easy baby and loves to sleep - when he is hungry I feed him and he gobbles down two boobs, expressed milk (which I pump when he sleeps), and sometimes his ""dessert"" (formula) on top.  This can be as much as 100ml in one serving, which is huge for a newborn (but he is a big full term boy!).",z3ecqb,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z3ecqb/newborn_pushy_weight_gain_targets/,parenting

39,Formula vs breastfeeding 2 week old advice,I am a FTM with a 2 week old and originally thought I would breastfeed exclusively for the whole recommended year. At first I was not pumping and just breastfeeding but he was cluster feeding and wanted to eat/suckle for comfort all night long and I was not sleeping. So then I began pumping so that my husband could help feed him at night. We then started giving him a bottle full time because he didn’t seem to ever get full from breastfeeding and wouldn’t stay awake to eat and wouldn’t wake up either. Now that I am only pumping to produce I am having a hard time keeping up supply and we have resorted to temporarily giving him formula while I try to stock up. I still cannot seem to stay caught up because he recently went from eating maybe 2 oz to 4 oz each time. I have a hard time getting one of my breast to produce anything in the first place so this does not help. I am only producing half of what I could be. I have really been considering going to formula full time but am racked with guilt because it would be taking the easy way out and I’ve read that exclusively breastfed babies have less infections and illnesses. I would hate for him to get sick more often because I didn’t want to pump all day every day to barely get enough. Does this sound silly? Another con is the price of formula. So my question is if anyone else has been in a similar situation and what did you do? It would be so much easier to formula feed but I do not want to deprive him of anything.,z33cc9,3,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z33cc9/formula_vs_breastfeeding_2_week_old_advice/,parenting

They’ve hit a slump and nothing is currently entertaining him he can’t focus enough to watch something and he wants to be actively moving. He gets very upset if he has no attention and my older kids (17,15) can only be with him for so long before their patience runs out.

42,SAHM and housework,"We have one child 9 months old. My wife wants to quit her job and stay at home with, at least for a few years. I’m fine with this; I make enough money. 

However, when she worked, we split chores evenly. If she stays home, I feel she should take on most of the housework. She disagrees.

Am I being unreasonable? How do other SAHM parents divide housework?

Edit: well this post went over like a lead balloon. Some people were very kind (thank you). Some people were very angry with me (including call me all kinds of names). However, just to clarify:

1. This is not a feminist issue. I am not trying to get my wife to stay at home, do all the housework, etc. quite the opposite. She makes 120 a year working. If she works, obviously we can hire a nanny, housekeeper, someone to pick up our laundry, deliver our groceries etc (I mean we would have 120 thousand to spend—minus taxes commute and lunches). However she wants to stay home with our kid. While it makes no financial sense or work sense, I can understand. I adore him; I don’t like to leave him. But if she stays home, we will have cancel the housekeeper, order food in less, not have someone pick up our laundry etc. She will have to work much harder and take on the majority of the etc work. That’s what I’m trying to say.

2. Of course I’ll still do things like 1. All yard work 2. Taking out trash 3. Paying all bills 4. Most cooking  (I actually love cooking) 5. And countless other things. For example, I just scrubbed all the toilets yesterday (my wife hates cleaning toilets; I don’t care) Nothing in my post said I wouldn’t work around the house. But the workload will increase—there is no way around it—she will have to increase to match the work ie is she stays home, she will have to cover the extra work; ie she will have to do the majority of the housework.
 
Edit: I don’t think that women who work outside of the home are worse mothers. Bizarrely, this view is being taken as somehow I am sexist. That is a very counterintuitive view of feminism.",z25qdf,401,732,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z25qdf/sahm_and_housework/,parenting

44,Teen is extremely entitled and is convinced I do not love him. Advice desperately needed,"I really need help here as I'm at a loss on how to deal with my 13 year old son Jack.  I'm not sure the best way to lay things out so excuse me if it comes out as word vomit/disjointed.  Yesterday I spent the whole day with my 13 year old at the hospital.  It turned out to be nothing serious but you know how hospitals are - you don't get in and out very fast.  We played board games, talked, and joked.  Basically tried to make those hours as enjoyable as possible - to top it off we stopped in at a wee restaurant on the way home.   
While it was just the two of us, I wanted to address a few things he's said in the past and I'll have to give you a ""flashback"" in order for you to understand the conversation.

In the past few months we've had several incidents - Vaping, misbehaving at school and huffing deodorant.  Jack was grounded and decided to run away.  My husband found him and brought him home at around midnight.  His reasoning for all of this was that I (being the mum) don't love him and that he'd read a google doc when he was 8 about how I loved the other children and hated him.  This is absolutely not true. I have never written anything like this and I never would have.   I've checked my google docs and there is nothing that could even be misconstrued as this.  I have somehow become the bad guy, the source of all his problems despite being the ""nicer"" softer parent and my husband who is a stricter more authoritarian parent is the good guy.  I told my son that of course I love him and that I have never written such a thing but he refused to believe me and said he'd runaway again.

An important (maybe) tidbit here is this.  I had Jack when I was 18 and his biological father has not been in his life ever.  We have reached out to bio dad several times but he's never responded.  We have a good relationship with bio dads family and I've always been honest with my son about bio dad.  Jack had a good childhood.  I had family support and stayed home for 3 years before going to work.  My husband has raised our son since Jack was 1 year old and he is treated exactly the same as our other children, my son has called him dad since he was 3 and the fact that they're not biologically bound never crosses our mind unless Jack brings up bio dad.  My husbands a very involved dad with a good bond with Jack.  His family are very loving and treat Jack just as they would any other grandchild.  

So back to the restaurant - I told Jack again that I love him just as much as the other kids and that I always have.  He responded by saying that I had thought about aborting him and that I'm always angry.  Now don't go thinking I've yelled at him ""I should have aborted you!""  As he's gotten older he's asked more questions and we've had open discussions where he's asked me if I thought about having an abortion since I got pregnant so young.  I have responded that yes I considered it but I didn't want one as I loved the wee bean in my stomach (him being the bean).  I tried to speak further about this but he held his stance and stopped talking.  

I was sad that he felt this way but now I actually feel offended/angry.  It's not the tough balance of working and parenting.  I didn't expect to be appreciated for the cooking/cleaning and running around but I've always given him everything he wanted growing up.  Birthdays and Xmas's I set the bar very high.  The most recent one he got a motorbike, another year we took him on a plane so that he could go to an amusement park and spend 3 days just him, me and his dad.  He used to refuse to wear clothes that were not branded with a label so I got him those too.  Every year, my job pays for accommodation in a top hotel in another city and every year I take him and my husband.  We go to the amusement parks/shopping and just have a general awesome time where we can let go of the purse strings and spoil ourselves for this week.  It's not just the money though.  We value out family time and I spend a lot of time with the kids.  I put aside time to have one-on-one time with all of them.  Jack and I will play xbox together or badminton or go out somewhere for lunch.  The thing is, Jack has always had a victim mindset - he used to go to school and say that we couldn't afford food.  Some of the other kids would give him their lunch which frustrated me to no end because I had packed him a healthy lunch just not with lollies and heavily processed sugar packets.  He knows that he can manipulate people if he can be the ""victim"".  He has 3 younger siblings who missed out on those trips.  I've seen him throw out brand new clothes because he's changed his mind about liking them.  I have noticed that he has become increasingly more entitled so when we were at the hospital I stated that we should ""give back"" over the xmas period eg stack the firewood for nana, do the old ladies lawns next door.  He was not interested at all, lots of excuses as to why he can't do anything to give back.  Only interested in what he was getting.  He wants a new bike helmet and top.  Well he literally threw out a perfectly good helmet and bike top because he didn't like them 6 months ago. 

TLDR;  Someone please help me work out this cluster\*\*\*\*.  I've two issues.  My son thinks I hate him and resents me, two he's very selfish, entitled and doesn't appreciate how good he actually has it.",z37377,2,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z37377/teen_is_extremely_entitled_and_is_convinced_i_do/,parenting
45,Postpartum is so lonely …,"Everyone said how exhausting the newborn phase is and though this is very much true. I am only 5 weeks in and finding the loneliness and isolation so much worse. 

My partner works 2 jobs so is unfortunately not able to help as much as we’d like. Between both jobs and getting sleep I’m the one caring for our little girl almost 24/7. It’s just how it is at the moment and that can’t be helped. He makes dinners, takes on feeds when he comes home, cleans the bottles. He does 110% when he can and I’m super grateful for it but it’s only a few hours and generally I use this time to get a shower or go to the store. 

People mention ‘It takes a village’ but my village is just 1. I don’t have any friends, but I do have family in my partners side. My side is just my mom. We had a lot of visitors at the start but seems to have been just to see the baby. But since then there’s very little contact, and if there is a message it’s asking about the baby and replies quickly stop. 

We have a party on Saturday and I’ve been looking forward to it (First night out since finding out I was pregnant in March this year) but now it looks like I won’t be able
to go because we can’t get a sitter. It’s a family get together with my partners siblings and his parents are already minding his sisters children, both her children are under 2 and by baby is only 5 weeks with bad colic, it’d be too much for them to handle all 3. 

I was hoping my mom would be able to babysit for the few hours but I’ve called her a few times over the last week to ask her but she hasn’t answered or replied to my messages. 

I’ve encouraged my partner to go and I’ll stay home with the baby since it’s his siblings and sort of a Christmas party among at them and it’d be weird me going without him. He’s saying he won’t but that’s making me feel worse for some reason. (He does so much and I feel deserves a night out) 

My baby has pretty bad colic so I understand people not wanting to sit for us and not wanting to visit because it’s tough to listen to and even try have a conversation with a screaming baby. It even prevents me going outside cause its very unpredictable when she starts and settling her is next to impossible. 

I know it doesn’t last forever and it will pass but it’s very tough while you’re in it. Everyday is the same yet somehow different. The same four walls, the same routine, the counting steps as I walk the halls, the shushing and rocking, the tears both mine and hers.

47,Best place to move in California with 2 young kids?,"My wife and I are considering moving to California with our 2 daughters. We're currently in the brainstorming phase. Basically, trying to narrow down to a short list of city candidates. I'm curious if any parents are particularly happy with where they live in CA? Our thought was somewhere in the bay area, but we're open to the rest of CA as well. Here's a bit more context:

I'm American, my wife is German. We met in SF and moved abroad together in 2017. We currently live with her parents in a small village in Bavaria. We both work in tech and our daughters are both under 2. I have family scattered around CA (Sacramento, San Diego, LA, and San Francisco) and grew up in/around the bay area. There's a lot to be said for Bavaria: it's beautiful, safe, my wife's parents are great at being grand parents, and childcare is fully subsidized. But, we both miss the US a lot. We're not 100% sure if we'll make the move, but figured we'd start looking in earnest in case we do.

We were thinking of the bay area due to work opportunities and it being what we know, but the family I have who moved to socal all love it. I am also a bit worried about cost of living in the bay area (and honestly, in CA in general), especially with 2 young kids. I'm hoping us being in tech could help offset all those costs, but it's been a while since I lived in CA so don't have the clearest picture of what our costs to salary would be. Especially with kids. We still need to crunch some numbers.

48,FTM missing my old life,"FTM as of 7 months ago. I love my daughter, I need her but I am not happy with my life. You see, I’m a SAHM who works a full time job. Luckily I get to work from home but the day to day, same ol thing is starting to get to me. My daughter needs so much of my time, most times I can’t get anything done. Her Dad works outside of the house and we have a pretty good relationship (not married yet). But most time I feel like I’m doing everything myself. When he gets home from work, I have a good 20 minutes to myself while he spends his little time with her. Early morning feedings and diaper changes are all on me. I’m not going to lie, I miss my old life and I feel guilty for it because with my old life, there’s no baby and to reiterate, I NEED my baby. I used to be a heavy weed smoker, I quite about 4 months before conceiving and lately I’ve been craving a joint lol. It’s crazy how even with both mom and dad in the household, I’m the one holding the majority of the weight. It’s really starting to get to me. I’m starting to resent my bf. While I’m going through all of these changes, his life hasn’t changed at all. She’s finally asleep after fighting it for a good 2 hours. I think I’ll go out on the balcony for some much needed fresh air after being cooped up inside all day.",z3alvd,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z3alvd/ftm_missing_my_old_life/,parenting
49,Do you mention your losses when you state your number of children?,"Sorry, this is a little sombre, but I'm just curious. My husband and I were discussing it over breakfast. Ah. Married life, eh?

His grandparents have twenty one children; two adopted, nineteen bio - we found out recently they had another bio (their 'firstborn') that they lost during labor. He either passed being delivered or shortly after.

My husband has two younger brothers, one who passed away at three months old. 

We have also had three losses (I say three miscarriages; he says two miscarriages and a stillborn - we were in a car accident and I had an emergency c section in an attempt to save her, but she had already passed away).

His grandparents have only ever said they had twenty one; if you ask them about their lost baby, they will tell you he was never their child and wasn't supposed to be. They won't acknowledge him because they have other children to worry about.

My husbands parents have always said they have three. They don't talk about their middle often, but will tell you his name and everything they knew about him a hundred times over. They love that little boy with everything they have.

My husband is similar to his parents; we have fourteen living children. Generally whenever people ask how many he says ""too many to count"" but if prompted will say seventeen, followed by ""but three are not with us"". 

I don't. If people ask how many I have, I also say something along the lines of ""too many"" or ""a lot"", but thats because people get judgey lol. I do say fourteen otherwise. I think I'd mention them if they passed away after I'd bonded out of the womb, but I didn't have any time with them (and I wasn't interested in cradling my deceased daughter).

Its something we've always disagreed on - not extremely so, but still. I think its inappropriate to tell, often times strangers, that we have three dead kids. It sounds harsh, but its the truth, and no one else needs to know about it. Especially not strangers who are commenting on our kids playing in the park.

He thinks I'm denying them. But, honestly, they don't hold as much place in my heart as my living children do; sure, I cry sometimes, but thats it.

We have their handprints and ashes in a cabinet (along with the ashes and paw prints of our pets, which I think is a nice place for them to be).

I don't know if maybe I'm just less attached than he is - we're both autistic and handle emotions very differently, so it could be that. Still, the conversation mostly ended in curiousity (and a few tears, but then someone pooped so I sent him on his way to hunt down the poopy diaper).

51,Do you consider “trash talk” among kids unacceptable?,"My stepson is 13 and he is very frequently using put-downs on his siblings, cousins, and friends. They play a ton of games so probably 5-10+ times a day I’ll hear him say:

“You’re trash at this”
“You suck”
“You’re a loser”
“You’re a jerk”
“You’re dumb”

Almost everyone he says these things to is younger than him as well. I’m so turned off by it I’ve instituted a one-strike rule: one instance of name-calling or rudeness and the game is over, I don’t care if they just started.

My husband didn’t limit this language at all when we first met. He backs me up when I enforce something but he would never think to say something about it himself and he feels a bit half-hearted so I still feel like the big meanie enforcing it alone. He tells me privately that this is “just boys playfighting” and that I “don’t understand boys”, despite the fact that I have SIX brothers and none of us were ever allowed to talk that way. All of my adult brothers except one are  polite people and never talked this way.

Not so much her brother because he's an infant so she just kinda plays w him when she feels like it and walks off when she's done, but I'm curious if any one else has expirenced anything similar and how you helped your child understand? I've tried explaining and she just has more questions and isn't showing any sort of understanding.

Update: my ex who tried to explain it to her when she was asking about it last night I guess confused her, after sitting down with her and talking to her and explaining that they are still siblings her attitude towards her sister has drastically changed and she's back to snuggling,  playing and sharing her snacks with her sister.

To the point - how do I brush her hair after a shower? I have never done this, and I don’t want to damage it, and it also gets tangled easily. She has straight, fine hair, about to the shoulder blades. I just want to brush it out without damaging it so that she looks and feels nice, and I think both of us could use some help/tips with that. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Should we blow dry it first? Air dry? I’m assuming I shouldn’t brush it to untangle it while it’s still wet.

65,I need advice,"Any advice would be much appreciated.

I have a lot of things going on. So, if you are able to offer any kind of advice regarding ANY of these scenarios, please feel free to contribute. Any sort of advice helps! 

My husband and I have never really had the best marriage. I’ve really tried my best but a long time ago, he had an affair at the beginning of our marriage, and I feel that it’s always been a struggle since then. While we went to many years of marriage counseling, it just was always a bad memory that I held on to in my mind. Other than that, he is a great husband by doing things for me and he is an amazing father to our young children. He just shows no emotional attachment to me and is literally always in a bad mood. 

We bought a house in a place I ended up hating. We sold the house and made nothing on it. We had no money whatsoever and so we had to move in with his parents. I assumed this would be a temporary thing but it has ended up being longer than I had expected. Husband won’t move out. He said that we need to stay with his parents for a minimum of 12-18 months to save some money. I get that we have no money. But I never would have sold our house if I knew we would have to live with them for this long. I have a terrible relationship with my own parents (mother specifically) and I haven’t spoken to them in months. I have not spoken to any of my family members (siblings included) as they are the most non-supportive, critical people I have ever met. I have so much going on in my life and I just couldn’t handle the stress of defending myself to them anymore. So I took a very long, much needed break from them all. 

That being said, I have never had a good relationship with my mother-in-law either since the day I had met her. She never liked me. No matter what I did, it was never acknowledged or appreciated and I was told numerous times that I should stop trying to have a relationship with her. The situation with her is different than it is with my own mother - don’t get it twisted. My mother is in a category of her own and I have legitimate reasons for cutting her off. However, I have tried so hard to have the relationship I have yearned for with my own mother, with my MIL, and she clearly wants nothing to do with me. It’s been extremely awkward and uncomfortable living in a small house with these dynamics. My husband doesn’t care about my feelings on it because he said we have no other place to live and our kids need a roof over their heads. Got it. I know all of this. I don’t want to sound ungrateful and unappreciative for their help because I can’t thank them enough. I don’t have the support from my OWN family, so I am truly appreciative for the help I am receiving. I just don’t understand why my MIL feels the way she does towards me. I try to have conversations with her, I always include her in our outings, even paying for tickets to attend events so she feels included. It’s very uncomfortable for me being in the same room with her, with me trying to always start up conversations and getting one word answers on return. I have no choice but to stay here because I have no place to live. I have no money. 

I guess I am just feeling very overwhelmed and I am venting on this subject because I don’t have my own mother to rely on and knowing how my MIL feels about me, just makes me feel even worse.i find it bothering me a lot when I see her on the phone with her daughter, as well as other family members, laughing and having nonchalant conversations with them. I find myself feeling jealous of their relationships, because I know that she will never want to have that with me. Especially jealous of the relationship she has with her daughter who lives literally thousands of miles away and she never sees. But I am there all of the time and I can’t even get a conversation. It will always be awkward and uncomfortable for me, and that horrible feeling you get inside. 

What does my husband say about this? He says to stop trying to force a relationship with her because he has told me numerous times that she doesn’t want that with me. He tells me to “get over it” especially now, because we have no place to live. I get what he’s saying, but it doesn’t make the bothersome feelings I have within me, go away.

72,"Husband and I have different views on Parenting My Son, his Step Child","Where do I start. 

I'm from the rural south. My parents didn't graduate highschool. There was a lot of dysfunction. I was a hard core drug addict in my adolescents. My life was still pretty messy when I met my husband. 

He's from southern CA. There's dysfunction in his family too, but him and all his siblings graduated highschool and went to college, and most have upper degrees. His parents didn't graduate highschool, but still went back to college later in life. 

He is pretty strict with my son (9 years old currently, but known since he was 5 years old). He says his dad was strict (abusively so he will admit) and that the only way to be sure that you make it to the upper middle class is to have strict discipline. 

It's hard because he is involved with my son. He plays videogames or outside adventures with him, he talks about how he feels, he's adamant that my son's self image is the most important thing. 

But he scares me when it comes to discipline. He yells really loud. One time so loud my son urinated on himself because he was so scared. I get involved and he claims I'm undermine his authority and he's not going to be involved in anything anymore. ""If you want to raise a juvenile delinquent, then you're on your own""

I don't know what to do. It's clear he wants the best for my son. He doesn't care if my son turns out gay, isn't the best student, or even if he curses. He says it's all about behavior. You behave your way to a successful life. 

And he definitely throws in my face that his parents successfully raised eight children that went to college and beyond. My parents couldn't get me out of highschool. He thinks his parenting style is right. 

I just want my kid to feel safe. He wants him to be emotionally tough I guess. 

I don't feel like my thoughts count because I was a real mess when we met. And my son had so much anger at me.  He helped me go back and get my GED. I get to be a SAH Mom if I want or work if I want. I'm living a life I couldn't imagine before met him. He treats me kind. And for the most part he gets along with my son. And my son has improved his behavior a lot. 

I just hate his discipline style. 

Advice. Am I being to emotionally weak 😭

Edit: 

Just to be clear. My son is provided for by my husband. He gets damn near anything he ask for. My husband grew up poor, and doesn't want the same for my son, and I don't think I'm going to do a better job at raising a functioning member of society, but damn.  

Again this is what makes this very tough on me. I want my kid to grow up and have a good life and be a good person, a life I know I couldn't provide him on my own currently.

Additional edit:

People are making comments that I'm only staying because of financial security?

Being poor isn't like being rich except you don't have money. 

It's not only financial security, but more importantly it's security from poor neighborhood bullshit like rampant, fucking rampant violence and crime. Getting better treatment at stores. Not having to bank with security bars and doors. Everyone is so godamn polite and welcoming. I didn't get this before. I used to pray to God, because I absolutely knew my son would go to prison, everyone goes to fcking jail. This upper middle class life has way more perks than just material comfort. Material comfort is on the bottom of that list actually. 

I love my husband because he saw something in me I never saw in myself. True I need therapy to handle myself esteem issues. But damn near everyone I was raised with have horrible self esteem issues. 

If you were raised in a decent enough environment thank you lucky stars but I don't think you'll ever understand what poverty is like. 

So would I trade the life my son has now for the life he was definitely going to have before ...absolutely

I can agree that my husband needs therapy. I came here to see what was normal because no I don't know what was is normal, based on the feedback I now know it's excessive.

73,family members used to give me gifts to give my children for xmas 'from Santa'. nope.,"My father was famous for this. Hed buy my kids a bunch of gifts labeled from santa. I didnt like that. In my opinion, I wanted my kids to know their grandpa loves them and took the time to go buy them gifts, not that grandpa doesnt give a shit and some magical fairy man loves and cares for them so much.

In my household, santa brought clothes, socks, tshirts. Maybe some small toys n such, but the gifts under the tree were labeled from family members. As a kid I hated that santa brought me all this cool stuff but my wealthy father only ever got me socks, a crate of faygo, maybe a VHS tape. I wanted things to be different for my kids.

My family was not accepting of my take on xmas for years after I became a parent. I think it really struck home when my father gave me a gift wrapped for my son from santa and I re wrapped it from grandpa and when my son next saw my father he jumped on him excitedly telling him how much fun he had with his new Lego set and how awesome it was and my dad smiled and glowed in his way.

I'll deal with gifts from 'santa'. But if you love my kids and care enough to go buy them a birthday present, or a christmas present, I want them to know that.

Edit: used my father as an example and many of you are turning this post into daddy issues so let me add on. My eldest sister used to throw a christmas at her house two weeks or so before christmas. Presents from santa under the tree. My mother sends gifts across the country for my children and I, sometimes from santa. My little sister will bring wrapped presents without names on them, she will hand them to you directly. I appreciate that of her.

This is my preference, and how my household handles christmas. It is a time for love, togetherness, and family. Sure, santa is still in the mix, an angel on the top of the tree, and midnight mass xmas eve. Christmas jingles, decorations, real xmas trees and NEEDLES EVERYWHERE for months. But santa should not be the FOCUS of christmas. Family should be, and in my household, it is.",z2vnsc,2,84,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z2vnsc/family_members_used_to_give_me_gifts_to_give_my/,parenting
74,Daughter always shouting “NO DADA”,"My 2.5yo daughter is a fickle thing. She can be very cuddly but she has to be extremely comfortable with you. She doesn’t seem to have sensory issues otherwise. I’m her main caretaker, but her dad works from home so he sees her often. Over the past month she’s abruptly stopped wanting her dad to come near her. Normally she’d be happy to give him a big hug after daycare, and sometimes she still acts happy to see him, but then he tries to come near and she shouts “NO DADA” and won’t let him come close. It happens even at bedtime when she would normally give him a hug and a kiss (she doesn’t even like to kiss me goodnight). We don’t understand where it’s coming from, and it’s beginning to push my husband away. He still tries but then acts defeated and walks away. I’ve told her “be nice to dada, that makes him sad. We don’t shout at dada”. She seems to be contemplating it and feels bad but doesn’t change her behavior. 

I know what some of you may be thinking, but my husband is very kind and gentle with her and I trust wholeheartedly that he hasn’t done something behind my back to hurt her. He can be a little clueless about personal boundaries, like getting too close to her when I can sense she’d like space. I blame this on him being an only child, but who knows.

The only thing I can think of is that she’s been in the hospital a couple of times over the last two months, one for stitches (banged her lip on the coffee table) and the other for an IV with flu. Both times she had to be held down by multiple people for painful procedures. But I was the one helping hold her down, not him. 
My only other thought is that I’m 5 months pregnant, and we tell her the baby is coming, but she doesn’t seem to understand or care. She is, however, constantly saying “my mama” to him (and everyone we encounter), so seeming a bit possessive. 

I really appreciate any insight you all may have.",z33t87,0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z33t87/daughter_always_shouting_no_dada/,parenting
75,Head Hitting During Tantrums,"About 3 months ago my song turned 3 years old. He is constantly into everything, so we are in a constant state of redirection and threatening to send him to bed or time out. Just recently he's started to hit his head on things like the floor or wall when he throws a tantrum. Our response is a mix between ignoring him and scolding him and telling him to not hurt himself; be nice to himself. I had a small lecture with him one night in bed after he hit his head on his bed post and I thought he understood what I was saying... as good as a toddler can... but last night when we threatened to send him to bed after pulling his sisters hair he ran to the fireplace and threw his head down on the cement/stone step up to it. I was shocked and gasped. I think he immediately regretted it, but I couldn't be sure since he was in the middle of a tantrum at the time. I'm tired of redirecting, I'm tired of his tantrums, I'm tired of being woken up at 2 am to a tantrum, and I'm tired of him hurting himself. I'm not sure what I can do for him to make him understand that he needs to get some semblance of control over himself. I feel awful that he's hurt himself; he has 4 bruises on his head. I need to figure out how to get him to stop and express himself in another way that isn't hurting anyone.",z2xp36,2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z2xp36/head_hitting_during_tantrums/,parenting

I’m curious because the sound “shhh” is inherently soothing to infants trying to fall asleep.

77,Car Seat Placement,"Hi! I hope this is an okay place to post this. My fiancé and I are expecting our first little one.. my due date is today actually! We just installed the base and infant car seat in my car (I have a 2021 Mazda CX-5). We’re a little puzzled by how cramped it is! We installed it on the passenger side in the backseat. My fiancé is 6’2 and definitely won’t have enough space to sit in the front seat in front of it if I’m driving. I’m only 5’1 so maybe it would work better behind me… However I feel like it makes more sense to keep it there versus behind me for when I’m driving alone with the baby?! Am I missing something? We have the Nuna Pipa RX car seat. 

Let me know how you usually have yours installed. Maybe my car just isn’t as big as I thought? Is it already time for a mini van LOL?

78,Pros and cons of being a SAHM,"I, 26f, have a husband 33m and 3 sons,  10y, 6y, and 4m. 

Hubby works full time making good money. Enough to cover our expenses and still have a little leftover. I work part time, nights and it just doesn't seem worth it to do it right now. Hes told me a few times that im more valuable at home helping with the kids than i am there, earning next to nothing in comparison. I don't necessarily want to be a SAHM, i honestly hate the idea. But I'm burning out working nights. And if we put the baby in day care, my entire paycheck plus some of hubby's would be going to that, so it seems like a waste of money. So, I'm considering quitting to prioritize my kids and husband.

 We've had discussions about me getting some type of certification to get a decent job, but I'm not settled on anything yet. I manage our finances, so I'm not concerned about thus turning into a controll situation with him. He has nothing but respect for me. We're just at the end of our ropes.

79,Life without mom (update from a 2020 post),"I've got 5 kiddos, 12 and under. Their mom and I went through divorce in the height of Covid in early 2020 which was a nightmare but such a blessing too.  We were together 15 years but divorce truly was for the best and I felt so relieved, she made everyone's life hell.  At the time of separation (in early 2020), CPS got involved and deemed her unfit to parent due to proven abuse and neglect of our kids (during our separation) and her severe mental illnesses (spanned for years) that she wouldn't care for, not to mention her very long history of suicide attempts as well.  I was given full custody of our kids and our marital home in may 2020.  She immediately fled (in may 2020) and moved in with a new boyfriend, which has since become her husband.  

She called our children off and on from random phones from july 2020 till october 2020.  Every phone call the kids would plead and beg of her to come back around and visit them.  She's such a heartless narcissist though that she only cared about boasting about her new life and how great it was.  We broke off contact when she would call boasting happily about how she was expecting a ""new brother or sister"" and how she ""was moving to Florida"" (we live in Michigan).  They've since moved to Florida, she's been replacing our children's memory because they're currently on baby #3.  I only know any of this becasue of facebook info...  There's been no contact between us, she won't respond to any emails and has blocked my main social media accounts.   She abandoned our five children, fled to florida and started an entirely new family.
Myself and my children have all been in family and individual therapy since this all started and will continue to do so for quite some time.

In early 2021 my oldest child verbally told his therapist in detail about the physical abuse his mother imposed on him and his siblings in the 2 months that the lived with her during our separation period while divorce started in early 2020.  This was news to me and my children decided to harbor those details for some reason until then. It made me feel happy knowing they felt safe enough to open up though.  Even know the therapist knew their mother was out of the picture, they still had to call CPS they claimed.  CPS came out and told me the physical abuse allegations against my ex wife.  They even took a statement from my oldest child which broke my heart more to put him through talking about that again.  The CPS worker told me that they fully intended to prosecute my ex which I agreed with and that they'd be in touch with Police in the city she was believed to be living in.  They couldn't find her though and CPS had to drop the case.

Then in Mid 2021 the state scheduled a court hearing and ordered her to appear to explain why she hadn't paid a dime of child support.  She didn't show and they issued a bench warrant.  Fast forward a year till last month (in 2022), the court has now issued a felony warrant for her for not paying a dime of child support for over 2 years now.  It's very strange to think that she's building a life with a brand new family, and that she's eventually going to be arrested and charged with a felony, and the fact that those new kids will have to grow up for a while without a mother too.  

Regardless of all the drama, my kids are healthy and happy most of the time.  They're safe and loved and that's all that matters to me.  I admit, I sometimes blame myself for making a family with such a monster at all.  I know I could have never known how the future would play out all those years ago when I met her in 2005.  I just wish she would have been an honorable woman after divorce and still wanted to be in our children's lives.  Although EVERY single last person that knew her all unanimously have said that it's for the best that she's gone out of their lives...    I try to take peace in that...

80,Cavities! Help!,"My eldest has never had a cavity in his life, I've never had a cavity, but my youngest had 3 last year at his checkup and last night I saw a new one!  

I brush his teeth very well in the morning and before bed with toothpaste, he doesn't really eat candy, and doesn't drink sodas ever.  I work all day and can't make sure he brushes his teeth after lunch.  

Has anyone found a solution that helps?  I've been told that it's saliva exchange that might be causing it, but no one shares food with him, and he's not the type to put anything in his mouth that doesn't belong there.  

He's almost 5.  Should I get him using children's antibacterial mouth rinses?

81,Too much energy,"My eldest son is 8 and has always had a lot of energy. He can't sit still, always plays very loud and very agitated games etc. We offer him lots of ways to invest his energy: he swims once a week, plays basketball three times a week and  boy scouts activities on Sunday. But now he fell and bruised his backbone. He has to stay calm for a couple of weeks, shouldn't do any sports (not even swimming) nor run or play in an agitated manner, but this is almost impossible for him. He manages to stay calm for a few days, but after that he just bounces of the walls because of his excess of energy. He gets so agitated that he just jumps around all the time. This has caused him to fall again, hurting his backbone again and prolonging his  healing time. Does anyone know any tricks for an 8 year old to lose (alot of) excess energy without actually moving around alot?

83,Separation Anxiety 20months old,"I guess I’m just looking for advice/encouragement because i am beyond exhausted. My 20 month old son is experiencing what I believe separation anxiety. And for the past month I am his favorite. He refuses to sleep on his own for naps or bedtime. At first it was waking up every couple of hours, and all I had to do was rock him for 5 minutes then back down. That’s doable but the past week it’s regular bedtime at 8:30pm then he’s up at 11pm and then it’s a crying fit until 4am. The last few days we said screw it and hung out in the living room and him and I would just pass out on the couch until 8am. I’ve tried bringing him into our bed but he screams and kicks dad out but when dad leaves he’s screaming “daddy!!” But hanging out in the living room and sleeping in the couch together is fine(?) 

I suspect his canines are coming in. But im thinking about going to his pediatrician since it’s been about month and the last week and half has gotten worse. I know separation anxiety is normal for toddlers and infants but I want to make sure nothing serious is wrong with him. 

With all that being said, I. Am. SO. Effing. Tired. I understand he loves me and I do soak up the moments of cuddles and kisses when he feels safe with me. Trust me, I love and appreciate these moments as I know they’ll be over before I know it. But, I am still tired. I don’t work well without enough sleep. I am a licensed massage therapist going to school learning more modalities such as reflexology and sacred sound healing.

84,1 week old eating more than recommended.,"I had my baby girl a week ago, I initially wanted to breastfeed/pump like I did with my first but due to a severe case of mastitis and extreme pain I’ve given up and she’s now been on formula for 2 days. (Which is absolutely fine with me, as long as she’s fed!). 

The problem is, when I was breastfeeding/pumping she was drinking about 100-120mls (3-4fl oz) every 3 hours but the formula suggests that I only give her 60mls (2fl oz). It’s just not filling her up and I’ve been having to feed her more often, sometimes she’ll finish the bottle and start searching for my boob or suckling for more. So I’ve been doubling up for the first morning feed and the night feed before bed. 

Is this normal that she wants more or am I over feeding my baby?

This would mean that she always is half asleep, always on alert, because she’s the one who hears or has to make sure that she hears her baby cry and wakes up to check baby, every single time. Then if she needs help, she has to wake her husband. The husband gets to sleep relaxed and not be on alert and have to wake his wife because he needs help with the baby. Why is it this way? It can become this way, right? A mum doesn’t have to be the one who wakes up when the baby sleeps, the dad should equally wake up to check the baby while he lets his wife sleep, even just for 5 minutes longer, and she can be woken for help with the baby instead.",z2cu7o,26,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z2cu7o/my_random_thoughts_by_me_about_a_new_mothers/,parenting
88,I complained on my son’s teacher and need advice!!,"
I complained on my son’s temp/sub teacher who’s supposed to he teaching them for several months to the principal.

She called him racist because he moved away when he touched her..which he said some kids in his class heard. He told me to ask them if I didn’t believe him. And gave a name.

I emailed the principal directly. She said she’d get back to me but she didn’t.

Second incident happened where the entire class called him gay and laughed, my son said no I’m not and was quite upset at the bullying..then she insisted my son was gay in front of everyone, saying it’s okay to be gay. He said he wasn’t. She says it’s okay I know you are.

I was livid. I emailed the principal again. Told her no one got back to me. I expect a reply and an action play. She apologized a lot and said she forgot and was terribly sorry. 

She said she would investigate again..

She called me the next day after speaking to my son and said he said nothing happened again. I asked him why he said no and yes to me. He said he was too embarrassed and I could ask his friends to confirm. That he would be comfortable bringing a friend to speak to the principal with him.

He said he wasn’t lying and to ask his friends. I asked two of his friends on text and they both explained the exact same story as my son.

I told her he was embarrassed and that his friends on text basically told me it did happen. She asked me to email the screenshots which I did. And did not hear from her after this…

Then..

A few days later the teacher wanted a parent teacher interview.. She basically made up “lies?” that my son says he’s adopted and that we aren’t his real parents. She said she checked his school records to see if he was adopted and even asked the principal this because he kept saying it.

She kept going on about this even though I said no over and over. In the end I said maybe he was joking, I don’t know.. she said “exactlyyy he’s joking.” 


I asked my son and he said he never said that. My son sent his friend a text asking if he ever heard him say that in class, he said never.


Then she asked if he plays video games everyday and I told her no. She said he comes and says he does. Everyday he plays an hour apparently. I kept saying no no and she continued her interrogation. I said we only give video games on the weekend. She asked if he plays gta because he talks about it in class.. I said sometimes then her response was that’s a very violent game you know, it’s not age appropriate. I said he plays on a mode where you can do tasks and not do violent things. 

I don’t understand why she felt the need to attack me for retaliation purposes.

But my conscience is bugging me if I did the right thing..in the end I wasn’t there. Maybe I should have spoken to her before going to the principal.

I probably look like a complete ass to the principal now and worrying if I ruined my kids reputation at school.

I agree I let my bias get a hold of me - after covid basically anyone with a high school diploma can become a temp teacher. Even the principal told me some go through the non traditional route and have a lot of learning to do.

In the end, I wasn’t there. I am going by what my son and the kids said..

Should I apologize to the teacher and clear her name with the principal? I have no idea.

91,Is it bad to be the oldest toddler in daycare?,"Hi folks, we have a 3 year old boy who spent the first two years at home with us during the pandemic. We were fortunate to have flexible jobs that allowed us to work from home during the height of Covid. However, because of that, he didn’t start daycare until 2 years old, which made for a really difficult transition (one of the hardest our daycare provider had seen). He tends to be really shy, especially around strangers—and part of it may be genetics, part of it may be that we kept ourselves fairly isolated for 2 years. 

Anyway, when he turned 2 we tried putting him in a larger Montessori school, but he was traumatized by the experience, so we pulled him out and went with a smaller in-home daycare so it wouldn’t be as intimidating of an environment. 

Fast forward a year and our daycare provider has to decided to retire in a few months. We’re struggling with deciding whether we enroll him in another in-home daycare that we really like (where he would be the oldest by about 6 months or so—the rest of the children would be under 2 years of age). Or, whether we should enroll him in more of a pre-school environment where he’ll be with kids that are closer in age.

Our biggest concern is that he would “age out” quickly at the in-home daycare, especially if the older 2.5 year olds move to pre-school anytime soon.

99,What were the best ways you tired your toddler out without overly tiring yourself out?,"So I’m asking not to ask how to eliminate being tired or touched out all together since we all know that’s impossible. But as my baby gets older it’s going to be something I am going to  be thinking about more- preventing being OVERLY touched out, being Unnecessarily burnt out more than you realized you maybe needed to be. 

This can be its own question without explanation, but I’m also asking this for a specific reason as well:

I’ve seen one post from a parent  whos recent injury prevented them from actively playing with their 2 year old and it got me thinking of moms with physical limitations that they can’t get on the floor and be treated like a human jungle gym (considering this is the very thing they say lead to them feeling touched out anyway). But it made me realize how many parents physically can’t match the toddlers energy all day or even pick them up for long stretches. They have to get creative with how to spend time with their toddlers that doesn’t risk their own physical health. 

I myself am also a very low energy person with back problems so I worry how this may translate when the baby is another year older and is requiring more physical play that i may not be able to keep up with day in and day out. 

So for moms who have an injury/physical health concerns, heavily pregnant with the next kid, or simply don’t have the energy to physically play with their toddlers, what were the activities you did that allowed some kind of rest while your kid burned their energy that day?

Did you just take them to the park?

Did you sit and blow bubbles for them to chase?

Did you give them a scavenger hunt to find items around the house to return to you?

These are just some examples parents gave me here and there, but i’d like to hear more any specific activities your kid did while preserving your own energy as best as you could.

(i realize a partner to take over may be an obvious answer, but i’m referring more to a situation where they are not able to be around and you are watching the kids all day.)

(A lot of parents are nervous how not physically letting them all over you will show them they aren’t loved, but obviously we need space as parents and can’t be holding them 24/7 for many reasons as listed above. We can’t subject ourselves to be human jungle gyms every day, so this post is asking about that specific fear too- how to allow some sanity and rest while still showing the kid you love them and like to play, even if that doesn’t look like you being treated like Mount Everest.

102,"Responsibilities - one parent working full-time, the other not","A bit of context, we have only one daughter who's almost one year old. I'm sure many people here have it way harder and have multiple kids so hopefully I can get some good advice.

I'm working 40+ hours a week, with a fairly stressful job (software engineer), earning a much higher salary. My partner is gradually going back to work, currently working only one day per week (it's been 2 weeks now). We are gradually sending our daughter to daycare.

I'm very involved with our daughter, I work all day then generally care for her when my partner prepares dinner, spend time playing with her. Now sometimes help for the bath, often put her to sleep. I feel crushed after a day of work + taking care of my baby. When my girlfriend works, I take care of my daughter in the morning while my partner gets ready. I'm almost 100% responsible of finances, I give money to my partner to compensate for the fact that she doesn't work (almost) to care for our daughter. I feel overwhelmed with the responsibilities. I have lots of anxiety in general and I'm seing a therapist to help with that.

We sleep separately since I need good quality sleep because of my brain intensive job, our daughter still wakes up during the night and my partner currently handles that. She mostly takes care of meals for our daughter, laundry for her (I still do mine). She's still breastfeeding. Partner is gradually going to work more, eventually 2 days per week, eventually 3. Of course she takes care of our baby when I'm working and she's not in daycare, but we're planning on sending her to daycare full-time.

I was surprised about a few things, here's 2 examples that kinda drives me nuts
- after coming back from her first day of work, she was surprised I had not prepared anything for dinner, she came home and I had just finished my day
- yesterday I was surprised when she asked me if I could drive out daughter to daycare once a week, even when she's not working. I WFH and daycare is a 25 minutes drive, really close to where my partner works. So it would take roughly 1h in the morning to do that.

I feel a bit of resentment towards her, I feel like she should be the one helping alleviate the stress on my side, but she's wants to add more to my plate while I'm already overwhelmed. I told her, she knows. I don't feel like being intimate with her because of these feelings. I will definitely talk to her when my anger is going to feel better. 

How do people manage responsibilities with multiple kids? I feel like I'm barely holding on and we just have a little girl. Any idea how I can make things better?

Edit: some feedback has been interesting and helped me put things into perspective, on the other side there seems to be some angry downvoting which I don't give a damn.

103,Expectations- 13 months attention span?,"Hey everyone. Just a quick question about what the attention span of their 13 month old is/was? I'd like to cut my daughter some slack if I can. I keep thinking she is somewhat abnormal? She is very active and physically ahead for her age so I'm thinking that could be it (walking at 10 months, now climbing on and off beds and stairs and couches at 13 months). It's been more difficult lately as where I live it is full winter with ice and snow and cold temps so our usual outside time has been cut back.

For example, I will try and stack blocks with her, and she will stack them twice, hit them down, and then run away to something else. I tried to read her a book just now, and all she wants to do is turn the pages quickly and then pushes the book away. I've tried super crazy pronunciation and pointing to things, asking her where something is, and she is interested for a moment but then usually flips the pages and then wiggles out of my arms to another toy/activity. 

Another example could be during mealtime, she will sit in her highchair for 5-10min MAX (usually on the 5min side), gobble stuff down and then say ""done"" and scream and thrash until we let her out. 

Normal? I am feeling pretty burnt out from the inability of her to chill lol.",z2vh1m,0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z2vh1m/expectations_13_months_attention_span/,parenting

My boyfriend rescued the chihuahua about 7 yrs ago from the pound & he’s very grumpy & mean to strangers he shits himself when he goes to the vet & tries to bite the vet we have to sedate him anytime he’s getting his nails cut or getting vaccines dental work literally everything he tries to bite strangers & guest if you try petting him not sure what that dog experienced prior to getting adopted but he basically only likes me & my bf he’s nice to about 5 family members & friends that he’s seen constantly but anyone else he’s ready to attack. The chihuahua loved laying on my belly when I was pregnant so I assumed hed grow to be besties with our baby but every time I put my son near the dog the chihuahua constantly growls at him. My 7 month old is now crawling all over the place & is obsessed with the dogs (I also have a Yorkie) the Yorkie doesn’t try to bite him he kinda just avoids the baby. Today the baby was crawling around my bedroom laying in the Yorkies bed then he notices the chihuahuas in his lil cave bed & goes straight to crawling to him I didn’t think the chihuahua would bite him but he growled & snapped at him as if he was going to bite him (he didn’t) but I’m just scared that one day he actually will & I know if he does bite the baby we’d have to put him down & I don’t want that. I see all kinds of babies & their pets cuddling & just looking like bestfriends & I want that for them so bad but my chihuahua is just so grumpy & mean does anyone have any suggestions?

I always give my son the opportunity to say yes/no when invited and this time he decided he would go. The day of the party my son changed his mind and decided he would rather hang out with other friends. I made him go since he had made the commitment and it is a birthday party meaning they already paid for him to participate in the activities. 

A couple hours into the party my son texts me that he wants to come home- birthday boy tried to kiss him. Multiple times. My son said that he finally had to get physical and push him away in a forceful way to get the point across at which point the kid begged him not to leave the party. 

I picked up my son, but now am struggling with how to address it with the other parent.  I had just told him that my son wasn’t feeling well so we were bringing him home. I certainly don’t want to out a kid, but also- No. Means. No. To keep trying and not respect that Ace wasn’t interested is a problem that needs to be addressed.

She’s also acting out at school - doesn’t listen to the rules on what she is supposed to be doing and keeping her hands to herself. She’ll push and say the other kid did it first.

 my friend is with her daughter 24/7. She is a SAHM who is attending classes online, and also has a boyfriend who works out of town and only is able to come home for 4 days every other week.

117,Has anyone changed their baby’s name…a year in?,"My daughter is just under a year old and I’m seriously considering changing her name.

I’m not going to include her real name here because it’s a very uncommon name (nothing with creative spelling or anything, just a very old German name). And I’m worried my husband might see this. We’ve discussed my worries about her name but asking the internet is another thing. 

The problem is that we simply never, ever use her real name. Literally from birth we called her a nickname derived from her real name. (Think “Gwen” for Guinevere). No family members use her real name. We have friends that probably don’t even know her name. Her real name feels awkward when we say it. It feels formal and slightly alien. 

Also, 9/10 people mispronounce it. I can’t believe I didn’t see this coming. The pronunciation seems obvious to me but obviously it isn’t. We kept the name a secret until she was born but I wish we hadn’t because then I would have known most people don’t say it the way we expect. 

I chose the name. My husband happily agreed to it and says he likes it but again, he doesn’t ever use it. Just the nickname. I initially loved the name but now it feels like a clunky, embarrassing misstep. Every time we introduce her by her nickname it feels like acknowledging I messed up and gave her a name that didn’t “take.” 

The worst, most stupid, most embarrassing part is that I myself, her mother, am like…not totally sure how I want to pronounce it 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ when I force myself to use her full name, I sometimes randomly hesitate and say it differently. Since she was born I’ve also come across different ways to pronounce it and it’s as if my brain can’t decide how to do it anymore. 

I just want to stop here and note that you cannot possibly be rolling your eyes at me harder that I’ve rolled them at myself. I know not being 100% sure how to pronounce your own child’s name is next-level stupid. 

I don’t want her to grow up feeling estranged from her own first name because no one ever calls her that. But I also feel like it would be bizarre to change her name at this point? It would feel like catering to other people’s convenience, in a way, and it’s not like we have zero attachment to her real name. It is the name we chose for our baby girl, after all. 

If we did change it, I’d want to change it to something very similar so she’d still be able to go by her current nickname. I just also want to not feel weird and awkward about my own kid’s real name, you know? 

She currently responds to her nickname but we can’t really tell if she knows her real name. She’s not talking yet.

My baby has pretty bad reflux, so bad we have medication for it. We do literally everything we are supposed to: baby eats upright, 30 min plus of sitting upright after eating, preemie nipples on a anti colic and reflux bottle with breastmilk. Get adequate burps and wait a long time after eating to do tummy time. 

We were 2+ hours after eating, but we spit up 6 times in those almost 9 minutes of tummy time. So 6 times I flipped her back on her back, cleaned her and the mat up and tried again. She would spit up and be fine emotionally but I was afraid she would choke on it. We ended early because the last spit up caused a pain cry for 10 minutes. During tummy time I have a light up piano that makes music that i sit behind to encourage her to lift her head. She does it sometimes and sometimes looks side to side, but it feels like were predominantly just chilling on our tummy or being a struggle baby on our tummy (flexing misc muscles). Internet says I'm supposed to do 20 minutes of tummy time.  I have no idea how we can possibly get to 20 minutes, we're lucky to get 2 without the pain reflux. Any advice?

UPDATE: my son has been seen by the doctor. He had a fever of 39.2, we have a shortage of children’s Tylenol and Advil here in Ontario Canada, so they got the pharmacist at the hospital to mix some Tylenol and Advil and gave it to my son to bring down his fever. The doctor listened to his lungs and said they are clear. He said it’s gastroenteritis and are giving him a prescription. They also said we can give him gravol. They are waiting for his fever to go down now and monitoring it before my son can leave.",z2p8n2,1,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z2p8n2/parents_with_kids_who_had_pneumonia_does_this/,parenting
123,Best ways to stop my 12 month old from biting?,"At first it was cute, but now it's painful and far too frequent and lord knows if it's happening at daycare.

I'm not above spanking, but I do feel like they're too young for that. At the same time I can tell them ""no"" or ""stop"" all day long, but it's not like they understand what I'm saying. Sure, they might be able to sense my frustration, but they don't get why I'm upset

So annoying. Anyway the next person that did it we let them know the same thing and they would clearly offended and didn’t interact with my daughter for the rest of the night.

128,I feel like such a shit mum lately,"I feel stupid even writing this but I just can’t shake the feeling of feeling like a crap mum lately. Multiple times today I was tearing up looking at them and just not feeling like enough. 
I have an almost 2.5yo and almost 10mo. It could be the adjustment from going from having all the time in the world to myself to just abit of time with my first baby and then before I fully got the hang of it got pregnant again and now have zero time to myself. My baby doesn’t sleep great. Twice in almost 10 months he’s slept in til 5 (with night wakes) but other than that I’m up multiple times a night and holding him from atleast 4am onwards if not well before and then if my toddler wakes up I have to go in to try settle her too which wakes him since he won’t go back to sleep in his cot when I put him down but I can’t just leave her screaming. 

Plus I just feeling crap not doing much with them in the day besides going to the park or a quick walk to the shops because I’m so tired and find it hard getting out with 2 kids plus not much money for something which would be easy to keep them occupied, plus sometimes with naps or doesn’t line up with my babies multiple naps and toddlers midday nap, I’m a crap cook and my toddler is so picky and hard to get much time to even cook with them both around and I hate serving up the same thing constantly and just feel like I’m not doing good enough. Then just looking at myself still abit overweight and looking a mess from having babies and not having time to even do any self care for myself unless I stay up late which seems stupid when I’ve barely slept the previous night and once I tidy up their mess and bottles etc it’s time for bed and won’t be long til my babies first wake of the night begins.

I used to be the type to love working out. I wish so bad they just both slept til 6:30 so I could wake at 5 and have time to myself and workout. That would be a dream. I know oneday it will happen but it’s so fucking hard. Nothing is mine anymore. I can barely pee without being whinged at let alone eat. The house is a mess. I spend the whole day tidying up after the little messes they makes and doing the basic chores however the house is still a mess at the end of the day. I just feel like a shit mum and even shittier wife. 
My husband helps with shower/bath time which helps and does what he can but he works night shift, has to sleep in the day and also studies so his time is limited. Some parts of some days are honestly torturous for me at times. Not all the day but parts of the day. When I have them 1 on 1 its so easy and I love having time with them and they’re happy. But most the time it’s both of them and it’s just so hard. I wish I could split myself into 2 to be there for them how they want. 

Maybe I’m just being a sook and need to get over it and do my job and lose a little more sleep. But I’m just struggling and don’t get how todo it all let alone even half of what I think I should be doing. I try things like meal prep or workout with the kids but doesn’t last long and I get a 30 second workout in. Everything just feels so hard right now. 

Any advice or just assurance that it isn’t just me is welcome.

130,Book on ADHD for 7 year old,"My son was recently diagnosed with ADHD. It is very obvious that something is wrong with him, he is eloping from class constantly (to the point where he spends entire days trying to leave the school building…. 9+ times a day. We have his teacher send us a daily report), and he is very confused about why his brain isn’t working correctly. He calls it his bad brain and he can’t control it. It breaks my heart.

Anyways, since we have finally gotten his official diagnosis and will be starting medication soon (I would be pushing it off if he wasn’t an eloper but it is a safety issue and it is affecting his schooling since he doesn’t attend class as much as he just tries to run away from class). We haven’t yet sat him down to talk to him about this diagnosis and what it means for him. Mostly because we have 3 kids and want to arrange some one in one time to explain it to him, which will be happening over thanksgiving break. 

Does anyone have any book recommendations to help him understand? And to help him maybe feel less alone? He struggles with reading (like many who have ADHD) but even if it is something that we can read to him, it would be appreciated.

132,My 4 years old son is misbehaving and keeps hitting us to get attention,"Hello fellow parents, I'm 35yo, I'm a father of two, my oldest is a 9yo daughter and although she had her issues but she was much easier to handle. Lately my 4yo son has been misbehaving a lot. 

Whenever he wants attention he would do all possible things to annoy us. 

* He would hit his sister or us (parents).
* He tries to touch our private parts because we told him not to.
* He would try to grab my glasses.
* He takes stuff (cellphones or cups for example) and throw them.
* Put small stuff in his mouth and laugh at our panic that he would choke to death!

Basically he would do anything to annoy us. I tried:

* Telling him calmly to stop. But he ignores me and continue misbehaving.
* Giving him attention. But he takes that as a chance to grab my glasses or touch me on my private part.
* Raising my voice at him. But he giggles.
* Threatening him with punishment. But he ignores me.

Today I did something that I deeply regret and I hope that I didn't scar him, I slapped his hand hard when he touched my private part. He stopped. 20 minutes later he put a plastic bottle cap that he took from the kitchen in his mouth, we told him to spit it out and he laughed, we yelled at him, he continues laughing. I lost it and smacked him on his bottom twice then pushed him to the ground. He didn't cry but the pain made him stop.

I know that this was completely wrong of me, I know better, I should not hit my kids.

Please let me know how to handle my kid, I don't want to ever hit him again. I know that some of you may judge me for hitting my kid, I'm already beating myself over it.",z25yni,11,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z25yni/my_4_years_old_son_is_misbehaving_and_keeps/,parenting

135,8 year old has trouble sleeping,"My 8 year old daughter has recently been having trouble going to sleep and it's slowly become worse and worse. She used to fall asleep around 8pm and now it's more like 10pm, last night it was 11pm! There doesn't seem to be anything that has triggered it, she is doing really well in school, has a great friendship group and we are a very happy little family (she is an only child so it's just her, my partner and me)
She eats dinner, has a bath, plays for 30mins in her room and then she reads or we read to her for 30mins. It used to be lights out at 8pm and then she would fall asleep. When the trouble started she would complain she couldn't sleep so we told her to read a while longer and turn out the light when she got sleepy. She would do this but then get really stressed that she couldn't fall asleep, we would put on a sleep meditation which worked for a while. She then claimed the sleep meditations were keeping her awake and she would be very upset and stressed that couldn't get to sleep and would become inconsolable and angry and her emotions would be all over the place. As it was taking her so long to get to sleep I wondered if her bedtime was too early so moved lights out to 8.30pm. This hasn't worked either. I've tried going in to check on her every 5mins after lights out. I've bought her a mattress topper as she said her bed was too hard (which ended with her wanting to sleep on the floor because her bed was too soft). 
I have run out of ideas! I'm so worried about her not getting enough sleep! 
Her father died when she was 2 and she can't really remember him and my partner has been in the picture since she was 4 so I don't think its related but wondering if there might be big emotions she doesn't understand causing this???

136,Four year old suddenly wetting the bed ?,"I forget what time my son potty trained, but it was around the typical age. This time last year is when he started being able to go through the night with no accidents and it’s been smooth sailing. 

In the past few months however he’s had maybe 3 day time accidents. I took it as him having a lot of fun and not wanting to stop what he was doing (I remember doing that in first grade). 

But now in the past three weeks, he’s peed the bed twice at night. Which is very concerning. He’s never had this problem and went almost a full year without a bedtime accident. There’s been many nights where he’s chugged water before bed and been fine, and many nights where he’s woken me up to help him go pee. 

But he peed the bed again tonight. Four hours after bedtime, even though he peed twice before bed, and didn’t have water. 

Has anyone experienced this, what’s your take ? I asked him if it hurt when he pees (although he’s never mentioned it) and he said yes all over but only a little and wouldn’t show me where, so I plan to ask again, thinking maybe he was just agreeing.

He HAS had a really rough year with big changes. His dad randomly stopped coming for him and moved (we’ve been separated since he was an infant), me and him moved in with my partner who’s he’s known for over two years, and I had a baby four months ago. And honestly there was a lot of fighting for a few months, which has since calmed down, but I know it’ll take a long time to build the trust back for him in my partner. 

Has anyone else been through this? What do I do? I feel so bad, I cleaned him and the mattress and now he’s sleeping next to me. I’ll have a talk with him about not drinking before bed and I’ll do more potty checks. I also already made an intake therapy appointment so we can help him work through his dad leaving and some of his other stressors. I don’t know if I should make a pediatrician appointment to rule out anything physical even though I would guess it’s stress. Could sugar be behind this too? 

I just want him to feel good and he gets so sad when he pees. Anything is helpful. Thank you.",z2gfb3,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z2gfb3/four_year_old_suddenly_wetting_the_bed/,parenting

139,Encouraging Perfect Pitch - pitch-accurate baby/toddler piano?,"**** update added towards the bottom

Hi all, I'm a father of a 10-month-old, looking to nurture musical interest and encourage perfect pitch.


I'm just wondering if anyone is aware of pitch-accurate piano/keyboard (/toys) suitable for maybe 10-12 month *****onwards*****.  


not talking about anything fancy (though am equally interested).

we have piano toys, but either it's a case of you can press the same key over and over and it plays all the different notes of a song, or there's just 4 keys that are numbered 1-4 and the notes are flat and not equal intervals.  


 Baby Einstein Magic Touch Piano would have been perfect (feel free to take a look to see what I mean.  I haven't linked so-as-to adhere to the subreddit rules), except for comments that all the notes are a quarter-tone off, the black keys are the same notes as the white keys, and the pitch can vary between identical devices. Otherwise, it's age appropriate (6-36 months) and has a full octave by the looks of it.  


(I appreciate I will likely get lots of comments critiquing the fact I'm even asking this, my intentions vs my child's age etc. etc., or of course the 'why don't you X instead'.  I'll just say right now, I appreciate in advance your time, but if your response isn't actually answering my question, I won't be engaging with it.)


*****************
*******Update: thank you to those who gave thoughtful and useful responses.*****

Honestly.... what is wrong with some people...

I have perfect pitch and, as a singer (primarily), have found it VERY useful, especially in musical theatre etc. Where I have had to come straight into a song where there's been no reference notes etc. And it starts acapella. I've been in shows where people have had to have someone play the note for them off-stage and they've tried their best to keep it in their head.... Yes people can get by, people can be amazing without, but IF my little boy decides he would like to be a musician and/or singer when he grows up, I want to do what I can subliminally help him through play and the things we have. Me looking for a piano/keyboard/music toy does not then mean i am forcing music upon my child.
Not expecting anything from a 10 month old. Just put this in as a reference point as, if it's something he can get enjoyment from now too, that's a bonus.

My comment asking people not to veer off track was purely because my GOD it happens so much. People just love a bloody good moan and to be critical.

140,Don’t know how to parent anymore,"I’m 38, have been married for 15 years. Have twin girls who are 11. I feel like I’m incapable of parenting one of my twins anymore. She has very little emotional regulation, grunts or yells or something along those lines when she’s frustrated. She has a breakdown whenever I ask her to do a chore, (sweeping under the table was today’s culprit). She literally sat on the floor to sweep 🤔 if I tell her gently it doesn’t work, I have to lose my self for her to pay attention to what I’m asking. She has no phone and no social media so I know it’s not that. She’s extremely happy to be out and about with me doing things (preferably that she likes). But when I ask her for something at home - like help contributing to the family - she loses it. She’s super sensitive, names her stuffed animals and treats them like family :-) she has no issue communicating with people, has many friends and is an A student. She’s in a gifted program at her school and in advanced level math. So she’s doing well in some areas but has a meltdown over her little brothers behavior and over asking her to clean her room! Unless of course we’re outside having ice cream and watching her favorite movie then she’s all good. 
I’m at my wits end! I feel like she just doesn’t pay attention to what I need her to do (and it’s not a lot) until I start yelling. I feel like I have lost my maternal authority somehow. I have talked to her about emotional regulation, given her tips, bought her books and workbooks that are age appropriate for her to learn about her feelings and identify them etc… 
Her sister helps out and there are no big issues -  but the other twins behavior is really affecting the family. 
I’m going to take her to a counselor soon. I just don’t know what I’ll say? She doesn’t listen? She doesn’t pickup? It seems so petty - isn’t every 11 year old like that? but I’ve reached a point that I’m afraid to ask her for help because I don’t want a negotiation, nagging, whining, meltdown. She showers once a week and that’s if I push her to do it. She doesn’t care her hair is oily - hygiene is just not a priority for her. I’ve asked her to make a schedule, a chart etc… ti help her accomplish things. She’s excited about writing it down and planning it. After a couple of weeks everything’s forgotten and wrote back to 0. She’s 11.5 - I would really like to know how to parent her.

141,My 3 yo son has been awful at bedtime these last few nights :(,"We’ve had a good bedtime routine for awhile now. Even if he calls me back into his room and I talk to him a little, that’s fine. He’s called me back multiple times before he falls asleep and I’m okay with that too. 

I’ve recently gave birth to another little boy (8 weeks @ this point) and my 3 year old has needed a little extra attention at bedtime but nothing like what these past few nights have been. It’s been a serious digression behavior wise. 

He’ll get in bed, I’ll sit and talk with him for a little bit but then something will switch in him. He wants to get up and nothing can get him to lay back down. He takes nothing I say seriously. I’ve been nice. I’ve been stern. I’ve regrettably cried (twice). He will not stay in his room, let alone his bed. I really don’t know what to do and I know I haven’t been doing the right things.

I’ve taken toys away. I’ve threatened Christmas gifts away. Called Santa. He does not take me seriously. He didn’t care about his toys or literally anything. I know the punishment should fit the crime. And I’m not saying it’s a “crime” really. It’s just that bedtime has always been relatively easy for us and I feel like this is so out of character for my son. 

Can someone please give me some advice? This isn’t the parent i want to be. And maybe I’ve just been extra on edge because of the addition.

144,My partner's 8 year old child can't sleep without an adult present.,"Sorry if this is too long or confusing, English is not my first language. 

My (30F) boyfriend (46M) has two boys from his previous marriage, ages 10 and 8. They spend a week with us, and a week with his ex-wife.

The kids share the same room. The older one sleeps like a baby, while the younger one needs me or his dad to accompany him every single night, and would wail/cry whenever bf takes a firm stance and refuses, which results in dad coming over anyway. Sometimes he knocks on our door at odd hours (1AM, 3AM, you get it). Bf tries his best to not have me do it because he assures that it's his responsibility, but I help out sometimes.

My bf has been sick for a few days and couldn't move, and tried to explain to the younger child (let's call him Sam) that he's not well and can't be around him too much to lower the risk of spreading, plus he could barely move.

Last night he firmly set his boundary with Sam before heading to bed, telling him that he can't expect to be accompanied every night and told him to go to bed. At 2AM, Sam starts wailing, bf goes over, and comes back to me after he's asleep, but alas Sam comes knocking again after 30 minutes. Unfortunately due to his unwell state, he raised his voice at his son and told him off, and Sam went to bed quietly crying. 

I voiced my frustration at my bf, telling him that we need to find a way to deal with this, and coddling nor yelling at him was not the way. My bf started crying, saying that one of the reasons his marriage failed was because him and his ex-wife could not sleep together since Sam was born, and that put a strain. 

I went back to Sam after reading some articles at 2AM+ in the morning, found him silently crying as well. I told him straight up that sleeping alone can be scary, and he will be scared, but we need to work together so he can train himself to sleep. I know he's sad to see his dad sad as well. I told him I'll be back in one minute to check on him but will not lay in bed with him, and pinky promised.

The other parent decided to get involved directly with my son without trying to contact me first and text him that she would be showing up at my house everyday until she can find me.

148,Baby yells and won't stay asleep,"My bub is 5mo, and over the last couple of months we've developed what I think is a really sweet bedtime routine. When it's time for bed, I give him a quick bath, put lotion and jammies on him, and rock him to sleep while giving him a bedtime bottle. I also sing to him while he has his bottle. It absolutely warms my heart every night and is the happiest I've been as a mother.

Lately, however, he has developed a really annoying new habit at bedtime that I'm not sure how to handle. Bub will fall asleep in my arms after his bottle, is completely passed out, and when I put him down he immediately wakes and starts rolling around and yelling....not crying or fussing, just yelling/babbling very loudly. 

It's made it so we have to try twice every night (at least) to get him back to sleep. My husband and I do not want to sleep train through the CIO method, but he's not crying per se. Is it ok to leave him to yell himself to sleep? I don't want to give up my bedtime cuddle routine because I know he won't let me do this forever, and it has seriously been the most content I've been since being a mom. It absolutely melts my heart every night and I look forward to it.

149,Am I crazy for wanting no toys in the living room?,"My kids are 4 and 7. They have plenty of toys in their rooms and tons in the basement. Now my husband works from home in the basement, no separate room with a door so admittedly they can't go down there during work hours. But I work 3-4 days a week too so most days they're not home during work hours. When I do have a weekday off my 7 year old only has a half hour between getting home from school before my husband finishes work, and he usually plays a bit on the switch when he first gets home.

My four year old is in half day preschool 3 days a week and most of my weekdays off match up to those days. So say I let her watch as little tv then we get groceries and have lunch before preschool, there isn't much time to get bored of the top two floors.

My husband thinks I'm crazy for not wanting to store toys in the living room. He doesn't even think we should get a coffee table because they won't have space to play. He thinks they deserve to have toys throughout the house because it's a family home. I don't even mean they can't play in the living room but when they're done the toys just don't belong there. 

His only argument that makes sense (to me) is that the basement and kids rooms are both so full already there wouldn't be space for the stuff currently kept in the living room. Which is true. Of course that's another issue, he's much more sentimental about what to keep them I am so we have so many things they hardly play with but because they have pulled them out once or twice in the last six months, or if they're a particularly sentimental gift, we have to keep them.

But am I a terrible parent for not wanting the entire home so kid- centric?",z1elrs,327,363,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z1elrs/am_i_crazy_for_wanting_no_toys_in_the_living_room/,parenting
150,potty training help 😩,"I don't know what else to do. My daughter is 4 and a half and we've basically been potty training for 2 years. I waited until she was ready because in the beginning it was just constant accidents. She has a slight speech delay so it also helped to wait for her to be able to communicate better when she has to go.

She wears underwear during the day at home and often will have a small accident in them before she realizes and runs to the bathroom. However luckily she always poops in the potty whether she is wearing underwear or a pull-up. At night and when we go out she wears a pull-up because she will not tell you if she has to go and will just pee her pants. We've tried small trips like a walk to the the park and she'll just pee her pants without saying anything. A lot of times too at home if she's watching TV or playing video games she will pee without realizing she did it.",z2dwdf,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z2dwdf/potty_training_help/,parenting

152,When is a threat something that should be brought to the attention of school...etc,"  

My daughter (10) is struggling with friends. She had good friend last year and they added a third (new to the school) at the end of the year. The girls got along great at first but now the newer girl has become toxic. She has accused my daughter of hurting her physically and said that her parents say she cannot play with my daughter anymore. The other girl (a follower) has stated the same thing to my daughter about her parents, when I know for a fact that her parents have said no such thing (her mom would contact me if there was an issue, and she invited my daughter over not 2 days later). There have been many other instances of them being inappropriate, rude, mean, dismissive, (not how friends should treat each other) etc. I have been attempting to counsel my daughter to maintain distance from them, they have had conversations with the school social worker and the principal about friendship and how they should be treating each other. I have called the teacher, principal and social worker to make sure my daughter isn’t doing something she shouldn’t (i.e. hurting any one verbally or physically) and they say they have no knowledge of this nor have any children complained about her. My daughter is a horrible liar and she confesses everything to me, we have a very open relationship. I have been hesitant to bring the other parents in to this situation as the other two girls know that my daughter tells me everything and they will know if their parents find out it will be because I told on them and they will treat her worse. 

Now my daughter is coming home saying that the one is threatening to kick her ass if she tells me stuff. And today she said they have a list of people they don’t like and want to kill. These girls are 10 and 11 years old. We are considering changing school for my daughter as she is entering middle school next year and will likely be moving to this new school (k-8) anyway. 

But my dilemma is this… at what point should these threats from 10/11 year-olds be taken seriously? I don’t think they have any intention of doing anything but is this the beginning of really bad stuff? I know the one girl (first friend) is in therapy (same as my kids, I made the recommendation). Her parents are overwhelmed with siblings and their own parents who are failing, and I believe they aren’t seeing the signs. New kids mom has a new born and dad got a promotion at work. I know if I go to the school it will blow up, my kid will likely be retaliated against.",z26c2v,5,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z26c2v/when_is_a_threat_something_that_should_be_brought/,parenting
153,I’m finding parenting and fostering a difficult and overwhelming transition,"** trigger warning**  I feel like I need to be happy & smiling for the kids but god it’s so hard. I paste on the smile all day and pretend it’s all ok. 

I began the foster process for my niece (13) in May, there has been a lot of delays. It wasn’t in my life plan but it was the last step before she’d go to a care home. I’ve never let her go, I’ve known her since birth. I love her.  She arrived a very mixed up and upset child but I feel like she’s made good progress. 

My 16 yr old niece still lives with her dad, though he is never around. Comes back maybe once a week. She recently attempted suicide and as she listed me as her next of kin, I spent a week in hospital with her. The social have asked I visit/contact her once a day to ensure she’s ok. I need to look after her medication an make sure she doesn’t try to OD. The social have asked I invite her for tea 2 or 3 times a week as she’s developed an eating disorder. 

I’m trying to coordinate their doctor’s appointments, dentists, opticians, hearing etc etc. I’m attending the meetings with social for both of them. 

I’ve brought the 16 yr old lots of presents for Christmas so she’s not left out, I want her to spend Christmas with us but I’m not sure she will.. she’s also coming on holiday with us in feb, she joins us on days out etc. 

I get financial support for the younger one which really helps. My toddler is amazing, he’s coping with all of the changes well & has started nursery full time to account for me starting university. 

I’m struggling at uni, with all the appointments, the recent admission to hospital, plus general sickness of the kids I’ve had time off I feel guilty for. How on earth do other single parents balance this all? My flat is tiny, the 13 yr old sleeps on my sofa. Sometimes it feels so crammed, I wish I could do better, that this all came naturally to me. I’m trying so hard to protect them and give them all happy lives.

*EDIT.. 

I’d like to thank you all for your replies, I’ve reread them many times for a pick me up 🙏 and I’ll read them again on my down days. I’ll speak to social services about how I’m stretching myself thin and that if they could perhaps take the kids to some of the appointments so I can still attend university more often. I’ve worked hard to get to uni so I really don’t want to defer, it would be a last resort. 

I’ll also look into groups/activities or hobbies for the older one. The 13 yr old isn’t keen on the local activities offered but we make time to do ‘murder mystery boxes’ we order online- it follows a storyline etc etc, she loves it 😂 hopefully I can find something to do with the 16 yr old that I can give her my whole attention too. 

It was mentioned about the 16 yr old living with me, honesty I would love her to stay here. Her current accommodation is horrific, she suffers in neglect. No carpets, windows smashed, 2 garden chairs instead of sofas. The dog was hungry & unfed (my niece didn’t have the money to feed him) the list could go on. When I saw it my heart wrenched. I couldn’t believe how bad it was. I almost cried next to the ambulance crew. But the social services can’t be ‘seen to supporting her living in an accommodation they want her to move out of’ or something like that. Unfortunately the 16 yr old says the house is too busy, she needs space & I get that.. I wish I could change her mind though. She’s a stubborn one! X 

But again, thank you so much for your responses, thank you for not judging me, I really am trying.",z1wc8z,15,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z1wc8z/im_finding_parenting_and_fostering_a_difficult/,parenting
154,Why do people ask if a newborn sleeping through the night?,"Firstly I’m not sure if this is an international thing or just where I am. 

Since having my first baby (now 4 weeks old) people constantly ask if she’s sleeping through the night. She isn’t she wakes up every 3-4 hours for a feed (Formula fed) which our GP has advised is perfectly normal and if she sleeps beyond the 4 hours to wake her for a feed. 

Once we answer telling them she’s not sleeping through the night they inevitably say that their children were 1/2 weeks and they were sleeping through the night. I’ve mentioned to one or two people that our GP advised waking her and they mention ‘never wake a sleeping baby’ she’ll never sleep through the night if we wake her. 

We haven’t woken her, but that’s purely because we don’t have to she wakes every 4 hours herself. If she does though I’d wake her, because that’s what we’ve been told to do by our doctor. She’s only 4 weeks so I’m pretty sure she needs the nutrition. 

It almost comes across in a bragging way? They’ll say things like ‘Our Eva was great at seeping, after the first week she’d sleep for 8/9 hours at night’ or ‘We never had that issue with Tom’ 

Am I being a silly here and there some unspoken rule that everyone lets their baby sleep though the night and just doesn’t admit it?

155,4 yr old is determined to ride in the cart,"For whatever reason, my 4 yr old hates to walk anywhere. He asks to use the stroller on walks, and he wants to ride in the cart at the store.

Today we went to the store and I decided he was going to walk this time because he’s quite old enough and his younger brother has to sit in the child seat. I need room in the cart for buying the stuff. This did not go over well.

156,School truancy,"So today I got the letter in the mail that tells me our 6 year old is getting close to the district limit of absences. She has been genuinely sick multiple times this year, including RSV which she is still coughing from now at the 6 week mark, and a sinus infection. She missed 5 or 6 days for that alone, where she had repeated fevers of 103°F, was vomiting up mucus and sleeping all day. 

She's finished her antibiotics for the sinus infection, was right as rain for a week, then yesterday she complained of a headache and her temp shot up to 102.6°F. At 6 this morning she was still running a fever and she was on a rotation of Tylenol and Motrin. She is feeling better now, and we plan on sending her to school in the morning, but how should I respond to the vice principal who sent the letter?

They had to send her home a day even, as she started vomiting and had a fever of 101. The only day she missed that she wasn't sick was when we took her for an evaluation for a medical diagnosis of autism. I mean, do they really want me to just dose her with Tylenol and send her to school when her temp is 103? They'll just send her back home because she'll be sleepy and whiny and upset to crying, which makes her head hurt more. 

I guess what I'm asking is, how do I go about a conversation with the school without telling them they're being ridiculous, as I just can't make her magically not get sick, and without cussing them out and calling them names? I'm so annoyed with them right now. She loves school, we hate when we have to keep her home, and as soon as she's up and feeling better we have workbooks at home for her that are a grade level ahead.

157,AITA for not wanting toddler and infant to sleep in same room?,"We have a toddler and a newborn baby. The toddler sleeps in the nursery still and our baby has been (attempting) to sleep in the bassinet in our bedroom. The nursery is basically right next to our bedroom. I really want the toddler moved out of the nursery so our newborn won’t wake her up in the middle of the night and ruin her sleep schedule- for the last few nights I’ve slept on the couch or tried to because our toddler shouldn’t have to be woken up every few hours. At first, my husband said he would do it before our newborn was born. Well it’s still not done and right before our newborn was born, he said we still have time and he isn’t getting our toddler’s room set up for a few weeks at least. I’m losing my patience because I’ve been sleeping on the couch- when I do try to have our newborn sleep in the bassinet he has been waking up our toddler at least once a night. I can’t do it. I’d rather sleep on the couch than risk our toddler not getting enough sleep or her not being able to go back to sleep. So my husband is now pissed because I’m sleeping on the couch- he wants me to sleep in our bed (no duh, I want that too) but I feel bad if our baby wakes up our toddler. Our toddler has adapted extremely well to our newborn and I don’t want her to be cranky during the day because of lack of sleep. I’m about to just work on her room myself because I don’t want a week old baby and toddler in the same room.

I told him beforehand that this wasn’t going to be a good idea. He thinks I haven’t given it a chance. The first night wasn’t too bad with them together but our baby still woke her up.

165,3 year old having issues with daycare,"My son has been in daycare a couple days a week since he was nine months old and has now increased to 4 days a week now that he’s 3. Around four months ago we moved house and he now attends a new daycare which he has seemed super happy at, barely upset when I drop him off and always happy playing when I pick him up. I’d always ask the teachers how his day was also and they’d say he had a great day.

My issues arose a few weeks ago when I randomly got a call from one of the daycare teachers wanting to let me know about my sons ‘not nice daycare behaviour’. She wasn’t asking for me to collect him but just said it was the worst day she’s had with him and also hinting that he’s often naughty. Her issues were that he talks back and doesn’t listen to them when they try to get him to do things or redirect him from doing something he shouldn’t be, he doesn’t share, and the biggest issue is that he is very hard to get to sleep/ rest and requires them to sit with him for sometimes up to an hour. 

Now I understand the sleep issue as he has always been a terrible sleeper, he slept only a few hours at a time for so long. Always woke up in the night requiring breast milk and comfort to go back to sleep and every day nap, he had to be breastfeed and rocked to sleep. The car or pram walks always puts him to sleep so I started planning my days so I could be driving during his nap time and would take him for a walk or drive at bed time. Not the greatest I know, but it meant I could get sleep and have some time to myself. Now that he’s older I still drive him around nap time but at night time he will often fall asleep in the bed with me and his dad and he’s happy to just go to sleep, although it can be as late as 9.30 which is too late for a toddler. He then sleeps in until 7 which is why I think he might be hard to get to sleep at daycare as he’s not tired enough at 12 when they start nap time. I know this is an issue and I’ve ordered melatonin to try help him go to bed earlier at night and perhaps be more ready for a sleep at 12.

I’m hoping that the melatonin might magically fix the problem but I’m still a bit uncomfortable with it all. She was saying things like ‘he has his sweet moments’ but it sounded like she was implying he’s not a good kid when at home, besides the sleeping, he’s a real sweet heart and listens and shares with his friends/ cousins during play dates. It also just sounded like typical 3 year old behaviour. He just wants to play and do his own thing not be told what to do. I also had issues because it was the first of heard of it and the person telling me was only 21 so even tho I’m sure she’s very well trained it’s hard to take advice from someone a lot younger as I can’t imagine she’s had too many years of experience. We also have him looked after by both his grandparents often and they say how good he is. I know he gets spoilt tho so I’m sure some of this stems from him being spoilt at home/ with others but as he’s our only child and is happy with us we don’t have to tell him no often. 

Has anyone had experience with trying to get 3 year old into a good nap/ bed time routine? I’ve thought about getting him a sleep comfort toy that he can only have at nap time but not sure if that might be distracting. I just feel guilty as I keep asking her how he is when I pick him up although she sometimes says he’s been fine I can just tell he’s hard work for her and it hurts my heart for him.",z26z1s,3,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z26z1s/3_year_old_having_issues_with_daycare/,parenting

170,The Best Sleeping Practices for Your Baby,"Ensuring that your baby gets enough sleep is crucial for their development. That may seem like a lot, but there are a number of factors that can contribute to disruptions in your baby’s sleep. Below are some of the best practices for helping your baby get the rest they need.

It’s no secret that getting a good night’s sleep is crucial for both baby and parent. But with all the advice out there, it can be hard to know where to start when it comes to developing healthy sleeping practices for your little one. Read on for 5 top tips to ensure that your baby (and you!) get the best possible sleep.

**1. Establish a bedtime routine and stick to it.** A bedtime routine is crucial in helping your baby wind down and prepare for sleep. Try keeping things simple at first, with a bath followed by some quiet playtime before heading off to bed.

**2. Put your baby down drowsy but awake.** It may seem counter-intuitive, but putting your baby down when they’re already asleep is actually not ideal. This is because babies need to learn how to fall asleep on their own, and if they’re used to being rocked or fed to sleep, they may have difficulty doing this later on.

**3.Don’t let your baby ‘cry it out’.** There’s no need to let your baby cry themselves to sleep – this can actually do more harm than good by causing unnecessary distress. If your little one is having trouble settling down, try going in at regular intervals (every 5-10 minutes or so) to check on them and offer reassurance until they drift off peacefully.

**Finally…** don’t forget about yourself! Getting enough rest can be difficult when you have a young baby, but it’s important not to ignore your own needs in favor of caring for your child around the clock.",z2qe6z,0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z2qe6z/the_best_sleeping_practices_for_your_baby/,parenting
171,Why is my 3 y/o acting constipated if he isn't?,"My 3y/o has been complaining his tummy and butt hurts, consistently saying he has to poop but when we go to the bathroom, he just sits there and cries saying it hurts. He kind of bounces on the seat like he's having a tantrum, and tries to dig at his butt. A few nights ago I took him to the ER and they did xrays and said he wasn't consitpated. Basically told me he was fine. He has pooped a couple times but he's been doing this for days now. He is waking in the middle of the night saying he has to go but then doesn't and just cries saying it hurts. I'm at my wits end. Part of me feels like it may be for attention but I don't think he is faking being in pain? Is a 3 y/o capable of that? Any advice?

While I love my 1yr little one and have the most amazing moments, It's been extremely challenging adapting to the new lifestyle and being responsible 24/7. Wife works 60 hours minimum per week and I work a normal 40 so I end up doing a lot of house chores and administrative stuff. She's been at her job for 9 months like this after our little one was born and I honestly feel burnt out. Her argument which I agree with is that This is a difficult phase and will get easier once the kids grow up. But I just want to be the best parent I can but it's hard when I'm tired all the time and feeling like I'm doing a good bit more than 50%. I feel like this is how negligence can start and I never want to be that parent who's just passive in the kids life. I've had this very open conversation with my wife and she appreciates all that I do. But she still insists We should have more kids and soon.

179,Giving a middle schooler advice on bullies,"I'm not the parent in this situation but not sure where else to post. I (25F) have a little brother (12M) who's being bullied by one of his classmates. Even though we have a big age gap I'm very close with him and I talk with Jim on the phone almost daily. Middle schoolers can just be the worst, specially to thier peers. 

His bully constantly makes fun of him, from the clothes he wears, the way he walks, his weight etc. My (not so little) brother is a gentle giant and a little on the flamboyant side. One day on the family group call my brother came home crying cause his bully was making fun of him being ""gay."" I was fuming. 

My Mom contacted the school about it and the counselor decided ""well we don't want to single anyone out."" So instead of having this kid come to the office to talk about harassing my brother she instead went to his class to generally talk about the effects of bullying. Ofcourse that didn't help anything so my brother just tries to stay out of this kids way. 

Well recently my brother and his bully got grouped together for a project, my brother is the top of his class in terms of academics so he immediately got voted in as group leader. This morning he sent me a screenshot from his bully. Calling him names, slurs and insulting his intelligence all because of a misunderstanding for the project. 

My Mom just tells him to not pay the kid any mind and just ignore him, she's very patient and unconfrontational. But I guess I don't yet have parent insight like that. I'm running on sibling energy so I told him to punch the kid in the face, square on the nose. Not to worry about getting in trouble cause hes got paper trials of this kid bullying anyway. 

Highly doubt he'd actually do it but atleast I made him smile. He goes to a small private school and my parents don't want me going behind thier back and making it a bigger deal. I know in the long run it's something that won't matter to much, but I just want to defend my little brother the same way our older brother defended me when we were in school. Him chasing my bully around the play ground to tell him not to mess with me is a core memory of mine. 

Kids will be mean to each other no matter what generation I guess. Just wish school would have better policies about it.

EDIT: btw the kids mom is a single.mom who's a teacher at thier school. So I'm sure her working there has something to do with thier lack of action.",z23jm4,3,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z23jm4/giving_a_middle_schooler_advice_on_bullies/,parenting
180,4 year old won’t participate,"I found some older posts about this but wanted to ask about my situation. I have a 4 y/o son who is very slow to warm up. He’s in daycare full time (that’ll be another post) and I started him in classes at our ymca to try to get him involved in activities. He is in his second class now. In both classes, the first session he rushed right out and participated for the most part. He did 7 weeks of an “intro to sports” class and after the first class it would take about 20 minutes for him to join in each week. Now we are doing gymnastics and he just sits there with a sad face during stretching and warm ups, and then walks with his head down, a sad face, hands in pockets after that. Sometimes he just stands there, and I feel awful because that’s bringing way more attention to a child who doesn’t want attention. If I let him sit with me, he giggles and acts silly and fools around, but won’t walk 10 feet away to participate in the activities which he says he wants to do and loves! I figured something non-competitive would be a better fit for his personality. 

I know I shouldn’t force him but it’s very triggering for me when he refuses to participate. I was shy and didn’t participate and sometimes I wish someone would’ve worked with me to make me feel comfortable. It made me sad to not “be able to” participate. I know I’m projecting …

181,Can we normalize asking babies genders before assuming?,"I know it shouldn't bother me, but it does. My daughter is about 16 months old and is constantly misgendered, even when she's wearing a bunch of pink and bows. I understand that people want to be open and gender neutralized and such and I have absolutely no problem with that, if that is THEIR choice. But my daughter gets called a boy often and it drives me crazy. During a 20 minute grocery store trip today she got called a boy THREE times. She doesn't have much hair yet and maybe that's why they just assume, but she can have a shirt on that literally says ""little sister"" and people still call her a boy. She doesn't like bows on her head and I just don't feel like it's worth it to pierce her ears this young. I look at her and just think she's to dang pretty to be a boy, but it happens almost every time we leave the house. 

Ok..rant over. I'm just really butthurt over this.

Edit: some.. ok MOST of you guys seemed to take this in a way it was not intended for. I, personally, get annoyed when my daughter is called a boy because my efforts of dressing her in more of a feminine outfit are completely ignored. It's more of a feminine or masculin issue, not about genitals. Genitalia wasn't even on my mind when I thought about this and I find it kinda disgusting that yall went straight to that. Smh... like yall think I really just want her fuckin coochie out there for the world to know about. GiRlS hAvE vAgInAs AnD bOyS hAvE pEnIsEs. Obviously, we already know that. All I wanted to do was come here to vent because my efforts of putting cute GIRL outfits together are shrugged off and people frequently call her a boy because or her lack or hair. YOU may not give two shits, but I do. I also got hate for even bringing up the pierced ear thing but I stated that I DONT think it's worth.

186,How to set boundaries with parents who think they could raise my baby better than me?,"My parents adore my 10m son, after losing my first born in a still birth 3 years ago he feels even more precious to us, and by us I mean the wider family, not just my partner and I.

So, it's felt particularly difficult to set what I feel are reasonable boundaries when it comes to the baby and things have gotten so bad that I'm starting to feel as though they resent me for being his mother,  because they think they'd do a better job of raising him. 

Don't get me wrong,  I am a 32F, married with a stepchild that I've also raised from the age of 3. We have our own house on quiet little close full of young families,  and we prayed hard for this baby,  there is nothing we wouldn't do or provide for him. 

However, my parents criticise me as if I were a bad babysitter, not my babys mother.  

Nothing I do is good enough.  The food I cook and prepare fresh isn't good enough,  I don't take him for long enough walks, I mustn't have a very good bed time routine as he still wakes in the night, the house is too messy, or when it's tidy I'm not spending enough time playing with him. I need to move into a bigger house but it's ridiculous to think I can go back to work full time to pay for it. If I have errands to run I spend too much time out of the house with him - and 'did you make sure he ate??!!' Urmmm... yes, I fed my child! In what world?!

I don't know if it's anxiety driven or motivated by an absolute lack of trust in me, but the final nail in the coffin came over the weekend when I found out my dad had let himself into the house while my husband and I were on our honeymoon and snooped around the entire house and reported back to my mum that it was a tip and he was worried for my sons future. I'm beyond livid. I really think they've lost all sense of what is appropriate for one,  and what it's like to have a baby in the house for two.

For context, the week leading upto this my (now) husband was still in work full time while I took care of the baby,  kept the house running, finalised wedding arrangements AND jumped through hoop after hoop for the new job I've had to find since being made redundant on maternity leave. So yes, for the first time in my adult life I left for a holiday without mopping the floor or making the bed.  The bins were emptied, the pots were washed but my goal that day was to make sure my baby had everything he needed packed for a week away from the house, and after that, that the rest of our wedding attire, wedding venue decor, favours  and a few honeymoon bits were packed. It was a crazy day! 


But hubby and I specifically booked our honeymoon a day shorter than planned so that we'd have time to get the house straight and tidy before the baby returned from my parents (they had been planning to have him while we honeymooned long before I even gave birth,  it wasn't even a conversation). But before they brought him home the following day I had texts from my mum telling me we should be ashamed of ourselves and that we were putting our baby at risk. 

Note, my mum has been a bit of a catastrophiser for as long as I can remember. Everything goes from 0 to worst case scenario with her, that's even a running joke, we (herself included) call her Aunt Josephine, the aunt from Lemony Snickets Series Of Unfortunate Events. 

But this took the cake! How dare they! They entered my home,  our safe space, without permission, snooped around,  upstairs downstairs in the fridge, the bathrooms... and after the busiest bloody week of my life thought it okay to weaponise my child and the grief we hold onto every single day for our lost baby. And for what? An untidy house? 

They have criticised every single aspect of my life, and it's been happening for 20 years but this feels different, I think because now I know what it means to be a parent and to want nothing but happiness for your little one, but also because I know, I KNOW, I'm a good mum! My baby is always happy, always smiling and safe and loves his little family.

They are good people,  but they can be so cruel.  They adore my son, but it's clear to me I need to set boundaries. I just don't know how to do it without causing a lasting rift in the family.  Despite the sometimes daily hurt, they're my parents and i obviously want them in my life and my sons.

187,Parents with Anxiety: would you do it again?,"Hi all - My husband and I are both unsure about having kids and talk about it probably once a month. We see both sides - one on hand, I would love to experience and understand the love for a child and share life with them, but on the other hand we know having a kid would change our very independent lives and the kid is going to be their own person (which could easily be a source of stress, worry, frustration, etc.)

I know there will be people with opinions on both sides of this. What I’m more so looking for are perspectives and opinions from parents with anxiety. After losing my mom three years ago, unfortunately my mind decided it was going full send into anxiety and stress land. I’ve really made great strides going to therapy, communicating what I need, getting on meds at one point, etc. But I’m not back to the old, more carefree me and am not sure if I’ll ever get there again. So, this is obviously on our minds too as we think about kids, both for their sake and ours. I’m not sure if this makes me more susceptible to postpartum depression, but we wonder how a baby will affect my mindset and mental health.

190,Normal Terrible Twos or Something Worse? This Can't Be Normal Behavior,"For the past two months, give or take, my 2.5 year old daughter has had these epic meltdowns. They stem from little to nothing, like fussing her for something she knows she shouldn't be doing. 

These meltdowns last for anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes generally, involve a lot of screaming, hitting, kicking, head banging off the wall, and she's started trying to bite walls and tables. 

Tonight she had a meltdown, hit herself a lot and hit her head off the wall where she bit her lip, and then bit my arm hard when I tried to calm her down. I've got a nice imprint of teeth on my wrist, and punched me across the face multiple times. 

I tried calming her down, telling her I love you and want to help you feel better. She kept repeating, ""I don't love you daddy,"" while hitting herself. I broke down crying, and it was like a switch flipped. She stopped her meltdown, gave me a hug, and started to play.

We spoke to her pediatrician, and according to him, so long as she doesn't break skin or draw blood, he's not overly concerned. That toddlers at this age have meltdowns and it's normal.

193,How to discipline in a new way?,"My mom spanked me. It wasnt a frenzied beating, it was dispassionate and measured, a wooden spoon on the butt. I know she was doing the best she could but I don't want to spank my kids. I try to do as much gentle parenting and attachment parenting as I can. 

I have 6yo twins (b/g). The girl is much bigger than her brother. Recently she seems to have hit a new developmental stage and I don't know if she's testing me or if it's hormones but she seems to have random periods of rage. Anything can send her into sulks and resentment, sometimes screaming and throwing stuff around. My usual tactic is, your feelings are valid but you aren't allowed to hurt people or things. I offer her to jump on the trampoline, hit the punching bag, time alone, etc.

This evening I told her to change out of school clothes and I to playclothes. She got mad. Her brother said something teasing as they changed and she grabbed him by the back of the neck and slammed his face into the wall. 

They often roughhouse in fun, and sometimes they hurt eachother on accident. I don't punish them for rough house accidents. But this was deliberate hurting. I know my mom would have given me 5 whacks with the spoon for this. I don't want to hit my daughter.

194,34 month old deliberating peeing the bed,"My nearly 3 year old son is fully potty trained in day. He is in a toddler bed and was doing great at getting up and using the little potty in his room during the night 

These last few weeks he has regressed and has been peeing the bed multiple times a night. On purpose 

So we tried pull-ups to save us from changing sheets 3 times a night, and thinking maybe he wasn’t quite developmentally ready to wake up every time. Only for us to discover he is pulling them down to deliberately pee in the bed (like I’ve literally witnessed it in his baby monitor)  

When I go in to change the sheets he’s proud of what he’s done. I don’t know how to not give it the attention he obviously wants without leaving him to sleep in a wet bed.

195,RSV 12 Days Old,"Well it happened.  Brought our new baby home and our two older children started with a cough.  Of course we kept the baby away from the other kids, but at that point he had already been exposed.  He started with a congested cough and was diagnosed with RSV the following day.  On day 5 (15 days old) we were admitted to the hospital where we stayed for 5 days on oxygen.  Thankfully we are home and he is much better.  Day 4,5 and 6 are the worst days of the illness and when you are likely to experience respiratory distress.  I wanted to share a great YouTube video that educated me on the signs of breathing issues with infants, since they don’t always show the same symptoms as kids or adults.  It’s very scary for parents bc going to the ER exposes them to other illnesses and sometimes RSV can be managed at home.[Recognizing Respiratory Distress"" by Monica Kleinman, MD for OPENPediatrics](https://youtu.be/Fmt6JB-W_M8)",z1flro,61,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z1flro/rsv_12_days_old/,parenting
196,How often do you see YOUR friends (with/without kids)?,"I’m curious how well and frequently people integrate their close friends into their family lives as socializing is becoming a normal thing again. 

A little backstory: currently living in my husband’s home city/burbs, about four hours away from mine. I’d love to move closer to “my home” to raise our kids (currently 4 and 2 and 3mo). There are various factors why and why not that I won’t go into here, but a chunk of it is I’d like to be closer to my close friends, several of whom have kids close in age to ours. I’m an only child, so these people are more like siblings/cousins to me. I have kept in regular contact with them and visited lots before Covid (which unfortunately preceded kids 2 and 3). My husband says “you can’t go back to the way things were,” but I don’t think that’s what I want. I want play dates, zoo/museum days, adult and kid birthday parties, and the occasional grownup hang. 

It’s a large and expensive metro area, so if we moved back there we might be an hour away from some of my close friends, but at least we wouldn’t have to stay overnight to see them. But realistically, how often do busy parents get to do nice stuff with the people they love outside the immediate family?",z1ysxs,3,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z1ysxs/how_often_do_you_see_your_friends_withwithout_kids/,parenting

198,Anybody else have multiple kids that only refer to eachother by their pronouns?,"I have 2 daughter's (6,7) who I have literally ONLY heard acknowledge eachother by their pronouns, when talking directly to eachother. It's the weirdest thing to me because I've never heard of it from any other siblings lol.

&#x200B;

Like they'll go ""Sister, where are you?"" ""Sister, daddy said dinner is ready"", ""Sister, why did we learn that the Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell in middle school, considering it has never been needed to know outside of mentioning that we never needed to know that?"". Like if they're playing with stuffed animals and doing the voices and pretending one of the toys is talking to their sister, only THEN will they refer to eachother by name.

&#x200B;

So a few weeks ago I just asked ""Why do y'all only ever call eachother sister?"" In tandem, they went ""Cause she's my sister"", (Which was creepy as fuck, btw. It was like those affluent kid villains on Kids Next Door). I went ""If y'all had a brother, would y'all call him brother?"" They went ""No, that's weird"".

200,I’m unintentionally giving up on my 3 year old twins?,"Try not to judge me, I’m at my wits end. 
I’m a single parent to twin autistic girls (also non verbal) who’ll be 4 in jan and a 3 month old baby boy. I’m still living at home with all 4 of us in the one bedroom. 
I have applied/seeked for help every way I can, I’m still waiting for their official diagnosis (it’s inevitable) but like with everything there’s a massive waiting list. I have tried in every way for them to have a relatively regular childhood (soft play, park, swimming) but Everytime I try it blows up in my face. They explore everything by mouth, I once had to dig dog poop out of twin 1s mouth, she’s also tried to eat cigarette butts found on the floor of the park. They are constantly making noises. Screaming, grunting, shouting and squealing. Like regular toddlers they can’t stand the word ‘no’ but they don’t throw a tantrum it basically ruins their day and they could have a good 30 mins to an hour screaming and crying. They don’t play with toys, they just hold and collect things. I’ve tried to teach them how to play with things correctly, building blocks, leapfrog books, toys with sorting shapes, they have never been interested. Ever since they were small babies they cry when they wake up from naps, it doesn’t matter what kind of nap they have they will cry their eyes out, this also goes on for 30 mins to an hour. They are constantly moaning and groaning and I can never figure out why as they can’t communicate their needs. 
I have started to realise in the last few weeks that I have almost given up on them, I literally feed and clothe them. That’s it. Whereas before I would work with them daily at teaching them basic things and working on their speech and language, I never got anywhere. I used to talk to them constantly, ask them questions etc but I don’t anymore. I used to say good morning to them every morning but I got greeted with a scream or a loud moaning noise. I used to take them to the park every other day but had to stop because they wouldn’t stop eating the sand from the sandpit, when I used to stop them from eating it I was met with an almighty tantrum with would last a few hours. Everything I try seems to make their behaviour worse, if I try a new activity with them it always ends badly. I seem to have lost hope with it all. I grieve the children they should become. They deserve a mum who persists with them. I just feel burnt out and then some. Everyday is a huge challenge and most mornings I dread getting up.

This time I’m sitting in the living room with no tv on which we usually have on and when she comes down the stairs I realize I didn’t hear anything from her bathroom. I asked her “did you brush?“ and she said yes. I said “oh, I didn’t hear anything” and she said “oh yeah that’s weird” and I said “did you actually brush your teeth?” Again “YES!!!” In a more annoyed tone. I finally said “if I smell your breath is it going to be nice and minty?” And then she admitted she was lying. I asked her if this whole time she had been lying and she said no but I can’t believe her now if she can lie to my face like that. Before she lived with us, her other parents were not having her take care of her teeth and she had some very serious problems with them we had to get fixed when she came to live with us. I’m not sure if I should punish her? I’m not sure if she’s been doing it most of the time or not?

This week he can't fall asleep by himself, is getting really upset and will only fall asleep in bed with me. As soon as I put him down he cries and I just let him sleep in my bed as I know next week will probably be different.

208,Sleepover question,"Hi, I'm feeling pretty low and was looking for advice. The Dad of my son's friend texted my wife on Sunday (the 20th) at 330pm about my son having a sleepover on December 2nd. We go to a cabin on December 3rd every year, so we debated him going because we didn't want him to be exhausted, but ultimately decided it would be fine. By the time we made that decision it was late, so we figured we'd text him the next day. Since the sleepover wasn't until December 2nd we figured it would be fine. Well when my son got home from school and said his friend told him to ""remind us to text about the sleepover"", so we did. That was 530 on Monday (the 21st). The text said that it would be ok for him to come over, and we tried to ask what time we should drop him off. Still haven't had a response. 

Do you think this person could be upset? I'm just trying to understand. The sleepover is still 10 days away, and it's not like we messaged him back several days or a week later. I even apologized in the text we sent (for it being a late response), and explained about our vacation, and how we had a few things to figure out.

212,"4 year update, and advice about negative/ judgmental parents","This is a follow up to a post I made 4 years ago. https://old.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/9vlo1u/how_do_i_deal_with_my_overly_negative_parents/

I don't know what to do. Shortly after I posted the previous post, my parents showed up at my house and I was forced to talk to them. I told them all my grievances, and they said they understood and would made attempts to change things. 

Of course that did not last long. Since then (and especially since Covid/ political beliefs being emboldened), they've become more judgmental, awful than previously. I've grown up hearing the ""N"" word regularly. For a short time in my early years, I thought it was even normal. Once I was old enough to understand, I quickly changed that though. I am absolutely disgusted with it now. But now, they use that word pretty frequently, along with other slurs. My dad will use every slur in the book when same sex couples are shown in TV, and turn whatever is on off. I've told them to stop, tried educating them, but they are set in their ways. My daughter is...well, she is not straight, and not gender conforming (which she is exploring and not sure of yet, so we still use female pronouns). Of course O hadn't told them this, and I can only imagine what my parents would say to her. This is one of the reason I have cut ties again. However, most of my family believes as they do, so I am the odd one out, and treated as a bad person for this. 

Their comments about the way I chose to live (non-drinking, non-smoking, no drugs, and not meat eating) had gotten so much worse, despite me telling them how much it hurts. I am not pushy with my beliefs as they work for me, but not everyone else. One time when I had a friend over at their house to swim in their pool, and my mom made drinks for the friend since they do drink. My mom proceeded to get them plastered, and constantly told them ""they were they daughter they never had"" because they will drink with my mom. I felt...non existent. Like I was not good enough to be considered their daughter. Of course my mom thought there was nothing wrong with her comment, and laughed about it. Editing to add- I just realized this was in the original post, but it's happened more than once. 

They still never made attempts to come to our house, but would go to my other sisters all the time. They actually went to visit my aunt in South Carolina (we are in Ohio) more than they came to my house for a few years. 

During the height of Covid, they were still attending large get togethers, especially for holidays. My dad's mom died from Covid during this time. I wanted to play it safe and stayed home during some holiday get togethers, but my parents berated me for this, and told me I was being too sensitive and paranoid. Also...my dad has cancer. They were being careless and I couldn't live with myself if I had given him Covid.

The thing that made me cut ties again with them was right before Easter of last year. The Friday before Easter, I got a migraine that sent me to the ER. I had never had one like that before, and was terrified. I was given medications, and sent home. I still felt absolutely awful, and slept/ hid in a dark room. I told my mom all of this. She did not ask how I was all weekend, and when Easter came around, she texts O about how she was disappointed we were not there, and making me feel bad for staying home. She didn't even text me, just O. I was incredibly hurt that I couldn't even try to feel better at home without them using it against me. Something in me broke over this. 

There's so much I could go on and on about. All I have ever wanted was for my family to be close, and I tried so hard so do that. I can't deal with their negativity, judgment, and being treated so much worse than everyone else. The only time they have been ""proud"" of me was it came to my art- I am a fine artist, and have been getting a lot of recognition for it. My mom would share my art on her social media about how ""proud she was about my talent,"" but it felt more like she just wanted to show it off to get comments for herself. 

Last weekend, my parents got ahold of O's father (who they never talk to either), and went to his house during his weekend with her (which is farther away from them than I was) to see O. I've never not allowed them to see O. They have picked her up to hang out at their house as recently as a few weeks ago! But they acted like I was withholding her from them! 

I am viewed as the worse person in the world by my whole family. No one will talk to me because my parents have made me out to be the bad person. What should I do at this point? My heart hurts so bad, and I really do feel alone. But I do not want to be treated they way they do, and they will never stop. I loves her grandparents and I don't want to keep her from them, but I feel like no matter what I do, they use it as a way to make me seem like just the awful daughter.",z1xz46,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z1xz46/4_year_update_and_advice_about_negative/,parenting
213,Suspicious of partners mums new boyfriend (UK),"Hey all, 

I’m a bit suspicious (without any solid evidence or even what I’m suspicious about) of my partners mums new boyfriend.

Unsure if it’s just me being a new parent but something just isn’t right. The way he watches my son and interacts, something feels a bit off. He has 2 children aged around 20 who he no longer speaks to despite being local and that’s a red flag in itself for me. He says that “their mum has turned them against him” but to me, 20 year olds should be able to see through that. 

I’m concerned when my partners mum has him she may leave them alone to “quickly nip down the shops” or shower etc. My partner has tried to raise this with her mum about her concerns but it obviously falls on deaf ears.

214,i'm a horrible mama,"I grew up in chaos. I always look for chaos. I hate it, but I look for it. 
I hate that I am the way I am.

One thing I don't want my child is to grow up in the same ""home"" I was raised in. The yelling. Screaming. Things breaking. Threats. It was pure survival.

I hate that I didn't fix myself nor heal before I have a child. Now I'm regretting it the most. I thought I was okay till I become a mother.

I am unlearning a lot of bad habits and doing so are harder than i thought it was. It's like an alcoholic widthrawing from alcohol, a drug addict widhtrawing from drugs. 

I didn't even know some things that I have been doing are toxic. The behaviour I grew up on is all I know. I thought they were normal and everybody does it. Turns out I only grew up in a toxic household.

My husband,on the other hand, is the complete opposite of me. He grew up to loving parents who was able to raise and guide him the right way. I am still shocked how he says I love you Mummy and Daddy to his parents. That never happens where I grew up.

That is why he was able to point out that some of the things I do is not right. And I had no idea. And I'm thankful that he is there to guide me, to tell me how to raise kids the way he grew up on. 

But still, unlearning toxic behaviour is really difficult. I am constantly feeling like a horrible mother. My depression and depersonalization stops me from being my best self.

I am in therapy and medication. I try to read parenting books, try the best I could but I always fall short. I always feel like I am the most horrible mother there is. I constantly compare myself to other mums who are so organized and put together.

There are things that triggers me and god bless my husband for putting up with it. I always catch myself screaming and cussing out due to intense emotion. It's like I go to another world when I am having an episode and I forget my child is around me. 

Damn it. I know therapy takes a long time to work but I need it to work now. I can't take being an absolute horror of a mother to my child for long years on end. Worse, I would never ever heal and be cured. I can not put my child the same misery I have. I can not do this to my child.

Most of the times, I think it's best for me to just be gone. I know my husband is wonderful parent. But it's also selfish to leave him alone and my child. But I can't help but think they would be so so much better without me.

215,At a loss,"Hi fellow parents. I'm at a loss with my kiddo and I don't know if I need to rant or need advice or what. 

First, the obligatory I love my kid more than anything in the world statement which is 10000% true.

So my sweet 3.5 is in general a happy, great kid. He's definitely still 3 and acts that way, but for the most part he's a joy and pretty easy to parent.

Then we brought his sister home. At first, we were so pleasantly surprised - he is so affectionate and loving and just obsessed with her. He loves to play with her, help with her bottle, she's the first thing he thinks about every morning and the last thing he thinks about before he goes to sleep. 

After my husband went back to work after 6 weeks off, we had a period of adjustment and our big kid did pretty well. But now baby is 11 weeks and my toddler is just getting worse by the day. Peeing in his floor after being potty trained for a year and a half, throwing things/hitting (only his dad and me, he's not ever rough with baby), and today we had to pack up and leave after 20 minutes at a local kids area because he was throwing things. Typically when we are out and about he's an ANGEL and he saves all his wildin for home. Not today, today he chose violence. I had no idea what to do (it felt like we had literally just gotten there) so I just said, ""alright, fun's over! Time to clean and leave."" So we did.

I KNOW that this is all developmentally normal and my toddler is not the only 3.5 year old who has hurled a lego. I KNOW that this is due to the adjustment of having a new baby sister who needs mom and dad. I know these things logically but I'm giving all I've got to give and it's obviously not enough and we're all suffering.

We don't spank and we try to be very intentional with our parenting. We gentle parent, but not to the extent of permissiveness. We definitely have boundaries and hold them. We have a daily schedule/routine. We do a lot of feelings/Emotional development at home. I have worked so hard developing a secure attachment with both kids. What the fuck else can I do to help out both of my kids and get us all out of this transitional phase with our bonds intact?!

As an attendee to a party, would you do a small icebreaker or totally despise the family who did this? Is there a game everyone can play (including kids)? 

The kids have plenty of activities at our venue so not worried there.",z1vyop,2,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z1vyop/kids_birthday_party_keeping_parents_engaged/,parenting
218,Signs of Aspergers in 3 year old?,"What are some signs of Aspergers and what are some ways in which one as a parent can start to intervene?  We've been watching our daughter, who turned 3 in October, start exhibiting strange behavior, and we're not sure how to start addressing it - people tell us a lot of this is normal but something doesn't feel right.  We've observed significant regression in her speech patterns, but she learned to speak very young (at 1) and was very advanced for her age until recently so her regression means that she is now still within range of normal for her age, yet she used to talk a lot more and more clearly.  Many of her strange behaviors, such as her obsessions and compulsions, are things that people assure us are ""normal toddler behavior"", but something feels wrong to us.

One thing we have noticed is selective mutism.  She talks all day to us, in full sentences, with a remarkable vocabulary, but as soon as someone else is around, she either gets really really quiet or makes unintelligible noises with only occasional words.  The thing that compelled me to write this post is that when I went to pick her up from daycare today, her caretaker happened to overhear her talk to me about the sign-out book (one of her obsessions), and seemed surprised that she talked at all!  She called another worker over.  ""Look!  She talks!  And she talks really well too.""  At first I didn't realize that they were talking about my daughter and when I realized it, it hit me like a ton of bricks.

The main thing we noticed is her obsession with routines, and with keeping things within routines.  She has certain rituals that we must abide by, otherwise there are huge meltdowns.  For example, we have to go through a very specific scripted conversation, with me standing in a very specific place (she positions me within centimeters) before we brush her teeth at night.  If I deviate in the script or in my standing position, she loses it.

And she doesn't let things go.  Most kids can be distracted from something, but she doesn't forget and she keeps coming back to it.  Her daycare lost a dress of hers, she's really not taking it well, and she's not forgetting it.

She has an intense attachment to her clothes.  She has full tantrum meltdowns if she needs to be changed in the middle of the day or the middle of the night.  She insists on wearing the soiled clothes.  Even socks that have gotten wet and muddy, she refuses to take off.  It has just gotten worse as she has gotten older.  I put on a shirt with different pants than I usually match the shirt with, and when she realized it mid morning at pre-school, she lost it and didn't let it go all day.

She has trouble with fine motor skills, and seems to just get frustrated when encouraged to practice or shown how to hold a pencil.  She used to be very enthusiastic to learn.

She is extremely stubborn.  She refuses to use the toilet.  When she uses it, she insists on taking off her pants and pull-ups completely off her legs.  She has huge meltdowns if you try to keep her pants on up to her knees or ankles. She refuses to accept new ways of doing things.

Many of these things could be the result of our situation since the pandemic. We have been very isolated.  We moved to where we currently live shortly before the pandemic, so we don't have close-by family or friends nearby.  We don't have a social network here.  We are also older parents, in our 40s, and our daughter is the only child on both sides of our family - I'm an only child and my husband has two unmarried older sisters.  So, we are just not around children.  It's been hard since the pandemic because my husband is immunocompromised, so we are still taking precautions and not participating in indoor social events.   We do take her to pre-school and daycare because we realize that she needs to have a social life, but I wonder if not having a social life at home is hindering her social development at school.

I noticed her interactions with other kids is awkward.  She doesn't seem to read them.  She talks to them when they are ignoring her, she ignores them when they seek her attention.  At school, she's usually doing her own thing in the playground, which seems strange to me because with us she is very social and interactive and involves us in her play.

EDIT TO ADD: Yes, I understand that Reddit cannot give me an evaluation, and we do plan to see a child psychologist to get her evaluated. Of course we are seeking professional help, that's not what this post is for.  I was just curious to hear/read your thoughts and experiences with similar issues.

224,"Almost 4 year old, it’s too much","Is it normal for your kid to literally get upset over everything it seems? Everything “bugs” her, being a made up wedgie, a hair on her arm, just very very minor things.

I understand. Little body, big emotions.  But I can’t stay patient like this all day. The sound of that wine is enough to make me want to punch a wall then I start feeling depressed and I don’t know. I feel like I’m doing a bad job but I’m trying.

Update:  thanks so much for the responses. Truly means a lot. Today was a MUCH better day. I’m thinking her moods are also swayed by her sleep quality. The nights she wakes in the night more than once = watch out for the next day.  Last night she slept all night and was a completely different human.

225,Too much excitement?,"I like taking my 3 year old son for swimming where we usually stay for 3-4 hours. He loves every second of it, we spend the whole time very actively (so it's exhausting for me too) but it's also useful since he's learning how to hold his breath under water etc.

We usually go twice a week. My wife said that I should only take him once a week, because it's ""too much excitement"" for him. In the last few days he had problems peeing and she thinks it's due to stress and too many exciting things happening in his life. Like yesterday we went for a train ride. I don't think going to the swimming pool is too much for our son, and also he really wants to go. 

But I could be wrong on this. Maybe this is like watching cartoons, where of course he wants to watch cartoons, but it doesn't mean they're good to him.

226,Pregnancy hormones or reasonable reaction?,"My FIL came to visit from out of town for the weekend. He was looking after my 1 year old while I was cleaning the kitchen. I looked over and saw him giving her sips from his coffee mug. I snapped, ""that better not be coffee you're giving her!""

He just laughed at me and said, ""it's only a little bit!""
I told him not to give my daughter coffee and he just laughed again and started telling my daughter, ""your mom is no fun!"" (but he did stop giving her the drink).

He does this sort of thing all the time and the coffee incident is a relatively mild example, imo, but I can't help but still feel really mad over the whole thing. However, I'm also pregnant so I'm wondering if I'm overreacting or if this is worth bringing up with my husband?

227,Experiences with plagiocephaly helmet at 6/7 months,"Hi, my son is almost 6 months old. When he was 4 months I noticed a flat spot and saw the specialist, who said it was mild/moderate and did not recommend a helmet but ""would do one if I wanted."" We decided to wait and see for a couple months and reassess at 6/7 months.

We revamped our routine and he spends no time on the back of his head while awake. Everything is tummy time, being held/carried, or sit-me-up chair. Despite all that his flat spot has gotten even more noticeable and now we really want the helmet.

I will be getting the referral when he is 6 months on the dot and have an appointment for the fitting 4 days later. With luck he will be in his helmet at 6 1/2 months.

I am looking to talk to people who put their kid in a helmet around this age as I'd like to have some insight into what to expect before meeting with the doctors and orthotists.

Questions:

1) how old was your child when you started the helmet?

2) how severe was their flatness? (mild/moderate/severe is fine)

3) how long did it take to notice an effect?

4) did the child react to the helmet at all? Changes in sleep etc?

5) how did the helmet change your care? Any tips? In particular I'm worried about starting solids and the helmet.

6) how often did you have to go in to have the helmet adjusted?

7) how long was your child in the helmet total?

8) did you need to get a SECOND helmet? This is a big concern for me as my insurance only covers 1 helmet in 12 months.

228,"Best Friends 9 y/o accused of being a ""child molester"" *possible trigger warning*","TL/DR: My best friends 9 year old son is being accused of out of character inappropriate sexual behaviour & I don't know what to think or how to move forward with our normal relationship.

My best friend is currently in a relationship with a new(er) fellow. They have been seeing each other for roughly two months. Best friend has a 9 year old son, and fellow has 4 children from a previous marriage. Thus far, they have done a wonderful job of introducing and combining the two families when needed, and my best friend has done a great job of being the bigger person with the fellow's ex wife. Which as anyone in these situations knows, can be complicated.

A week ago, the ex wife reaches out to both the ex husband and my best friend- with accusations that my best friends 9 year old son sexually assaulted her 5 year old boy. She immediately jumped into "" your son is a child molester and my children will never be around him again""  which as a mother, who was apparently assaulted at one time- I can almost relate to- I understand the urge to protect and I understand how emotion can take over and we can fly off the handle.

Now, when questioning all of the kids, it sounds as if my best friends 9 year old and the 5 year old were goofing off in the car when left alone, they originally said they were mooning people walking by, then it was said that the 9 year old said the other little one ""had to pull his pants down or they wouldn't be friends anymore"". It was also said that there was another bathtub incident where one of the older girls told the 9 yr old boy to touch the 5 year old. Please keep in mind, part of my issue with this whole scenario is I am only getting bits and pieces of information as the drama unfolds.

Both the 4 children from previous marriage and my best friends 9 year old have a history of lying, particularly recently. The 4 children from the previous marriage, all have a rash of issues ranging from being banned from tik tok for sexual content (AT TEN), one is in therapy as she walked in on her mom sleeping with her dads best friend, & one of the younger ones has been caught watching porn on multiple occasions.

My best friends 9 year old, in my experience is a pretty shy and innocent kid. Raised by a single mom he has been a momma's boy, who has always seemed very kind and gentle. I have babysat him on multiple occasions and never suspected anything off.

My two problems with this are:  My best friend is one of our only reliable baby sitters, and I mean MY BEST FRIEND. With everything that has gone on, I don't know if I should trust her kid, (I definitely don't want my son around the ""step"" children) but I really have no idea how to feel about what has gone on. Was this a matter of children being curious and doing fairly normal things? Is there a possibility my friends son was assaulted and is now acting out?  is there a chance something DID happen and my best friend refuses to see it because it was her son? Is it all being blown out of proportion by a woman (who is honestly mentally unstable from my experience, but again, this is what I am being TOLD).

Part of me thinks I have nothing to worry about as far as my best friend and her son go- but what if 3 years down the road I find out I was wrong? What if I am endangering my son?  The whole situation makes me sick.

On top of those feelings, I am trying to be a supportive best friend, with what I feel like is tid bits of information, from two protective mothers who refuse to say anything bad about their own children and want to blame the other parties.

Advice/similar experiences are welcome.

EDIT:

It seems that because I did not detail the following facts, it appears that I am making a ""tragic situation about myself""

\-I am obviously devastated for my friend, true or not. I would assume that stating that she is my best friend implied that. My friend is an utter mess, but I didn't ask how to deal with that- that part I know how to handle. I am here for her regardless & my support is unwavering TRUE OR NOT. As a mother myself, I can not even fathom what her and her son are going through. It will be life altering for both of them, true or not.

\- I do question some of the parenting/co-parenting choices that have been made here, a few people have mentioned that 2 months is way too fast to introduce kids or have them bathing together, (they were not actually bathing together, they were just in and out of the room as the one child was bathing- but still) to be honest, I questioned this as well. However I am a new mom myself and did not know how I would handle this situation. Combined families are tricky but my gut feeling is that 5 children ranging in ages/sex's need to be supervised ESPECIALLY this early on.",z1z41z,2,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z1z41z/best_friends_9_yo_accused_of_being_a_child/,parenting

Urgent care Dr said it’s fine to fly. Pediatrician he saw the today says he is “technically fit enough to fly.” But pediatrician is concerned because LO is less coordinated than usual (more tripping/falling) and he slept poorly the first night and pediatrician says it may be a mild concussion.
Just wondering if anyone has experience here. Even if it’s (probably) not detrimental to his health to fly, I am reading that flights can be painful for concussed individuals and make their symptoms worse, and it’s already going to be a very stressful flight for LO and for us (and the other passengers!).

233,Mil is too soft with my 3 year old son and I'm done being enforcer mom,"to start, My mil has some financial troubles and her and fil lives with us. She takes care of him when he is not in daycare. She is very caring and attentive, but I feel she struggles with giving good guidence to my 3 year old son in some matters.

A few things like:  She doesn't really monitor how much cookies he is eating so she starts out giving him that in the morning -  and then I see it again in the evening so I am always concerned about him eating too much cookies in a day. She doesn't cook and only know how to cook very basic things so I try to make food for my son so she can feed him that... I just don't understand how she doesn't cook for her self but I'm trying to understand not everyone knows how to cook or are interested in doing so. Maybe that is the old fashioned part of me that says parents need to know how to cook. Regardless,  I make sure I make food for him to eat during the work day but he doesn't eat on his own when it is the type of food to use spoon or fork - we mostly have to spoon feed him , and that is partly my fault for not allowing him to be messy eater when he was an infant... But I feel like she should know not to do all the things he ask her to do, like I do. I just feel like it's basic stuff and I have to tell her to not give in to all his whim.  He also likes to have on iPad for kids channel on YouTube, but she doesn't really enforce how much time he is allowed to watch, so it's always in the back of my mind that he is watching too much. At several points I tried to potty train him with regular boy underwear and try to teach him to clean up after he made ""uh oh"" and encourage him to use potty... I taught this method to my mil and she did it for few days, until she gave up because my son said no. From that point on I raised my hand and took a break from full on potty training for a few months, and since I'm full time working. That's when I put him on daycare hoping he could learn more from his peers and teachers. 

With all these said, I don't know if I am being too anxious, or if my mil is a too soft with her grandson, not really teaching him the rules or know how to teach him to do things on his own that are in his ability. I don't know how to approach this subject because I don't like confrontations, but I always feel like the bad cop here. Is she spoiling him, or do I need to slow my role here?

234,Discipling a child with Violent Outbursts?,"I have a 2 almost 3 yr old child who has a tendency for violent outbursts. When he is told No, and explained y he can't do or have something, when any boundary is clearly outlined he has a massive breakdown. 

Example: he goes into the fridge to get milk for chocolate milk, I tell him he can't have chocolate milk because we don't have any chocolate but he can have milk for his cereal, I pour him some milk for his cereal. He becomes inconsolable and I move him away from the fridge. I put the latch on the fridge to prevent him from reopening it. He then charges at the fridge screaming trying to break it open, shaking it, I was scared he would bring the fridge or something on top of it down on himself. I pick him up, still screaming he begins smacking me as hard as he can. So I put him directly into his bedroom to calm down. When he stops screaming I let him out, by taking his hand, saying we should try again. 

I have a small home with another child who is 3 going on 4, so there is not a lot of places outside his bedroom I would consider safe for his tantrums. Most of his tantrums consist of him banging his head on the floor, attempting to kick doors down, breaking things etc. When he's not throwing a tantrum he's extremely sweet, bright, smart and helpful. He has been evaluated for cognitive issues and passed with colors, he has is passing 4 and 5 year milestones at his current age.

I don't have an issue with this, I love that my girls have friends who do this. I love being the house the kids all go to but it's weird to me and I'm not sure I'd be comfortable if it were reversed. My kids aren't allowed into homes without my knowledge.  This was how it was when I was a kid. Playdates were arranged and my parents needed to know where I was and who I was with at all times.

We recently moved here and we moved out of a really bad neighborhood. So I'm easing into feeling comfortable letting my girls play around the neighborhood. At this time I can't imagine them walking into other people's homes without my knowledge. 

My oldest is on the spectrum, she has a hard time understanding certain situations and my youngest is only 7. Sometimes I feel like I'm being too strict.  Am I being too overprotective?

I wrote this in the comments but feel it may be worth mentioning in the post. 

I do know a lot of my neighbors and I've met a few more after their kids have been over a few times. It's a small neighborhood with a very small school. I volunteer at the school a lot and have met most people, but nothing has ever been pre-arranged and I don't have contact information for most of the parents. I'll definitely  be more vigilant about getting this information from the kids. 

It feels like a lot of the parents here are okay with their kids doing this. I guess that's why I'm wondering if I'm really the odd one out and being too strict.",z1wm4c,1,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z1wm4c/am_i_too_protective/,parenting
236,Custody of Nieces and Nephews. Need advice or kind words.,"I posted several months ago about my sister and her children. Well I'm back. Looking to vent but also advice. (On mobile sorry for errors in structure). TW***

My sister is in her 30s with 3 kids (6, 4, 3). The eldest was on India since 2020 and finally got home 3 weeks ago. my sister's ex husband's family wouldn't give her back. My sister's ex is in prison now (since the spring) and she's going through a rough time. However, she has some severe mental health problems and an alcohol addiction. To try and keep this short, past events are:

-jail for child endangerment for driving under the influence with the kids (youngest wasn't born yet). 

-suicide attempts (she's had I think close to 10 since the oldest was born and has been hospitalized several times). 

-running away and disappearing for several days at a time. 

Yesterday her boyfriend calls and says she's in the hospital because she got drunk, took a bottle of pills and cut her wrists in the tub, she was seizing when he found her. I called local law enforcement and got permission to get the kids, they are currently with me. However, she got released this morning and is wanting to come down and get the kids. I think this is a horrible idea. 

I've called and made a report to DCF and contacted the local office but the case worker said she can't do anything until she gets the report which could be today or next week. 

I don't know what to do. I'm so worried for the kid's safety and I don't want my sister to take them back until she gets the proper help she needs. 

This is a lot. I have 3 kids as well (8, 6, 1). I work from home and am the only income.

Over the last 2 weeks I have fallen ill with a severe liver infection. The medication I was on was horrific. It made me sleep all the time, I had, nausea, no appetite, lost a lot of weight, etc. I was not able to do anything that I normally do at home and I am haven’t been myself. 

It seems that my son has developed some anxiety about my illness. I don’t get sick often. He has been vomiting for the last few nights and saying that his tummy is swirling around. He has asked to stay home from school and lays on the couch beside me all day. I try and do something with him but I just don’t have the capacity to (that sounds horrible I know). 

Last night he began to cry at dinner time and said he feels sad but he doesn’t know why and can’t describe the feelings he’s feeling. 

Any advice on what I can do to help him? My boy is just not himself.",z1mieq,3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z1mieq/anxiety_about_moms_health/,parenting
240,(Almost) 5 year old son and colors,"Today during breakfast i asked him which color bowl he wanted for his cereal. He picked purple. As i was putting the other bowl away

 he says ""purple is for girls"" 

I replied ""there are no boy or girl colors. everyone can like whatever color they want"" 

He says ""well so-n-so said its for girls""

I told him ""if anyone tells you that, you tell them there are no boy or girl colors and all colors are for everyone""

What can I expect to come of this? Will he be bullied? Will the other kids even care?

Edit: when i told him he can like whatever color he wanted he happily ate his cereal and said ""i like purple"" with a big smile. I dont want him(or me) to lose that",z1vteq,0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z1vteq/almost_5_year_old_son_and_colors/,parenting

243,What age did you stop getting on your kids about their clothes being weather-appropriate?,"Or did you never stop?

My 11yo son decided that there was absolutely no way he would wear a coat this morning to school. The temperature was below freezing. He was wearing warm-ish pants and a hoodie, but we were worried he would get cold. 

He’s in middle school now, so we are definitely seeing him assert more independence and we want to give him more agency over certain things, but this was something that I didn’t let go of right until I dropped him off at school since it was so cold out. 

He had the coat with him in the back of my car, but when I reminded him to take it, he said he didn’t want to. There were cars behind us and I didn’t want to hold up drop-off lest I incur the wrath of the people shepherding the line. So, I let him walk into school without it. He doesn’t really go outside when he’s at school, so I wasn’t worried about him shivering at recess. I guess he’ll learn some natural consequences……

245,What to do when little boy (4y) who defies promised actions?,"Sorry for my broken English and long text, I don't know how to shorten it without explaining the subject. Hope, I not breaking any of rules here.

My son have big box of mixed things: different shapes of bricks, Lego pieces, magnets,  toy characters, etc. And he loves to play with them, but at the end of the day they everywhere in the room. It is my wife who usually collect them back to the box, some days a few times a day.

Once he turned 4, I decided, that he must collect his stuff by himself. So, when time comes, I sit in mess he creates, started collecting toys in the box and tell him: ""Come, help me collect your toys"". He always rejects with some reason: ""I don't want"", ""I'm tired"". When I argue with him and tell: ""Why you don't want? You are the one who did this, and you should collect your things you throw around"" and he just points finger at me and says: ""I didn't do that, it's you!"" How to deal with this?

So, I tell him ""If it is me who did this, then I'll collect this all, and I'll throw everything in garbage, you agree?"". He replied: ""Yes, agree"". I asked a few times. So I collected everything and I trowed it in the garbage and he witnessed that. He was upset about that and cried a lot. But I explain him many times why I did that. After he went to sleep, I took his stuff from garbage and hide it in the  storage room, because I knew that this all stuff is important to him, he loves them and kids need toys, so eventually I'll have to buy such stuff again.

Four weeks later, actually, yesterday, he saw something on tablet and tells me that he want to build a clock from bricks. I say that we don't have any. But I know we have. So, I speak with wife, and we decided to reintroduce those toys back to him if he promised that he'll be collecting them by himself. And he promised that! He was so happy to have them back, and he played a lot, like they brand new. And when time comes to collect toys, he did collect it all!

But today he started his old song: ""I don't want"", ""I'm tired"", ""It is not me who did it, it is you"". So I tell him, that if he'll not collect his stuff, he'll not see it ever again. He is understood what's about to happen, and I repeat my words many times, but he still refuses to collect his toys. He is kinds of protesting or want to be true to his word, I don't know, but he cries and yet says to me that he not did that, and he will not collect toys. So, I collect everything in a bag and throw it in the garbage...

Now I don't know what to do. I don't want this situation to repeat. Kid for sure need toys, but if I told him that ""I will throw out everything"", then I should keep my word for that. Maybe I should act differently in first place? How do I fix this situation?

247,5 year old ALWAYS sick,"I am venting...My 5 year old has been with a bad constant cough for more than a year. So far this year she didnt cough in June and most of July however, by the end of July things got back to constant coughing. I am so annoyed by anyone that tells me this is normal. This shouldn't be normal. Mid October her cough got so bad that she was having nose bleeds and coughing up blood. I have spent so much money on Urgent cares and nobody does anything. No prescription, no in depth checkups but just a ""she is fine"" and "" its normal"" is all I get. I have taken her to the ER and nothing. I always get sent back without any hope. 

She vomits almost every other night because of her cough. This is so annoying y'all! I understand that kids get sick a lot. I get it! But this is not normal. She has been in daycare/school since her first year. 

I cant believe that there isnt something they can do and that i just have to have her suffer like this. 

I have tried essential oils, natural and herbal syrups, otc meds, cool mist humidifiers, sleeping in a sitting position, vicks, teas... I feel like i have tried everything and she just doesnt get better.

249,Parents who work from home - how do you manage?,"Hi fellow parents! I'm specifically shooting for parents of toddlers but anyone with experience here, please feel free to chip in! 

We live in a country where we are privileged enough to be able to hire a nanny to care for our toddler (2.5 years). Last week, our nanny suddenly stopped showing up and we were  suddenly thrust into caring for our toddler full time + working full time. Prior to this, our child rarely watched tv but we became heavily dependant on it the past week out of desperation in order to be able to work. She has toys but when she has no one to play with, she quickly starts depending on us for entertainment or cries and whines a lot + trying to climb on us while we're on our laptops. Aside from the TV, we take turns taking her outside for a walk and reading/playing for some time. She also has a pair of headphones and we sometimes will let her listen to music/read-alouds on our phones but she quickly gets tired of this.

However, we have really enjoyed our family time, spending every day together (just the 3 of us). I worked from my office yesterday and took my daughter with me. My colleagues loved meeting her and it was a nice break of monotony from staying at the house. 

We're interviewing around for a new nanny but we're also considering keeping it like this for some time. Maybe until next year... maybe longer! 

So I'd like to know how you guys manage to do it! We definitely would like to keep her off the screens but also out of mischief! How do we help her learn to play independently? Would it help to create a set schedule excluding screentime? Do we need to set up lots of out of home activities? Play dates?

FYI - screen time consists mostly of Super Sema, Jojo & Gran Gran and Octonauts

250,Venting about non existent grand parents.,"Just need to vent somewhere. My poor fiancé has our toddler (almost 3) seven days a week, 24 hours a day. He’s a great kid and gives us a minimum amount of trouble. Obviously occasional tantrums but otherwise is the best most loving and cuddly boy. I work 5-6 days a week most shifts being 12 hours and my poor fiancé can’t get a break unless I’m home. 
My parents are perfectly capable of watching him. They were good parents growing up and raised 4 kids including myself. They always ask for more grandkids every time we see them but don’t want anything to do with the two they already have. My brother has a 5 year old who maybe they see once a month on a good month. And in the three years of my child’s life they have taken him 3 or 4 times. For no more than two hours. They always say they are too busy with church and my moms gallery shows to spend any time with their grand kids. They don’t even call or text to see how they are doing. Every time they do see my son my dad sits on his phone and hardly talks to him and my mom just complains about having no time even though she could easily make time. Recently my dad had the realization that his grandkids don’t really want to talk to him or even ask to play and doesn’t understand why. YOU DONT DO ANYTHING WITH THEM WITH THE SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME YOU DO SEE THEM. The last time we were over with the rest of my family my nephew asked my father if they could go fishing and my dad just looked up from his phone and said, “fishing poles are out by the boat.” And looked back down at his phone. Didn’t bother trying to bond with them at all. 

My fiancés parents weren’t the best when she was growing up. She didn’t have the best relationship with her mom and her dad was kinda absent. There but not emotionally available. So she had a very hard time growing up. The relationship is better with them now but she flakes constantly. They live 45 minutes away so it takes some planning. Just today we had plans to drop my son off with them for an hour so we could do some birthday shopping for him. Well she just texted and said her throat is a little scratchy so she can’t. But she was well enough to go to her horse stable and will more than likely go to the bar tonight. This has always been the normal with her. Too tired or not well enough to spend time with him but well enough to do fun stuff with her friends. She has maybe taken him a total of 10 times in three years. 
Me and my fiancé have been on a total of three dates since he was born other than that he is always with us. We’re so emotionally and physically drained and there is no help available to us. I don’t make enough to afford daycare so my fiancé can’t work so she doesn’t get any escape of any kind. 
I understand that they both already raised their kids so in their eyes they are all done. But that doesn’t stop both grandparents from asking for more grandkids. ( to not spend time with or even check in with for that matter )
My fiancés parents will at least buy him a jacket if he needs it but my parents have bought him maybe three things his whole life. And money isn’t an issue, they have plenty to go out drinking at breweries and go camping and go out to Adult bible retreats. Just none for their two grandkids. I’m so tired man. I just wish we had someone we could count on to watch him for an hour so we could go on a date or go grocery shopping in peace. I guess that’s a lot to ask for. 

Thanks for reading my vent and hopefully you guys have better grandparents available. 👍

Edit:more context. 

My mother practically begged us to move closer when we lived about 50 minutes away from them. She said they would watch him every Monday because that’s her day off and any afternoon after that so my fiancé could work. As soon as we moved if we even mentioned her watching him she would exhale and say how busy she is and has too much in her plate to watch him. I don’t feel entitled to childcare but I do feel entitled to what she said she would do but doesn’t. Growing up she always said she wants 8 grandkids (two from each sibling) and she wanted to be the grandma cooking cookies with the kids on Christmas and have her house full of her grandkids on weekends. Until she actually had them, now she has too much going on.

I only mentioned the money aspect because with my fiancés parents they will at least remember us saying he could use a new jacket and while walking through Walmart will see a jacket and say, “hey, i remember my grandchild needing a new one.” And grab it. It just shows she thinks of him sometimes.

My job has a $2,000 sign on bonus with 500 at your 6 months which was over looked recently. And I've been told that I'm probably no longer going to receive it due to my call ins. I'm so frustrated because while I completely understand why it's not like I can just send my kids to school and daycare with the flu. My husband makes over double what I do, so it makes zero sense for him to take off over me. I'm sure if I worked anywhere else other than here I'd be fired by now. I'm just so flustered I dont know what to do.

I dont have family that can take them. My husband has agreed to try and work with his schedule to hopfully salvage my sign on bonus but if we cant i think I'm just going to leave my job while this wave of sicknesses pass. We can afford for me to not work but It'd just be tight. My job is mostly ""fun money"" anyway. 

I dont expect a pass just because I have kids but it seriously sucks when me having to call in is unavoidable. My boss is understanding but the owner is less then. These gross sicknesses need to go away.

Recently mom got a new job with a 1.5 hour commute and has to be up at 0530 every morning to get there on time. 

I tried to sub for her but it was constant screaming and crying. I think we should just put them to bed, turn off the light and  shut the door. Mom feels guilty that they cry too long. I have a long day as well with rise at 0630 get them ready, drop off at daycare, be at work by 8-815. Work all day, pick them up, make dinner and care for them until mom gets home at 630pm. 

At the end of the day both of us are just spent and 2 hours of sitting in the room trying to get them to sleep without crying is just too much. 

Am I being too cruel to just force them to go to bed regardless of the crying and screaming? 

Also daycare used to be like this for the first few months but now they are better. I am trying to explain that to my wife that they just need to get used to it.

262,To parents of guitar players or wanna be guitar players,"******Dead offer now******

So IDK if this is allowed but I figured I’d share with you because it’s an AWESOME deal & it could be a great Christmas/Holiday present.

My kid just started learning the guitar. Apparently, FB algorithm decided to send me guitar content. So, Fender has a learning app. It’s $150 for the year. They’re running a promo where you buy a year subscription to the app, and they will send you a Fender electric guitar, amp, bag, chord for the amp, guitar stand, etc…FOR FREE. 

I was skeptical but I figured I’d try it…and I’ll be damned if the package didn’t just arrive at my house. 

The app is pretty awesome too.

I’m going to wrap all the things up for Christmas gifts. My kid is gonna lose his mind! And it was free! I’m sure it’s not a perfect guitar but it’s better than anything I would have shelled out for. 

I’m not sure I can post links, so maybe try some Google-fu ‘Fender free guitar online lessons play’ 

*this is not a scammy post, just trying to share my experience to help some fellow parents out.*

Edit: go to google. Type ‘free guitar fender play’ third and fourth result. One is from guitar world. There’s a link in there, which will take you to the fender app.it’s still up as of 4:03pm today. I’m sure you can find it other ways, but this is how I found it today.

265,3 year old refusing to poop in toilet or potty,"My three year (37 month) old daughter has been peeing in the  toilet for about 5 months. She’s pooped in the big toilet twice and pooped in her little potty 3 or 4 times. She’s got excellent control of her movements (she will hold it for as long as necessary). 

I’ve tried everything I can think of. Reading her books on the toilet, letting her watch videos on the toilet, bringing toys to the toilet. I sit with her. I offer to leave.

267,"How to deal with a very clingy, anxious 6 yr old","My daughter has been experiencing increasing anxiety for the last 6 months or so. We have an intake scheduled with a child therapist in February but have been trying to figure out how to manage things until then. 
In the last couple of weeks, though, she's gotten super clingy to me. She keeps saying things like, ""I want mama, I need to stay with mama"" and telling me she loves me all the time, but in a sort of anxious/upset way? Hard to describe. 
Every time it's her dad's turn to do bed, she melts down about wanting me. She always wants me to stay until she's asleep. When I go out, she gets upset. Today she refused to go to school. This is the third time it's happened in the last year... So not a ton but not a pattern I want to encourage.
We have gotten books about anxiety and worry, tried things like a ""worry box"", that kind of thing, but she hates talking about what scares her. Even if you just mention something that scared her (a fire drill at school for example), she gets really upset. When you try to explain why we prepare for things like fires, even though they probably won't happen, even more upset. 

We both work full-time and can't have her just stay home, but I'm also not the type to force her out the door when she's upset. I'm worried that whatever I do will make it worse, though. 
My style is more gentle parenting whereas hubby is less patient and gets frustrated with these meltdowns, which is a challenge in itself. 
Do I just accept this as a phase and let her cling as much as she needs to? Or do I set firmer boundaries? Should she get consequences for not cooperating when she says she's scared? 
I'm just at a loss - I want to do whatever will help her feel safe and secure, I'm just not sure what that is.",z1o59y,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z1o59y/how_to_deal_with_a_very_clingy_anxious_6_yr_old/,parenting
268,Teenagers and attitude.,"Idk if this like normal. Or of I'm doing soothing wrong as a parent. 
My 14 year old has the meanest attitude. 
She is just mean and something beastie to say to everyone around her. I mean she sat there telling me today hoe much she hates her family and when she leaves she's never coming back because she just hates us. .and I'm just sitting here thinking i know we've hit some rough patches. But I've always made sure they had what they needed or wanted.  
(She doesn't even really know, and I'd never tell her bc she's a kid, but I go without so much so they can have)
So will start with last night, I had to get a splinter that was embedded in her hand out. As I'm doing it I get it hurts. But she sat there just saying really cruel things about how awful and useless I am. 
Every single morning she asks me to comb her hair, and i do. While she bitches at me the entire time. 
I finally told her if she wants to sit there and yell at me and be rude then she can start to comb her own hair. 
She looked st me like i was the most evil person in the entire world. 
And I'm just wondering is this like normal it's been a while and ik I had some teenage angst but Idk if I was just down right mean to my mom. 
has anyone else dealt with this? I try not to let it bother me so much, but the mom guilt is seeping in, and should I just suck it up and comb her hair and allow this rebellion?

269,Is it rude to send younger sibling home? Is it rude to not feed kids?,"To give a run down, I have a son who is 9 and we have a neighbor with 3 kids, who are 8, 4-5ish and 1 year old. The 8 year old and my son are great friends they don’t see one another often (different schools) but when they do they are great together. The 4-5ish year old is a great kid too but comes over less often and shows up randomly. And it can be a hassle as I feel responsible for what he does and what he gets into with the age difference. To be honest their mother and I do not text or communicate when the kids want to play, they show up here (either together) or just that 8 year old to play only at my home. My son either goes to get the oldest or the oldest shows up randomly. Which has seemed to work. 

Yesterday, the 8yr old came over unannounced to play, no issue they played all day.  

Today, my son went to their house to get just the 8 year old and the two came back together to play outside as per usual in our yard. The 4-5 year old came shortly after unannounced walking by himself and I decided to send him and the 8 year old home as it was almost lunch time and I didn’t want them all inside my home (not that I need to say why) but I am studying for an exam. Here’s where it got tricky, the 8 yr old said to me, I’ll take my brother home can I come in. I made a split second decision, and I said sure. -go walk your brother home.

About an hour or so later, the 4-5ish year old shows up and tells his brother it’s time to go his mom wants him. Later I get a text from the mother stating; 

“Hey how are you? I just wanted to ask how come 4-5ish was told to come home while the others stayed and eat?
 He told me that he was told he couldn’t eat and to come after they are done eating?” 

I said; 

“I am sorry, I realize now that was rude of me and probably should have sent them both home. I am studying for a really big exam that I have tomorrow and was worried with (4-5ish) age I wouldn’t be able to leave them unattended. Originally I ask 4-5 ish and 8 year old to both go home while (my son) ate and (my son) would come back to get them. 8 year old asked if he could stay and that he would just take 4-5 ish home. I am sorry if that caused trouble.”
 
She said; 
“Well I teach my kids to be kind and share and think about the other person. It’s was very hurtful for my son to be told to go home while others eat, (8 year old) staying was very wrong of him , he should’ve come home with his young brother. And yes both of them should’ve been sent home. And it’s not trouble but I raised my kids different. I wouldn’t have done that even for a second. The fact he was told to come back after they ate. I can’t allow they around”

I said; 

“You’re right, my bad, I should have sent them both home. I completely agree with you. I based my decision on talking with (8 year old) he thought it would be okay to be sent home, I made a split decision, as (8 year old) has been over here multiple times without (4-5ish) and I was not able to watch them all. 

I also teach my son to share, be kind and think of others. 

Again, they are always welcome and I will send them both home together if I am not able to watch them both together next time.”

She then said;

“I think they will be staying home from now on. Thanks though” 

I ended with I am sorry you feel that way… 

Am I in the wrong here? Mind you her and I don’t talk, we give random waves and she doesn’t ever have my son over there to play. Yes, I understand it was my bad for not just sending them both home. But is it wrong to send only one? (I have only one). I am also the youngest in my family and was sent home alllll the time. My parents always said “yeah you’re too young.”

270,Toddler up 120+ times in the night. HELP.,"My son is 2 years and 10 months old. Ever since he was nine months he has slept through the night. Bedtime is a ten minute job for us. Blissful.

Last night after we left his room he came to the door 120+ times and each time I had to put him back into bed.

Started out with some kind of request (‘want mummy and daddy bed’, ‘need a wee’, ‘want my teddy’, ‘pick me up’), he then proceeded to take every book off his shelf between each door open. For the last 45 mins he would just come to the door, see I was there, then around and put himself in bed.

After two hours of this (opening door at least once a minute) I stayed in the room with him with my hand on his back until he fell asleep. Took about five minutes.

He then proceeded to wake up every 1.5 to 2 hours throughout the night crying for mummy and we had to do the same ‘hand on back soothing’ thing. By 5am even that didn’t work and wife just got in bed with him.

Feels like pretty major and sudden sleep regression. This is newborn vibes.

See my post history for a little context leading up to last night.

The hospital admission last year scared his mom and me horribly and we are struggling to get past the constant worry that he isn’t gaining enough weight.

She would only wake up once or twice per night, nurse then go back to sleep. 

Now she will pretty much only go to sleep if she is nursing but then wake up immediately once I lay her down the majority of the time.

291,Nanny Drama - What would you do?,"Both me and my spouse work full time. We have a nanny come to watch our 2 year old during the week. We have a cleaning person come once per week- usually Friday or Sunday. We live in a two bedroom apartment in New York. We currently pay $25/hour for the nanny and pretty much live paycheck to paycheck outside of our retirement savings and money we have put aside for the child's education. 

We have had this nanny for over a year. At the one year mark my spouse went back to work full time and we considered sending our child to day care for half days so he would be exposed to other children. The nanny said she could not reduce her hours (day care would have meant 8 hours/week cut from her schedule). After much debate, we decided to opt in for more nanny time rather than day care and signed him up for a weekend class to play with other kids.  

At this point we noticed an attitude shift from the nanny, particularly towards our pet. The nanny started complaining about the dog jumping on her when she arrived and sometimes peeing to punish us/her for leaving her alone in the apartment. (The dog has bad separation anxiety). 

We opted to pay for additional dog training and went every Tuesday after work for 2 months. It didn't really help since the behavior is anxiety based. She already knew how to sit/lie down etc. 

Last week the dog peed again and the nanny sent us a picture of the pee on the floor saying ""we need to talk."" 

After a weekend of worrying she was going to give us an ultimatum of the dog or her, she sent us an email, filled with criticism that was completely new to us. In the year and 4 months we have worked with her, we had never heard her complain about the cleanliness of the apartment, the child's food options (we normally have eggs, yogurt, fruit, Gerber's microwavable meals and fruit squeezes) or the child's laundry. 

The email was basically the nanny requesting a raise, citing the additional duties she has taken beyond caring for the child. These include keeping the house clean, doing laundry and offering meal prep for the child... and us. She attempts to justify this request for more money by saying she is taking on the role of a house keeper as well. 

The concerning part is that she says she had almost quit on multiple occasions, which is completely shocking to us. If we had known she was on the brink of quitting, we would have opted for full time day-care as we were considering this past August. 

As mentioned, we already have a house keeper come once per week. We don't make a ton of money and so the idea of paying more for someone to like.... cook our meals is really not something we had anticipated. I was particularly taken back by the tone. She is normally overly bubbly and friendly and then suddenly in this email she is saying that she ""cringes"" when she sees our child has slept in his clothes. (I'm not saying it's right for the kid to sleep in his day time clothes but it's not like he is living in squalor.)

292,After school pick up - don’t drive HELP! Mess!,"I have two kids, DD6 and SD10. 

I work 8:30-4, my husband works 2-10pm

DD6 goes to a bussed school from our district. Her bus stop is a 7 min walk from the house. I can get her on in the morning before work/as can my husband. She is busses home and is at the stop at 3pm. 

My SD goes to a school far away, and busses back to moms. We have her 4 weeknights every 2 weeks. School ends at 3:30, busses home by 3:50. Can be home alone for a bit. 

I take the bus to my job and we don’t have a second car - my husbands job is far away (25 minutes) and there’s no busses at 10pm. 

Any idea how I can make this work? Both kids have the option of an after school program at their schools, but I’m not 100% sure if this even helps. 

We have very little family support available. How would you make this work? I have to get my daughter everyday and my step daughter 2x a week.

293,4 Year old pretending to be a baby,"Going on 3 months now, my 4 year old goddaughter has been intermittently pretending to be a baby. At first, she would do it occasionally and it was no big deal but for the last couple of weeks she’s started doing a lot more frequently, like 4-5 times per day. I know this type of role-playing isn’t always concerning at her age but I’m starting to worry that it’s not so much “play” anymore and becoming regressive. Her mother and I shower her with positive attention, have been very supportive and of course want her to express herself. However, the behavior is a bit obnoxious and it’s getting difficult to remain patient during these times because there doesn’t seem to be a solid pattern of when this happens. It’s anytime, whether we are home or out doesn’t seem to matter. She will just cease speaking, moving, etc. as her 4 year old self and go full on baby mode. If anyone has dealt with this kind of thing before, any advice would be greatly appreciated!",z11r2j,7,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z11r2j/4_year_old_pretending_to_be_a_baby/,parenting

My 9 year old is always sick. And this didn’t just start after covid or when he started school. He has always been this way even as a baby. I’ve been told by doctors that it’s just allergies - it’s not. Nothing for allergies has ever worked for him. He will also be sick for a couple weeks, fine for a couple weeks, and then sick again. I’ve also been shrugged off and told that some kids are just more sick than others.

300,13 month old screaming,"My 13 month old constantly yells and screams at the top of her lungs when she doesn’t get her way/what she wants. It’s not like she’s crying with tears or anything like that, it’s more of an angry yell. The minute we give her what she wants she stops immediately, so I’m pretty certain she knows exactly what she’s doing and does this on purpose. 

We have tried ignoring it, responding with a stern voice, telling her to use her words, etc…but she often resorts to yelling angrily. When she first started doing this I think me and my husband doomed ourselves because we would laugh (it was a lot cuter when she was smaller lol), and now I think she resorts to it party for that reason and partly because she gets what she wants.

301,"MIL drama and 5 year old ""tattling on Grandma"" comes out a few days later","Wasn't sure if this should go int he JustNoMIL sub or here sorry?

Kiddo is almost 6, only grandchild, husbands parents are local to us, but not for long we are looking to move asap (as soon as our jobs will let us move (looking about 3 hours away). We are both 32. Husband has two younger siblings, I'm an only child if that helps. My parents moved away about a year and a half ago to take over the grandparents' farm. My parents were a huge child support for us - weekly date nights out etc. We lost that support and felt the struggle - My in-laws being not available often hurts.

The story - kiddo (finally) gets a sleepover at grandmas and the next day is a birthday party from a classmate. We pick kiddo up at dinner time the Saturday, and she's sheepish - not her usual self at all. Says she had ""just a little bit of fun."" Grandma kind of hurries her out the door and that's that. Husband sticks around to talk while I load kiddo up.

1. Husband relays not much other than MIL was upset that kiddo was up at 430am and woke MIL - MIL refuses to allow kiddo her own space and they share a room. Kiddo sleeps at her bedside ""camping"" with a sleeping bag. FIL has his own room. The other bedrooms are downstairs, and kiddo is fearful of basements. FIL cannot do stairs. Anyways.
2. Today, Monday, at bedtime kiddo is sitting with me after Storytime and goes ""The reason I didn't like ""(names) birthday is because grandma wasn't there to help when the bigger kids called me names"" I said oh? Where was she? She goes, ""She went to get groceries she dropped me off and came back when the party was done."" ... so I went, oh well that isn't very kind. Was she there to have pizza (something exciting at least). Kiddo goes ""No (friends) mom had to help me, and she yelled lots because I was too silly.""
3. To top it off, kiddo goes today as we are scrolling through YouTube from cosmic kids yoga there is the hint of a thumbnail, and she goes ""OH! Diana and (something I don't remember)... Grandma lets me watch that."" I said, Oh?? (I hope not...) ""Yes she does, lots. While she does other stuff."" Like I totally understand Grandmas house isn't a paradise but c'mon!!

So I'm just not sure where to go from here. Kiddo was crying that she'd get grandma in trouble but I'm more worried about Grandma now... Am I overthinking and being protective of kiddo? They have overstepped us before so maybe I have defensives too high.

&#x200B;

EDIT TO ADD: 

The party was a ""stay and play"" party. MIL was briefed ahead of time it was a party to stay at it was 'only' for an hour maybe 1.5 hours tops.

For YouTube -NO to this specific content, we have greenlit other content (names, types etc) but no to this specific creator. She has said ""great, thanks!!"" but has not followed through - and let kiddo take it unsurprised multiple times :(

Regarding kiddos own space -- FIL has his own space, MIL says she needs to hang on to (grand)kiddo and refuses to give her space but gives her the floor... Honestly, I'd be happy with the couch and make it a fun camping experience -- get the tent!! or make a fort! But not the foot of the bed on the floor on a sleeping bag and some towels. :( They have a 5 bedroom place and it's just... frustrating for me.",z1ig05,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z1ig05/mil_drama_and_5_year_old_tattling_on_grandma/,parenting

After school isn't a concern because our schools have daycares they can go to after school until Dad can pick them up, but the schools don't have any sort of before-school childcare.

318,My 3-year old daughter is quick to anger and outbursts. Any advice/feedback appreciated.,"I have a daughter who is 3 years old and 4 months.  She can very much be a jolly, friendly, sweet, loving, playful, angel who cares about others.  But she has another side that rears its head at least once per day.  This side of her is quick to anger, takes on a harsh/yelling tone, won't share with others, asks to be carried, and has tantrums if she doesn't get her way or if you respond to a question/request in the ""wrong"" way.  

Not to make excuses for this behavior, but we did have a new daughter born about 4 months ago.  The daughter at issue also started preschool (5 days per week, 5 hours per day) in September 2022, and recently potty trained around this time as well.  Even prior to all of these changes, which I don't want to discount, she was a fussy baby who showed signs of being easily upset over a year ago at the age of 18-24 months.  She did have bad reflux (we switched to HIPP, which helped), and she saw an occupational therapist around 12-18 months to help her chew solids.  She has also seen a speech therapist and physical therapist to help her be more nimble for her age, both of which have helped, but her intelligibility of language could still use some work.

Sometimes I don't know which side of my daughter to expect.  For example, let's say she asks to watch something on TV in the morning.  If I say ""No, maybe after we get dressed and eat first,"" she might take the response calmly and say, ""Ok, Daddy.""  Other times, she will get upset, ask why not in a very whiny tone, and overall work herself into a tantrum despite redirection, despite being calm with her, despite being consistent with her, etc.

Other problematic behavior includes asking to be carried often and having a meltdown when we refuse.  She also struggles sharing toys with others and tends to look at things as ""hers.""   We've worked on sharing, have read books to her, have modeled how to share and how it makes others happy, etc.  But it's still something she struggles with.

I know some of this sounds like typical toddler/preschooler behavior, but recently she'll have meltdowns when other kids don't, like when getting dropped off at preschool (relatively new development - she used to be fine with it, and nothing has significantly changed, though we did change to no diapers about a month ago).

320,How to talk to children about their mom and other custody issues?,"
So we are in a long custody battle.  The most recent order has brothers (full) being split up 5 days a week and only seeing each other on wknds because the teen got tired of living with his mom
and wanted to come live with us but mom refused to give up The 7 year old so the judge just gave one to us and one to her with the kids seeing each other on wknds.

We told them repeatedly the brothers did not want to be split up (teen even told the judge he does not want to be apart from his brother and would prefer that he come with him) and this would be hard on the younger, but I guess they want to do this temporarily for 6 months to see how they do.

It has been one week on the new schedule and 7 year old on our wknd is throwing tantrums, saying he wants to tell the judge to give him his brother back and he wants to go back to the “old days” when they both lived with us.  It is hard to discern what is real and what is children trying to say what they think a parent wants to hear.  I (stepmom) was just talking to him the other day after he screamed at me asking him what was going on with him and if he was ok as this was not usual for him.

He told me “its his mom” and “he has been so angry lately” because his mom “makes him so mad”.  I told his dad and we asked him what happened and he told us:

1) his mom shaved his head bald and basically threatened to take his toys away if he didnt let her do it.  He doesn’t like his haircut.

2) his mom puts him in timeout if he gets his homework wrong.  He was crying and she told him to “shut up”.

we also know she “smacks him” and at one point left a nail mark on his arm (small, not bruised or anything).

This isn’t to say mom is abusive or terrible, she just sometimes gets stressed out and i think lashes out at the kids.  She is usually nice to the kids but has a pattern of not putting their needs first if it benefits her.

we are worried about him dealing with not seeing his brother, feeling bad because his brother gets to come over more and he has to reduce time with us (he used to see us almost every wknd but now its  every other wknd, due to the judge wanting brothers to have wknds together at each household).  So far we have not said anything negative about his mom just encouraged him to express his emotions to us or her - eg, “when you say this it makes me feel sad” and talk to his mom.

How do we talk to him about this and help him? Therapy is difficult as we are not able to take him seeing him only every other wknd and his mom is not reliable or trustworthy (she has tried alienating him in the past and telling him to stay away from me, dad is trying to take him away from her, etc).",z151dd,2,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z151dd/how_to_talk_to_children_about_their_mom_and_other/,parenting

But I’m honestly feeling a bit scared? I am not sure if the tree will be too heavy or if it’ll be just an overall difficult process. Also, looking at the farm online. There’s so many pictures of traditional families with dads and moms. My nephew is already insecure and a bit self-conscious about not having a traditional family unit with his mom and dad in a home.

323,Seasonal depression hitting much harder now that I’m a dad.,"I’ve always struggled with seasonal depression. Pretty much from October through the end of February I’m in a down state. The holiday season stresses me out, I hate the cold, I hate the snow, I hate that we only get like 8 hours of daylight, I hate the constant onslaught of  Christmas music from Halloween to New Year’s Day …. The list could go on. I’m not a happy camper in the winter months. Christmas has always kind of bummed me out specifically though. The stress of either hosting or attending holiday events makes everything feel like an obligation. Family members that I wouldn’t piss on if they were on fire giving me all sorts of input that I don’t need or want. The financial and psychological stress of buying gifts is only made worse by the guilt of receiving nice stuff and fearing that I didn’t get something nice enough for the other person. Wrap all of those feelings in being told I’m a grinch or a Scrooge for not loving every second of it and I’d rather spend Christmas alone. My wife on the other hand LIVES for Christmas. She loves everything about it, so I feel awful sharing my misery because it brings her down, which in turn makes me feel worse. 

Well, this year a fun new layer got added to the mix in the form of my daughter. Now I’m stressed about being stressed. I don’t want my shitty mood to rub off on her. I want to spend quality time with her enjoying the holiday but I just struggle so much with the big sad. I want to make sure she gets nice things, but all of these other less important people in my life are sucking up my money. I want to sing Christmas music to her, but every time I hear Mariah Carey’s voice I want to jump in front of traffic. And the guilt is SOOOO much worse. I feel so much sadder/angrier/stressed out now than I have in the past holiday seasons and the idea that I’m sharing that with my daughter makes me feel sick.",z14f4j,2,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z14f4j/seasonal_depression_hitting_much_harder_now_that/,parenting

My brother lives very close so he can help if anything else happens. 

We're just a little afraid. Our daughter is very attached to us and we feel a bit guilty for leaving her alone. Wanted to hear about other parent's experiences in this case. Our daughter gets attached to my mom, but my mom doesn't live here so it will take a bit to warm up back to her. We should definitely start telling our daughter that she is staying with grandma even though she might not understand, but we're not sure if we should say goodbye when we leave or just leave to not make it harder for her.

325,We don't have a calm second with our newborn,"Hi everyone,

I know there are similar posts, but I would really like to know what other parents say to our specific question. Is it normally to not have more than 5 minutes a day where our newborn is awake and happy and one can actually ""play"" a bit with them?

Our daughter is 5 weeks old and we are constantly feeding here, changing diapers, then she sleeps or cries and everything starts over. We would like to do some belly time with her for example or put her below the mobile. But if she is awake it takes maximum 5 minutes and we have to either change diapers, feed her or something else makes her uncomfortable.

We just passed a sleepless night because she had a rash from her diapers. Before on the weekend she was fussy the whole evening and we couldn't even go for a walk because she just wanted to be fed. Before that she had colics or something similar that made her uncomfortable.

I know having a newborn is hard, but is this normal? Are there no calm moments? I at least have the moments when I change her (if she is calm) where we can interact. My partner doesn't really have any of those moments because she takes a break after feeding her.

326,Huffy grandparent not doing as you ask,"Does anyone else's parent go in a huff when you ask then to stop doing something that is negatively impacting their child?

For example, our 1 year old is easily distracted during dinner and his grandparent comes over for dinner once a week. Grandparent keeps talking at him during dinner so the wee one wants to keep interacting with him.

Grandparent is saying the usual ""eat your dinner, eat up, is that nice, yum yum, etc"" but nonstop, and obviously the wee one just wants look round all the time. So we keep asking them to try to ignore him during dinner as he doesn't know what you are saying and you're just distracting him.

Then they make some smart arse comment and go in a huff.

EDIT:
Thank you all for your feedback. I'll admit I was on a bit of a rant as this is one of a bunch of low level annoyances and was aimed more at grandparents attitude towards a polite request rather than the specific situation.

The comments vary from one extreme to the other, so I think a happy middle ground would be to not sweat the small stuff and enjoy the time they have together, but try to explain our requests to reinforce our boundaries.

327,Toddler Always miserable. Please tell me this is just a phase?,"My 3 year old is always miserable. He just sits on the floor or couch and whines all day. Every meal is a battle. We don’t even force him to eat and we never have. Me make kid friendly versions of what we are eating and he can come to the table when he’s ready. But it always ends with him screaming on the floor that he doesn’t want lunch/dinner. He doesn’t seem to want my attention because if I go sit on the floor and play with him he just continues to scream next to me. Doesn’t seem to be teething either. We are just tired of it. Every single action is a meltdown. Brother walks into the room, meltdown. I go to the bathroom, meltdown. Cat goes upstairs, meltdown. 

He has his happy moments, but they are overshadowed by the just seemingly hours of misery. 

Please tell me this is normal and it’s a phase we will eventually get over. Because right now I really don’t like him. He goes to my parents once a week and I’m just counting down the hours.

As I sit to write this out my son is 2, going on 3 and I'm at my wits end. This child in, span of 20 mins, got I to my 1lb tub of Vaseline. (I use it for womd care, as using too much triple antibiotic ointment can reduce it's usefulness) and while I'm cleaning that up he's in the kitchen getting into he minin chocolate chips, dumping half the bag on the floor. I have tried time outs, spankings, talking to him, yelling. He gets into everything he's not supposed to and refuses to play with his toys. He wants everything else. Only time I can have 5mins to get anything done is when I give him my phone. He has his own but it's lost (because ofc it is) he has a highchair that we use for time out but he can unbuckle himself. I'm sick and of chasingess after mess. It's like 20° out rn and thos little mofo has decided we don't need heat, and turned off the heater. Didn't know he did till it got cold in the house. It's taken me 2 hours to write this out as I keep trying to keep his attention elsewhere. I have tried playing with him, watching tv, getting him to play with his toys. It's exhausting. I have never seen a toddler act like this. I really don't need hate. Please. Mom to parent. What do I do?

335,Investing and personal finance for the SAH parent - what's your strategy?,"I've been SAHM for a year now, and will continue for another 6 months until my child is in preschool at 18 months. During the past year I've had 0 ""earned income"" but have gotten maternity leave pay from work, and the state (through disability for childbirth and PPD).

It's my understanding that I can't contribute to any IRA or 401k obviously due to not having earned income - I'm still unclear whether the income supplements have tax liability or not. It's difficult to get an answer because it's very specific to my state (CA) and the fact that I've been on extended disability (and not PFL).

Due to my income level pre-maternity leave, and the untaxed income supplement, I've been able to save a lot of cash this year. What I'm confused about is how to invest it if I'm not eligible for the obvious options.

I'm a first time mom, and postpartum life has thrown me for a loop. I used to be organized and tidy with my finances, now my life feels like a dumpster fire.

337,My cousin cut my son's hair and I'm slightly annoyed,"my son (2yo) has super curly hair like I do, I'm talking like 3b/more so 3c. 
I love his hair but because it is so curly, it does tend to get tangled quite easily and also since it doesn't appear to be as long in some places vs others (thanks, shrinkage), it can seem uneven at times. 

I made the decision (honestly with some pressuring by my cousin and her husband) to cut his hair about 8 months ago because it had gotten to the point where he was constantly getting tiny knots all in the individual strands of his hair from his wild sleeping and he was still freaking out about washing his hair. I wanted him to learn about caring for his hair but at the time, doing anything with it just seemed to make him upset and I felt we were sacrificing the quality of his hair. plus his had actually grown in unevenly since infancy so I got it trimmed down to the length of the shortest piece and we've been growing it back out since. 

This time around, he's warmed up to doing things with his hair and has started helping to care for his hair (brushing, oiling, washing, etc) so I've decided that we'll cut his hair if he chooses to. 

Now, present day, he went to stay with my cousin while I was in the hospital with my best friend during her delivery. 
My cousin is also very hair care forward like I am (we are both mixed and learning how to care for our hair pretty much on our own as our parents didn't really know what to do with it has taken up a lot of our lives so its just an important thing for us I guess.) but she is also more conservative than I am in the sense that she usually feels boys should have shorter hair. Her and her husband are always asking when he's going to get his next haircut and I always answer with ""whenever and if he's ready"". 

She texted me today for an update on my son and mentioned that she had just ""done his hair"" and that she ""trimmed a little off the sides"" he now has a fauxhawk and I'm honestly kind of annoyed. He still doesnt get the full understanding of his hair yet and at the moment and says yes to damn near everything so she very well could have asked him and he said yes but I also highly doubt that she did. 

So now i'm going to go pick up my son and ik its probably stupid but I may cry if its really that short 🙃",z0dlox,70,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z0dlox/my_cousin_cut_my_sons_hair_and_im_slightly_annoyed/,parenting
338,Ideas to help my 10 year old son with digital media?,"Okay, I'll try to make this as concise as possible:

I have a 10-year-old son and I perceive how digital media is gaining traction and other activities are taking a back seat. (We are talking about Fortnite, Stumble Guys, and YouTube gaming channels. He doesn't have a smartphone yet.)

There is no crisis yet, he is doing well in school, still doing things with the family, doing chores etc. Neither it's about his total screen time, we have some restrictions in place (an hour a day during work week) and he is as compliant as you might expect from a 10 year- old. The system might be leaking but the overall time seems acceptable.

But: We feel that even if not actually sitting in front of the screen his mind is very much drawn to it, surely hoping for the opportunity to use it when we are unaware of it. That starts blocking him from doing anything else – or anything else just has lost its appeal?

E. g., he has played soccer for four years now and always loved it, but recently stopped going. Not because he doesn’t like it but because „he doesn’t feel like it“ (or feeling headaches or bellyaches) when the moment to leave home arrives. So even if he commits to some activity in general, when the moment arrives he backs out.

Right now has no structured activity from 4pm on - doing essentially nothing (reading comics, listening to audio dramas, taking a bath…), waiting for his screen hour to start at 6.30pm.

340,"Parents separated and the other one is refusing to do anything for his kid, need advice","Hi so I wanted to talk about child support and custody agreements. Me and my sons dad split over 3 years ago. He made things impossible despite me trying to work with him, so I took him to court. He slacks a lot when it comes to our son and he wasn’t getting him to school when we were attempting 50/50 on our own. There were other issues but that was one of the main ones so I had to take him to court and I was given the majority of custody and he gets 3 weekends. Since then, he has only paid at the highest $7.85, in child support for 2 weeks at a time. Currently I’m getting nothing. He is a drunk and does drugs and apparently he is too busy for his son. He won’t keep a job at all either. He doesn’t pick him up like he should for the weekends but even when he does, he bails him off on everyone. One time his then girlfriend even messaged me telling me she felt bad for our son because he was never home and would go to the bar instead of spending time with him and she was watching him all those times. He moves a lot and I heard the same from a few other people he lived with and still have in writing. He promises our son that he will spend more time with him or get him extra during the week, which he is more than allowed to and I encourage because my son wants to see his dad, but it’s all lies and he never goes through with it. My son is 8 and starting to act out bad because he misses him. Which tbh is really stressful on top of doing the work for me and what his dad should be doing.

When he is with him, they don’t do homework. He hasn’t done it at all yet with him. He doesn’t make him bathe or brush his teeth and lets him stay up till 2-3 am waiting on him to get home, if he comes home that day. His dad is usually hung over when I pick son up on Sunday and I’m getting sooooo frustrated. He doesn’t buy him anything or help at all and the whole $7.85/2weeks in child support isn’t shit. So I told him nicely and professionally I suppose, that he was not doing what he needed to and I’m getting tired of it. I told him that I should not have to be both parents because he can’t be mature at all. Also, since I buy everything for our son, I got his Halloween costume this year and as hoping his dad would actually spend time with him and take him trick or treating so I sent it there with him. He wouldn’t even bother getting him one and going otherwise, and of course it didn’t come home. So I asked him to return it and he got mad at me saying it isn’t a big deal but since he does next to nothing and I just bought it not even 2 weeks beforehand, I wanted it back. 

He still hasn’t returned it but demanded me to return school clothes to him that sons dads mom (sons grandma) bought. I told him no because he didn’t even buy them to begin with and that is all I’ve gotten for school from ‘him’. That he still needs to be helping me! So now when he goes for the weekends, his dad takes his good clothes and sends him ones with giant holes that he can not wear to school. 

I am honestly exhausted with this and have tried way longer than need be to be nice. I can feel my blood boiling at this point. What do I do? Print all this or what? What will the court do for this kind of thing? I need some kind of help from him because I’m struggling right now to do everything on my own. And I’m tired of asking nicely. Will they give him less visits? Is it a waste since he was already ordered to pay almost nothing? 

Just to add, It frustrates me even more because he tells everyone he pays a lot in child support and that he’s always there for his son and that I make things difficult for him. He says he’s ‘doing his best’ when he can’t even pick up the phone and call him, and that his life is ‘chaos’ that he can’t do things anytime I ask because he’s ‘too broke’. But then goes on vacations and goes out drinking very regularly. He’s also only been working 4 hour shifts while I’m doing 12s to try to make things work. Will they make him get a better job or make me pay him since I make more? Which would be NONSENSE if they did make me.

I will say that there is a culture difference and a language barrier so that doesn’t help.

Mainly his mother likes to “tell” me advice all the time which some I don’t agree with and it goes against modern medicine. Recently, my baby was sick and my mother in law came over to give my baby a remedy. I wasn’t comfortable with it as I felt the safest thing for my child was to drink milk and let the virus run its course as she’s too young to take medicine. I allowed her to give my baby this remedy though despite my feelings on it because hey, maybe she knows something? Plus I hate confrontation. Well the next day after my baby didn’t eat for 3-5 hours, she only drank a half an ounce and it sent me into panic mode. Thankfully she ended up being fine and it wasn’t the remedy causing it but the guilt I had thinking that it was, was immense.

Another example, my family threw a welcome party for my baby the day we came home from the hospital and never ask if I or my fiancé were ok with it. People came in and didn’t wash their hands or wear a mask. My fiancé said nothing to them about it as he didn’t want to be “rude”. Thankfully my baby didn’t get sick. 

To keep this short his family seems to just do things without asking me or my fiancé. My fiancé is laid back so he doesn’t care enough to say anything. He thinks I’m just being too protective. I have a whole list of things but these two examples I’ve mentioned were the icing on the cake and the main reasons for me making this therapy appointment. My fiancé just lets his family do whatever and I feel that if I speak up, he won’t have my back even though he always tells me to just voice my opinion to them. 

As horrible as it sounds, this has caused me to have thoughts of wanting to abandon him and my baby because I feel no one respects or considers me and they would be happier if it was just him and his mother raising my baby. Yes, logically I know me disappearing won’t fix anything and would just make things worse. I also don’t have the heart to and would never abandon my baby. It’s just that my issue with confrontation is literally so bad, I’ve had these thoughts. I also feel like I’m a bad mother because I can’t seem to stand up for what I feel is best for her and I just end up with anxiety in the end. My baby cant speak and I know that I’m her only voice right now.

With all this said, I’m starting to second guess going to this appointment for fear of how I’ll be seen because I can’t seem to voice my opinion and stand by it. I also fear that they’ll think I’m an unfit parent and take my baby from me if I reveal to them that I allowed my baby to be fed something that I was uncomfortable with and goes against modern medicine. Should I still go? I feel awful even typing this but I feel like I need help at this point",z16cx6,1,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z16cx6/dont_know_if_i_should_go_to_my_therapy_appointment/,parenting

344,Nice way to correct chest clip placement?,"My husband’s best friend and his wife are new first time parents. Every time I’ve seen them or seen pictures of their baby in the infant seat, I’ve noticed that the chest clip is way too low, like over the baby’s belly instead of over the sternum, and I worry about potential injuries if they were ever in an accident. I am friendly with this couple but not super close with them and don’t want to come off as rude or judgy. How do I gently/nicely tell them that this is a safety issue?


Edit: thank you for all the suggestions! After talking it over with my husband some more, he actually came up with a great idea for how to handle it. I’m 31 weeks pregnant right now (my second, his first) and his parents just bought us a car seat. My hubs was going through the manual tonight and when he got to the part about chest clip placement he sent his friend a picture of it and basically said that he’d never known this before now but had noticed that friend’s baby’s chest clip was placed lower last time we saw them.

347,It's been a morning,"I'm married with two kids, 11/ M and 7/M. Getting them to go to school without a half hour ""talk"" almost never happens. I dont expect them to jump out of bed and boom for the door, but a half hour conversation followed by me saying ""Look, you just have to go. There is no way around it."" every day is soul draining. I feel bad for them bc I understand how lots of kids have gotten used to being home with family since covid. My youngest struggled with it a lot last year, and were back at it this year.

This morning my oldest told me that he'd rather be ""up there"" bc ""what's the point to life when it's always hard?"" That made my hair stand up and we talked until at least 8:30am. Depression and anxiety run in the family, my husband has severe depression (hes on meds and is high functioning) and I have BPD (Ive been in DBT treatment for 5 years now, I meditate 2x/day, Im stable, and I take meds as well) so between the two of us we have a lot of history, and also a lot of skills from having to overcome our own bullshit. My husband told him that when he was his age he had feelings like that sometimes too, and I gave some (child appropriate) insight from my experiences as well. He assured us that it was just a feeling, what we would call ""ideation"", rather than ""tendency"". Still doesn't make it any less terrifying.

We didnt freak out, outwardly, bc we don't want him to feel like it's not safe to talk to us but I couldn't hold in the tears. After we all spoke I just held him and told him that I couldn't imagine life without him, we were both crying. He has a therapist that he sees once a week (today, actually) and also sees the guidance counselor at school if he needs to. He has had a hard time adjusting to middle school, and had some bad experiences so far (there was some hazing in the beginning of the year, he's had balls thrown at him in gym, and someone violated his privacy in the bathroom one time) and we have been diligent in talking to the school authorities about all of it. The kid from the bathroom was caught and that was taken care of, everything else... I mean, it's middle school. These are the things that build scar tissue. Everyone goes through it.

Before his first class he hangs out with the assistant principal for about 5-10 min just to get in the right mindset. We've talked about trying a different school, but middle school is middle school. It's the hardest time no matter what school you're in. At least that's my opinion, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. We got him to go in, Ill be picking him up right after, and then at 5:30 he has his appointment. 

So this morning my husband went in to work super late, bc he was not about to just walk out after hearing that, and my youngest didn't get to school until 9ish bc I drive them both. School starts at 8. That's not the problem though, I'm just saying. 

THEN, when we get to my youngest's school at 9, *he* starts crying bc he doesn't want to be away from me. I sat in the backseat in front of the school holding him while he sobbed and hugged me. He said he was going to miss me too much. This went on until 9:30. I had to call the school guidance counselor to come out and help me get him in the building. 

My heart is so heavy and I feel lost. We shower our children with love, bc our childhoods were awful. My husband and I promised each other that we would give them the exact opposite childhood that we had. Unconditional love, togetherness, fun, unbreakable bonds, and so far weve done our best to achieve that. And still, they're struggling so much. I'm at a loss. This is not my main account bc I'm scared of the responses I'm going to get, and still I'm willing to wade through the judgmental yuckiness in case someone out there has any solid advice that maybe I haven't thought of. 

Just as an aside, I realize that everyone needs a mental health day once in a while and sometimes we allow that. They both get good grades, theres no reason to believe that a day here or there will be deteimental to their education (which is laughable as it is). However, they were both sick for like 10 days with this sore throat/stomach/cough bug and already missed too much school. I can't keep them home this time bc it only perpetuates the difficulty in going back into school. I felt that my youngest needed to go in so he could see that he will survive without me. Even if it's a hard day.

349,“I want mummy and daddy bed”. HELP.,"Hi there. My son is three in January. Since he was nine months old he has - no exaggeration - slept through the night every night. 7pm to 6am / 7am. We have had it easy.

On Saturday he woke us halfway down the stairs at about 5:30am. He’s never left his room before. Turns out he’d wet the bed. Fair enough.

For his Saturday nap (normally 1.5hrs) he woke up shouting twice and managed 45mins in all.

Last night… Christ. Woke up shouting he wants in our bed at midnight and this leads to two / three INSANE hours of putting him back in his bed around thirty times.  

Eventually we caved as you need sleep right? So he’s in our bed but very restless. Very patchy ‘sleep’. Not a long term solution.

This morning as you’d expect we all feel rotten.

So i don't know, do you have any ideas to make it better? What stuff could i do with them? I'm not much into crafts, and we don't have cartoons during the week.

They are capable of playing nicely for a couple of hours, but it usualy ends in tears. Also as soon as I ask them to do something (even very mundane), they start to complain / cry / yell etc. Amongst the two of them my husband and I are constantly frustrated, since one of them (or both) is always resisting or crying (at the drop of a hat). 

On a typical week morning, one of them will resist going to kindergarden, the other won't dress himself, they will complain and delay brushing their teeth and combing their hair, hate their shoes etc. Mornings are mostly stressful. When they get home, one of them will usually whine about something as soon as he steps through the door. Lunch is no good, then they fight each other a bit, maybe play a little, but at dinner time they whine again. We try to be upbeat and calm, but it is getting harder and harder to do that as they get older.

My ex and I have separated when our daughter was months old.

 I started bringing up this issue when she was still breastfeeding at age 2.  Initially taking it likely and joking about how she should at least stop once she reaches high school.  Also dropped some game of throne references here and there.

I am beyond jokes now.

The frustrating part is besides this issue my ex is actually an intelligent reasonable person. A very involved, caring, nurturing, self sacrificing mother.  I think she's just damaged emotionally on some level, which is the root cause of this bizarre attachment problem.

We've had the discussion numerous times.

She keeps saying that she's working on it but that mostly she'll stop when daughter ""is ready"" to stop. Words n words. No action.

This wrong on so many levels, Don't want to get into it, We could write a book on the implications.

Part of the issue is she won't sleep over at my place because she is used to always sleeping with mommy and more than occasionally breastfeeding still.

365,Portable TV to minimize eyestrain,"We allow our kids to watch a small amount of TV/video per day (30 min, while I'm cooking dinner).  Currently, they watch it on an iPad (10"" diagonal).  However, because of the small screen size, they have a tendency to put their faces all the way up next to the iPad.

To minimize eyestrain, I think we need to buy some sort of screen that's a little bigger.  We don't have a traditional TV in our living room, nor do we want one.  This TV/tablet/monitor will be stowed away in a closet or under the couch when not in use.

Any suggestions on portable TVs or tablets that are big enough that the kids can sit a little further away?

* E.g., 16-24"" screen (big enough that it doesn't cause eyestrain, but small enough to store away under couch when we're not using it)
* Built-in battery that lasts for 30+ minutes (no cords to trip over)

The issue here is what makes people think that i’m gnna save clothes for 6 years for it to finally fit her. Why not return it or give it to someone who could use it. 

Another thing that’s similar and annoying when they ask for her size and i tell them and then they say no she needs a bigger size and buys her a few sizes up.

372,What is the best approach to inappropriate content in son’s web history?,"Please forgive possible errors, English is not my first language.

I (father) found intimate apparel shopping sites with explicit images of women in my 11 years old son's browsing history. We are using Google's Family Link on his phone. As parents who use it might know, its web filtering is not very extensive. 

I am trying to protect my son from porn and sexually explicit content. This is mainly because I don’t want him to be ok with the value attached to women in that type of content and I also want to protect him from harmful psychological effects of porn and its addiction. However, trying to do so, I don’t want to become too limiting and I don’t want to invade his privacy.

In previous occasions, I tried to be open with him and tried to convey what is healthy in terms of sexuality and how derogatory to women some of these contents are. I implemented content filters for everyone including him and explained that I want to protect all of us.

Now he found some way to access explicit images (through shopping sites) and I am not sure how I should feel about it. My first thought was to find a wat to filter this content too. However, I don’t want to go as far as limiting shopping sites. Moreover, I want to teach him to use his internal control mechanisms better without causing too much stress. I know he is experiencing urges he newer did before and it’s not easy.

I will find the opportunity to talk to him on a dad-and-son night and reiterate my thoughts and views on the subject and try to express being sexual is healthy and normal but seeking satisfaction through explicit images is not. 

What do you think would be the most elegant way to approach? Would you recommend better filtering software? All views are welcome.",z0yfly,0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z0yfly/what_is_the_best_approach_to_inappropriate/,parenting

378,Racist man yelled at my kids and I lost my shit on him.,"So the title kind of says it all. In our building we have many amenties, I went to the club lounge/game room with my young two children, a man was working in the corner on his laptop. He got annoyed by my children playing in a room meant for playing/entertainment. I was sitting on a seat about 2metres from my kids. 
He decided to directly shout across at literally a toddler and a primary school aged child. He was aggressive with his tone and so degrading to my kids. He scared them.

Before I lost it on him, I told him to never shout at my kids and to address me if he believes he has an issue. He then proceeds to says that he will do and say whatever he wants to my kids and asks me to show him what I'm going to do about it.

It takes a racial turn when he calls me (a black woman) ""uncivilised"" and tells me to go learn how to speak English & overall continues to mock my English. Which was so ironic because I was literally born here, but that's besides the point. The point is that it became evident that he was racially motivated.

I absolutely lost it at this point and started shouting at him to shut the f*** up and not speak to my kids again.

Keep in mind that the building we live in is huge, we have an entire business centre/library/meeting rooms which are specifically designated for QUIET work. And I never take my kids there. We only go to the game room from time to time after school. No one else was in there at the time besides us and that man. 

I decided to call the building security number and as I'm explaining to them what's happening and they say they're coming to the room, he quickly packs his stuff and rushes out before they can get there.

They apologised and said they will do an investigation & that they don't condone this type of behaviour. There are cameras in the room that they're downloading the incident from. 
They also said that we are well within our rights to play as much as we want in a room that's meant for entertainment and that if he was trying to do work he should have gone to the library in the building. 

I will hear back from the building management after this weekend. But I'm absolutely fuming.
The management encouraged me to file a police report but I don't know if that's suitable as there wasn't an assault.",yzib33,2062,197,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yzib33/racist_man_yelled_at_my_kids_and_i_lost_my_shit/,parenting
379,Ex Skips ADHD Meds,"Since the kids don't have school this week, when it came time to switch custody my ex just dropped out 6 year old son off at our house. Over the course of a couple of hours, I noticed that he was bouncing off the walls, switching tasks every few minutes, not focusing etc. I texted my ex and asked

""Did you give him his adhd medication this morning?""

&#x200B;

He said ""No, I don't give it to him on the weekend or days when he doesn't have school""

&#x200B;

I said, ""I don't think thats a great idea. The medication is to help him be more in control of himself and his mind, not just to make school easier.""

&#x200B;

He said ""You need to read up on ADHD and taking medication breaks""

&#x200B;

After a few minutes I wrote back that yes, that is a thing but that it can also lead to re-emergence of symptoms such as loss of appetite and being less effective on the first few days restarting (so if he skips it on weekends, it may not be as effective on mondays).

&#x200B;

He shot back ""Jesus Christ, are you going to argue with me about this too?""

&#x200B;

Honestly that made me see pure red. One of our biggest issues is that I am a very dominant person and I have taken care of the family for years (I was in the Army while he was unemployed) but since we had our son he has a good job and wants to be seen as ""the MAN of the house"" despite a decade of me doing everything. He always harps that I don't respect him enough, I argue with him, I should just submit and be agreeable to whatever he says or wants. HAHAHAHA sorry not happening bub you let me run the household for a decade now you want to be Mr. Man. Not how it works. Also he's mad because our divorce was just finalized last week after a year seperation and he told me afterwards that he's going to get his vascetamy reversed so he can try for a baby with his 42 year old girlfriend of 6 months (he's almost 40). And I had laid into him, in a respectful but firm manner, that while I think thats a stupid decision as they barely know each other yet, arent married, dont live together yet etc BUT that my primary concern is making sure he knows I wont be willing to pay into daycare or switch my son's schools to accomadate being more conveinantly located for a new baby (she live in another part of town about 30 mins away). So he got REALLY pissy about that and even told me that they are older than me (I'm 34) and therefore of course they have thought everything through and know better than I do. (insert eye roll). So basically he's already testy towards me because I was incredulous and firm about my views on our shared child and any possible new baby. (Edit to add- I didnt say anything rude or argumentative in any way. I just said things like, I want to be clear that I am not comfortable switching our son to a school on the other side of town to be closer to where the baby would go to daycare etc so he needs to plan to pick our son up across town and also get the baby from daycare and not think that he will be able to just move my son closer to her side of town).

&#x200B;

Anyways. I'm also livid so I responded ""Jesus Christ, I would think something like our son's medication was something we both had a say in and not something that you soley have authority to make decisions about. Sorry for thinking it was something that would be a discussion. I said you can do whatever you want at your house just that I don't think we should alter his medication routine without talking to the pediatrican first""

&#x200B;

I'm so irritated because several reasons. I dont appreciate his attitude that I should just accept that he's right about it being better to skip medication on the weekend, annoyed over the attitude that I should just submit to his authority on it, irritated that he didnt even tell me that he didnt give him medication before dropping him off with me (his behavior was off the walls enough for me to notice that he must not have gotten his medication) and also annoyed that he's making decisions like this without talking to the pediatician.

&#x200B;

I guess I'm asking- does anyone else skip ADHD meds on weekends and holidays? Is skipping it really actually beneficial/not bad? And I guess just venting about the situation because I'm angry that he spoke to me in that way about something involving MY son that I have as much right to speak on as he does.

382,Is it too soon to move-in together (kids involved)?,"My boyfriend (39m) and I(37f) have been in a pretty healthy and loving relationship for the past year and a half. There have been serious discussions about us building a household and finding a place together next year. Blending families is completely new territory for me, as I separated from my son’s father three years ago and the is man is the first one that I’ve dated whom I want to take this step with. 

My boyfriend is really keen on moving into a new home early next year. He and his ex have been drafting new visitation rights for his daughter (as she lives more than 6 hours away) and he wants to make the transition as smoothly as possible. At first I was on board, but now I am starting to have a bit of doubts that it just might be too soon for us to have a Spring deadline of terminating our leases (three month grace period), finding a place, and blending our families without real ground to stand on.

My concerns are of course the children. While my bf has been making a conscious effort to bond with my son, I had only just after a year of us dating decided to introduce them. During these last six months, we’ve gone on a cabin trip together and have had dinners, outings, etc… but not often enough (I have my son every other week) to really bond. In regards to my bf’s daughter, I’ve never met her. He has a complicated relationship with his ex and they have had a lot of custody/visitation issues. It is only now, after the daughter turns three that he would be able to have sleepover dates without the mother (since the child was very young and very much so bonded with the mother) every other weekend.

I feel, as a mother and a woman at unease with this. That he hasn’t bonded completely with my son yet, and that I don’t know his daughter at all. I understand that the co parenting relationship with him and his ex is on/off at times and I’ve never spoken and or met her. I’m meaning to extend that invitation so that the mother knows who I am as the daughter will be staying with us.

i’ve been the third parent the majority of my life and been wanted to move and be the family member that calls once in a blue moon but it isn’t possible, atleast not right now and probably for a couple more years if ever that.. but this isnt the reason for my post. 

the reason i had to come to this side of reddit is because i need advice yall, i really do. 

its me (F22), my mother(48) and my three (half) siblings (F13, F9, M7) they all have the same dad, im the only one with a different one who i dont talk to like that as he wasnt really in my life. 

their father aint in the picture either (cause i dont count a call once a blue moon as parenting) and a word hasn’t yet been created that can accurately describe how much i loathe him. 

Im barely home because I have to work to support the household, and when i do get home most times im completely burnt out from 12 hour shifts as a cna, so im mentally tapped out but try my best to be there for my family. 

Going into my childhood would probably give better context of her parenting style but I dont want to trauma dump, i’ll leave it at saying it wasn’t cupcakes and rainbows lol. 

my little sisters were raised more gently but she was still strict with them. 

but with my brother?? its a whole different story. my mom is letting him get away with everything. literally everything. after school my boy just watches/plays minecraft all day, eats and leaves dishes everywhere. if he isnt told to pick up after himself every time, nothing will be done.  and she lets it go every time. 

i know its gotten bad when my 9 year old sister texted me saying that my mom yelled at her with a sad face emoji (broke my heart fr) and explained that she was yelling at her for the chores my brother didnt do. i used cute gifs and stuff to try to help her feel better but i know that doesn’t solve the problem. 

she lets my brother get away with soooo much yall. sometimes i cant believe its the same woman who “raised” me. 

i used to try to talk to her about things of that nature and advice her on how to move but she turns it into arguments im too tired to have. 

i try things like taking his device away.. she just lets him get on hers and play away, even telling me to just give his phone back to him. 

i try putting him in time out, she just talks to him (which makes him turn around and forget he’s even on punishment tbh) 

things like this isnt fair for my other siblings, especiallyyyyy my 9 year old because she’s the one thats made to pick up on his slack. (not when im around.. id be damned. but im
not always home) she does all her chores & everything, but then is yelled at like things are her fault when they really aren’t. 

when my plate didn’t have as much on it, i was able to be there physically more for my siblings & i know for a fact that my brother is a good kid, he just needs structure. enabling kids too much harms them more than helps because one day they’re going to grow up into adults who have to navigate into the real  world... but how will he ever learn if she doesn’t allow him to have the chance to?

im not a parent yall. i used to want to have children of my own but not no more lol. i dont want to have kids at all. im just trying the best i can to be there for my siblings but i just dont know what to do. sorry for this being all over the place.. i just dont know what to do.

385,Tween refuses to help improve situation,"I’m using a throwaway account because I know this post is probably going to make me sound horrible. And maybe I am.

My son is 12 and in 6th grade. He absolutely hates school. He’s never really likes school, but this year he’s a lot more vocal about it.  We’ve had multiple conversations with him and feel fairly confident that he doesn’t have any issues with teachers or other students. Academically he’s doing quite well.  He just doesn’t want to spend 8 hours at a place that he thinks is boring. He’d rather be home doing things he enjoys. Homeschooling is not an option right now because my husband and I both work.  We have explained to him that we are legally required to send him to school. Staying home is not an option. He has been meeting with a therapist since this summer, but he’s getting the same feedback: nothing is actually wrong with school.. he’s just rather be doing other things.  I believe that he’d find school more enjoyable if he was involved with extra curricular activities, but he refuses to do so.  The school counselor has also talked with  him.  The school has been willing to work with us to figure out ways to make sure more enjoyable for him, but that requires that our son be actively engaged in finding a solution. But he insists that the only thing that will make it better is 5-day weekends every week

I understand that some kids just don’t like school. But I am about to lose my mind over the constant complaining. Every single night when I remind him to get a shower and get ready for bed, he responds with some version of ‘OF COURSE I have to get ready for school’, follies by ‘why do I have to go. I hate school. I shouldn’t be forced to go’, followed by moping around.  And every single morning consists of ‘can I PLEASE stay home today.  I really don’t want to go. Please don’t make me go’, followed by moping and door slamming, for 30ish minutes and the car ride. His teachers say he’s respectful and engaged in class.

And I end up feeling horrible because I hate that he’s so unhappy.  I impacts my entire day.

Then I feel conflicted because I want to be a parent that he can come to with problems.  But I’m so, so tired of the whining about something that I can’t control and that he refuses to try to improve.  I literally dread seeing him in the morning.

388,Unplanned pregnancy and really scared - male perspective,"Hey so I found out a few days ago that my girlfriends birth control failed. It was supposed to be 99.8% effective, but we’re in the 0.2% I guess. 

I’m really scared. I’ve never had any desire to have a kid, and I even considered having a vasectomy a few years ago. I don’t handle stressful situations well, and I’m living in a foreign country where my job could disappear quite easily. Finding another would be difficult. I always thought I would be a cool uncle and that was it. 

I know she’s scared too, and it’s not the right time for her either. But I’ve found it really hard to control my emotions and accept the situation. 

To be clear, we are not ending the pregnancy. That’s not what this post is about. Im just hoping that someone can tell me that they felt the same and it worked out in the end. 

I don’t feel ready and I have nobody to talk to about it. Has anyone else been through this and it worked out ok?",z0ue7e,0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z0ue7e/unplanned_pregnancy_and_really_scared_male/,parenting

There's always so many unnecessary nooks and crannies for shit to get stuck in that are impossible to reach if you have to wash it by hand.

Mind you, this special brush is like 5 times smaller than any other straw brush I've seen so it gets lost ALL THE TIME.

390,Is my 5yo boy’s interest in wearing lipstick “problematic?”,"My (35f) sweet 5yo boy is on the autism spectrum (high functioning and verbal) but it has been difficult to get him interested in anything within the realm of art, drawing and writing. This morning I was pleasantly surprised when he brought my trio of different shaded lipsticks to me from my makeup bag and said “mommy, can I have lips?” Needless to say, I was tickled by how cute he was asking to wear my lipstick - and that he has been quietly paying attention to me in the past while I did my makeup. To a parent with a child with ASD it is a proud moment when you can learn more about what your child likes to do and take it as an opportunity to connect with them. I loved hearing the excitement in his voice when I said, “Of course you can!” And then let him pick out his favorite color. I taught him how to hold his mouth as I applied it on him and he let out the best laugh when he saw his appearance in the mirror. 

But things went south when I told him to “go show daddy!” And he ran up to my husband to show him the work of art on his lips. My husband’s response? This is going to open doors to a world that he doesn’t want him to know about yet, and that I should be telling him that boys don’t wear lipstick. Personally I think this is ass backwards and would absolutely send the wrong message to him, a curious kid just playing around and experimenting. If my kid wants a full face of makeup I would happily apply it and watch him enjoy - after all, makeup is supposed to be fun! 

Is makeup really the gateway to sexuality in the way my husband is convinced it is? Just for a little background we are a pretty liberal family, my husband is a wonderful and accepting man of people from all different backgrounds and interests and we teach acceptance to our children. But this for some reason makes him believe that we are sending our kid down the “wrong” path. I happen to believe that being LGBTQ+ is something you are born with and not taught, and for the most part my husband believes that as well except he also believes that some people become curious and “choose” to become homosexual based on their surroundings- I think that is bullshit. But is there any truth to it, and am I sending my child down that road? I also would like to preface that we will love and accept our child NO MATTER WHAT, but my husband sincerely thinks that even if our child wasn’t born with these preferences that we are in some way able to shape them for him through exposure and doesn’t want to go there so early.

I’m sincerely asking this because I believe with all my heart that this is straight up innocent (and a little fucked up for my husband to believe differently), and my husband thinks we should tell him no. Is there a right answer I don’t know about?  Let’s discuss!",z14j6q,0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z14j6q/is_my_5yo_boys_interest_in_wearing_lipstick/,parenting

I don’t have any background on her or her style, and I don’t have or spend time with any preteens, so just wondering in general to the parents of preteens, are kids these days generally following trends similar to teenagers based off of social media? At this age, are they still dressing on  a more child-like spectrum? Social media was non existent when I was this age, and I imagine that kids’ styles are generally maturing a little quicker thanks to the prevalence of social media nowadays. Wondering if anyone has any insights on any safe options to get this girl that she will hopefully actually want to wear. I’m steering clear of things like cropped tops since I have no idea if she/her parents are comfortable with that, but was thinking leggings/sweaters/t-shirts? Even if you parents of preteens could give me a basic idea of what your own kids wear, I would take all the insight I can get. I understand this is super vague, and no one person’s answer will be perfect, I’m just trying to purchase things for her that she would actually want to wear.

I've tried getting him to stand to pee, I have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to that and I'm a single mother. Yes I do THINK he might be a bit autistic and I do think there's some ADHD at play (I don't live where it's easy to get seen for diagnosis for these but it's in the process of being done)

395,MIL won’t stop popping my 14 m/o,"For starters i’m doing gentle parenting and she vehemently hates it. “you can’t gentle parent if your kids don’t gentle child,” she says. As most toddlers are mine is incredibly curious and loves getting into everything she possibly can, and with toddler impulse control she wants to continue doing what she was doing before she was redirected.

The incident that has me worked up: I was in the den with MIL, FIL, SIL, and BIL while MIL is holding my daughter in her lap. My daughter is repeatedly trying to grab her Granny’s cup off the tray table in front of her and rather than: put her down, move her cup, or the tray table, she just smacks her bare thigh hard enough to leave a red mark for a bit THEN puts her down. I grabbed her and went into my bedroom to finish out the rest of the evening, not saying anything about why I left the room. MIL chimes in apparently only after she heard my door close and said, “She left because I hit her.” OF COURSE I DID, YOU DISRESPECTFUL BAT!! YOU HIT MY CHILD IN FRONT OF ME KNOWING FULL WELL I’M NOT DOING PHYSICAL PUNISHMENTS ESPECIALLY AS A TODDLER!!! TODDLERS DON’T UNDERSTAND BEING HIT; MUCH LESS GRANNY HITTING HER BECAUSE SHE WANTED SOMETHING TO DRINK!!!!!! The first time this happened she was babysitting, so we decided she can’t be alone with her anymore but what now?? My initial thought was that she just shouldn’t hold her at all but my husband thinks that’s drastic and unreasonable. She did this directly in front of me while my husband was gone and I don’t think she would’ve done this had he been at home.

396,The gift I've been given.,"My son(16) and I(M52) have both been sick at home this past week.  Even though I was more symptomatic than him, I'm still the parent so I still fix meals, get cups of water, medicine, cool wet wash cloths, anything that he needed.  About midweek I realized, at his age, this might very well be the last time that I'm able to care for him like this.  To comfort him like when he was younger.  When he wasn't ""too old"" for me to do so.  

My gift, was realizing this before the moment passed.  How many time have we told ourselves ""If I'd known that was the last time that I'd - seen my grandmother/hugged my dad/talked to my friend - I would have taken care to make that memory last""

So the last half of the week I've been banking memories.  Checking in on him ""too often"".  Running my fingers through his hair.  Rubbing his back.  The sorts of things I may never have a chance to do again.  I've tried to remember with detail all the little things I've done for him this week.

Who knows, he may get sick again.  In which case I'll bank more memories to add to these.  But the important thing, to me, is this.  I caught it before the chance passed.

There's a million little thing a parent does as a labor of love.  We may sigh and huff, but we do it because these little humans are ours in our hearts.  But there will be a last time that we will have the opportunity to do many of them.  Try not to miss it.

402,My two year old basically lives off air,"When it comes to my beautiful daughter, she has been picky since the day she started solids. Won’t hardly eat breakfast (aside from fruit, belvita biscuits, and yogurt) does okay with lunch (mac and cheese or chicken nuggets and tots—will not eat anything else). She doesn’t drink milk, so we supplement with yogurt and cheese. 

Dinnertime, we make one meal only. I refuse to make a separate meal just for her. I do make something she likes once or twice a week (spaghetti—but she only eats the noodles really). I give her fruit with it so she has something to fill her stomach. She also eats veggies pretty well. Her dad thinks she should go hungry. He’s not up late at night with her though (I’m a SAHM) when she’s mad and hungry. 

I really don’t want to make food a war. But it’s difficult when you make a nice dinner and you beg them to just *try* the chicken, *lick* it. Bribery does not work. We’ve tried. Thankfully, her weight doesn’t seem to be dropping. 

She helps us pick out and cook even! But once it’s on her plate it’s shoved away. 

It’s been 3 days. At this point I’m just letting her be.

Hope to god our second isn’t picky.

406,Looking for new/creative/different things to do on weekends with my two boys (9 and 11),"What do you do with your kids on the weekend?

I have shared custody of two boys, ages 9 and 11 and lately I feel like we should be doing more to take advantage of our time together, especially on weekends.

They both have music lessons and martial arts during the week so occasionally we have belt tests or recitals on weekends, but it’s rare. I’m also involved in community service so occasionally I’ll take them with me to volunteer if the work is age appropriate and I think they’d benefit. 


I tried to get them involved in scouts and sports but have been unsuccessful because their mom is unwilling to drive them to activities during her time with them (it’s an argument I no longer engage in). Quite frankly, the local scout troop is also poorly run, so I’m not sure how long we would have stayed with it anyway. 

They’re no longer interested in playing with toys and they’re becoming less interested in Lego, despite having a ton of them and having recently invested in some Lego mindstorms. They will occasionally draw or play tabletop games (chess, go, board games, Pokémon, etc). They may also spend time watching YouTube and playing video games (console and iPad) or making music in GarageBand. 

We have movie night on Fridays and I occasionally wrestle with them or engage in brief nerf battles. I also try to have them help me cook or do DIY tasks around the house but they usually wander off, generally uninterested in using power tools (I’m shocked too!) or doing anything to help that takes more than a minute or two. 

Now that winter is here, we can’t go outside as easily or often to go hiking or play football, basketball, and other things outside.

Jack used to be the sweet boy who hugged all his classmates and teachers, always wanted to help; was great with his hands and loved technology. He would assemble all kind of figurines and paint and detail them.  Loves video games; a little too much.  
Would talk for hours about cars and super engines. The whole 9. In Road trips he would be my co-pilot and we would talk about all kinds of cars we saw. It used to be our favorite pastime.

411,Any advice?,"First time poster here, because I have asked everyone else that I know for advice. My apologies in advance for this being so long. So, I have 5 children and those children have 3 different mothers. My 25, 23, and 17 year old are with wife 1, my 20 year old is with wife 2, and my 5 year old is with wife 3. Please don’t judge me, I was not the best husband at a young age. So, me and my current wife get along great with wife 1 and I have always been there with my children with her. Two have finished college and I helped guide them into great careers and the youngest starts college next August and will be studying in the medical field, so I know he will do great as well. My youngest just started elementary school, but me and her mom are happily married and have been for many years now. 

I come to this sub today because I made a mistake many years ago when my now 20 year old with wife 2 was just 5 years old. She did everything she could to discourage me from seeing our daughter after our divorce. She lied, slapped her own face and called the police on me, refused to let me have my weekends and summer, hid our daughter at her parents house, moved in with her parents so that I would have to deal with her dad when I showed up to see my daughter. I mean she did everything she could to keep us apart. I spent tons of money, had lawyers, got emergency court orders, but finally I just gave up. I didn’t see my daughter from age 5 until she was about 13. She started doing weekends with me and we were starting to form a bond and make up for lost time. Everything was going great and we had a trip to Disney planned that included all the kids (prior to 5 years olds birth) when we abruptly had to cancel. That cancellation caused her to tell me that I never wanted to do anything with her and that she didn’t want anything else to do with me and she disappeared again, refusing to take my calls, return my messages, or see me. Then when she graduated high school, she reached out to me to start talking again. After a few weeks, she began asking about college and how her free college benefit based off my veteran status worked. I explained it to her. Now we never saw each other in person this round because she wanted to “take it slow”. She enrolled in college and sent me the papers to sign to get her 4 years of tuition covered. Once I returned those to her, she blocked my every avenue available to contact her. I was again completely cut off and she only used me to get her tuition covered. 

Recently I moved and changed my phone number and realized that my new number was not blocked. I invited her to come visit us for the holidays with her siblings, at my expense, which she read but ignored. I waited a few days messaged again asking about college, which I hear she quit so she could move in with a guy and try and have a baby, which is fine, she is an adult, but again she read the message and ignored me. I messaged her one last time a few days ago telling her that she now has my number and I wont bother here any more, again ignored. 

My question is when do you give up? I don’t blame her. She was a child and was brainwashed by her mother. I blame me for not continuing the fight for her sake and her mom for filling her head full of whatever is causing this. But at what point is the blame now hers and when do i just throw in the towel and call it quits? I have fully raised 2 successful and educated kids, have another following in their footsteps, and one who is just starting out. I have great relationships with those 4, but for some reason my 20 year old and I cannot find a resolution and I seem to be the only one fighting for us to have some sort of relationship.

422,Disagreements about parenting toddler - help!,"I was a single mom to my toddler until she was just under 2. Started dating my now-fiancé and he moved in 3 months ago. We disagree on parenting approaches. I have been trying the gentle parenting / respectful parenting approach, and he resorts to time outs. I also hate that he doesn’t validate her feelings, going so far as invalidating them (he’s an amazing parent otherwise, so so good with her! It’s just that he says “you’re not sad, there’s no need to cry”)

I have a new job so he’s stepped up in his parenting duties. Tonight he brought up stuff that has apparently been bothering him for awhile. He says that when it’s just him and her, my daughter doesn’t cry or act up. He then told me a bunch of things he thinks I’m doing wrong or ineffectively. So many mixed emotions going on right now…

I’m willing to try the strategies he suggested, but I felt attacked and am angry about the way he approached this. It feels as if he is saying he is the perfect parent, and he wants me to conform to his way of being. Maybe she doesn’t act up as much when it’s just them, but it’s also still a novelty for her, so of course she is on better behaviour. He is now taking that to mean that his way is right and mine is wrong.

424,Do I need to give up on potty training my 3 1/2 year old for awhile?,"A little background- she has an autoimmune disease and gets treatment for it twice a month. This has made her VERY conscious of her bodily autonomy. Right down to the clothes she wears and how her hair is styled. She's been extremely resistant to potty training (there's nothing medically that would prevent her from it).

Last week we made some progress. The first two days were great. She used the toilet all day. However by the 3rd day she was constipated and in pain and after that, just the mention of using the potty had her in tears. At daycare, she was using the potty and they put her in underwear but she was so upset by it that she was barely speaking when I picked her up. Like, lip quivering, ready to cry. I put her back in pull ups.

She's my last kid and I'm so ready to be done with diapers/pull ups but... I need to hold off, right? But for how long?

425,My daughters break my wife,"My daughters (3 and 5) drive my wife insane. They make her life a lot more difficult then for me. At least it seems to me they cry, misbehave or fight a lot more when she is around. My working theory is that my daughter’s behavior is less irritating for me then for my wife and so a) I may experience less stress and a calm intervention may help more than an emotional one and b) my daughters have another strategy to handle me because I am not triggered as easily and maybe because I am the only one strong enough to force my will upon them (like carrying them to the car, not physical punishment). At least the 3 year old also seems very attached to her mother and may also feel a need to “punish” her for not fulfilling her needs. Punishment sometimes seems also to be the motive of the 5 year old. 

I cannot think of an easy solution to change my wife or my daughters. I tried to persuade all to take a different approach, but to no avail.

431,Thoughts of having a 3rd child.,"My wife(35) and I(35) had a mini scare, she was late. We have 2 girls already 14 and 11 and are both amazing in their own way. Wife has been late for a few days and it got me scared and worried. I'm a stay at home dad, taking the girls to and from school, after school programs, play dates, etc. Been like this for the last 8+ years. Wife is a RN and the bread winner and I'm so thankful for that. I've been her number one fan and supporter the 15 years we've been together. Having a 3rd isn't what scared me it was the financial aspect and her well being. She recently has a gastric surgery and has been losing weight and just feeling amazing about all the weight lost, and she reassured me that even with that having a baby wouldn't pose any issues than normal (because she's an RN). I'm not the smartest man and I'm not good with finances like she is so when she tells me not to worry I try not to even though it's hard. 

Sorry for getting off track just a lot on my mind. All day we texted while she was at working talking about what it's. Then we just started saying screw it because she's been consistent with her monthly visitor for the last several months so maybe she was pregnant. My mind was racing all the good and bad things of having a baby at 35 with older children and what not. Like we have the room for another that's not the issue, she wouldn't really have to put her career on hold because I'll be home and with the girls I'm sure they'll help daddy take care of the baby lol. So my mind started thinking of ways the tell the girls and family and friends but still being worried about what to do next...

Well her period was late... it started today while at work. While it was a sigh of relief but now I'm thinking it wasn't. Been thinking about holding that little girl/boy all day, been feeling incomplete for some reason and I can't shake this feeling. There's more to our story but I don't want to bore with all the details of our life.

Not asking for pros or cons of having a third, honestly I don't know what I'm asking, maybe advice, guidance, or just needed to rant and get some outside input from others that have 2 or 3 or more children and hear from your experience.

436,Post Nap Nightmare. Advice welcome!,"For a bit of background, the last 5 months my husband was unemployed. While stressful, it was a great opportunity for him to spend a ton of time with our 2yr old son. The two were best buddies and it was wonderful to see them have so much father son time. Even though I work from home, it was amazing to be all together too.

Last month my husband started his new job, and before his first day we made sure to explain multiple times that things would be changing, and Dad would be working during the day, but not to worry, Dad will always come home.

The first week was fine....then things changed.

Ever since week two our son has woken up from his nap only to immediately fling himself into complete hystericis and wanting absolutely nothing to do with Dad. When asked why he was sad he'd say ""Dad workin."" So we assumed it was just a tough transition, however, things aren't getting better. Every day when he wakes up from his nap he is completely beside himself (we're talkin exorcist level screeching), and every day it lasts about an hour until he's finally settled. During the fit he wants absolutely nothing to do with Dad, and there is nothing Dad can do or say to console him. I have no idea why he's so upset or how to help him, especially since he is completely fine with my husband being around when he wakes up in the morning. Its only after naps.

We've tried everything.
Only me getting him from his nap/comforting him
Only my husband getting him from his nap/comforting him
Both of us getting him

Nothing seems to prevent him from spiraling into hysterics. We keep telling ourselves it's just a phase, but it's heartbreaking to watch my husband try to console our son and equally heartbreaking to hear our son screeching that he doesn't want him, especially since the were inseparable for months.

450,Play Dates & Sleepovers,"My son is about to turn 10 in a couple of weeks. I feel bad that he does not see friends very often outside of school, besides sports practices and birthday parties. No regular play dates and he has not slept over anywhere or had a friend sleep over here. He is very much starting to be interested in these things and I have wanted that for him too, but with how our day to day lives are it is very difficult to arrange. 

Back story: His dad and I have been separated since before he was 2. His dad is recently married and my son has 2 step siblings and a half sibling at dad’s house and they all get along. I have been in a long term relationship for 3.5 years and we live together. Dad and I have shared parenting one week on, one week off M-M. My son has always been in a school district that is not the one I live in, about 25 minutes away. So part of the issue is he does not live near kids he goes to school with, at least not at my house. His dad moved to his current school district about a year ago, but does not arrange things like this either. I live on a busy street, not in a subdivision, so there are no kids he interacts with at my house anyway. My partner and I are also business owners. We don’t have 9-5 jobs. We do have flexibility, but are often working weird hours, need to drop what we’re doing and fix an issue, etc. 

I feel like I am always the one reaching out to others to set things up as is - ie in my own friend group, etc. I’ve told my son he can write my number down to give to his friends, but we haven’t received anything from that, and I don’t know that he’s actually given it to anyone. 

Basically, I don’t know if I should just chill out and let things be the way they are and wait for things to happen naturally? Or push harder to reach out to other parents to set up play dates and sleepovers?",z06nkx,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z06nkx/play_dates_sleepovers/,parenting

I need advice. My 3 year old has been potty trained for a year. Over the past few months I would notice poop on the toilet seat and toilet paper. I figured he just had a hard time cleaning himself, just recently I walked by him in the bathroom to see him playing with his poop as its coming out. He had it all over his hand. I told him that's not okay and not to do that. All his stools have been normal so I know he's not constipated and trying to get it out.

454,How did you all emotionally deal with the transition from 1 to 2?,"So I've just had a second baby, less than a week old. My first is 20 months old and I absolutely love her to death, and I'm struggling to want to do anything for or with my new baby, because i just want to be with my 20 month old instead. I dont want to cuddle or look at my new one,  I'd rather just leave her crying so I can continue to be with the older kid. I know that it takes time to develop a bond with a new child, but that was a lot easier to do with the first because you can focus a lot of time all on the one child, and i actually wanted to do it because it was all new and exciting. Where as now i have to force myself to do the same with my little girl next to us. I know this is probably a very normal emotion to have this early on with a second child but it's emotionally draining to the point of me being too sad to support my wife, which I'm not ok with. It also makes me feel like a bit of a crap dad for not wanting to be around my new baby. Anyone got any tips to try and tip the scales a bit? 

(I guess I should be thankful that the physical side of things is alot more manageable now and is still all natural, so I'm at least half coping..and to be clear, im not neglecting the new bub by any means, still nappy changing, burping, swaddling, cradling, trying to give her lots of kisses, i just really dont feel any joy in doing it)",z02w6f,4,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/z02w6f/how_did_you_all_emotionally_deal_with_the/,parenting
455,"10 month old acting like he’s permanently teething, always screaming and yelling","I heard a lot while I was pregnant that babies don’t just cry for no reason. Well mine certainly seems to. It’s like he can hardly ever just “be” or let us do things. There will be random times in a day he will occupy himself with toys but at least when I’m around he always seems to be crying and wanting attention and just acting miserable. His father gets a lot of quiet play time from him while I’m away at work. 

He usually sees me or decides he’s just done playing and starts *wailing* and whining and usually sticking his finger(s) in his mouth like he’s teething. We give him homeopathic teething tabs or gripe water and that tends to work for a few minutes but that’s all. His first 4 teeth have already come in but he’s had this teething screaming for months and months. Online it says a tooth should only bother a baby for a few days. With him it’s like it’s permanent and never stops. 

He will have eaten his fill, just woken from a nice nap, changed and dry and just wail and act like he’s in pain. It’s not just sad it’s anger. 

Breastfeeding him seems to be the only thing that will quiet him but as he’s already full he only latches for a few seconds before popping off and yelling at me and shoving his finger in his mouth and screaming at me.

I see other babies his age just chill and content to watch and observe. He seems to get bored so quickly even with toys. Taking him to a restaurant is guaranteed to have him yelling and flipping within 10 minutes. Curious George is the only thing that distracts him but obviously I don’t want that as a crutch.

That has her pressing up against the bars to pass out on our hands and only lasts an hour or so before she wakes and cries some more. 
One of us sleeps on the couch with her on our chest while the other sleeps in bed. This has been going on since 6 months. Before that, we could set her down after she fell asleep and she'd sleep until 2 am when she wakes up and wants to be held again. Which happens every night. My husband doesn't want to try co sleeping in our bed because of the risk of SIDS to her. I'll admit. That males me nervous too.
I don't know what to do at this point. This is our one and only child and I don't want to hamper her growth or skills like self soothing. But on the other hand, I can't take her crying so much when we put her in the crib. It kills me. 
I just don't know the best way to get her to sleep on her own without creating damage. My big worry about cry it out is that she'll feel alone and unloved. (Grew up with emotionally abusive mother,and felt like that constantly)

And seeing the aftermath of it, the blood, the pain when something hit my wrist... reminded me I was alive...


I was at work and got a call from my kids therapist telling me that they were self harming... and that kiddo was afraid to tell me , not for repercussions of said actions but because kiddo didn't want what was hurting them to then hurt me....
When I heard this I bawled my eyes out because I just want em to be happy and I know I can't make life all sunshine and rainbows for her... but it never crossed my mind that they would be in a position where they felt cutting was the solution.
I feel terribly guilty.
Like by me being so open with the struggles I had as a teen gave her the idea to try the same coping mechanism I used, when that was never my point... it was always to be cautious and aware that it's a slippery slope... 

When I got off work I told kiddo that I talked with their therapist... and that I'm sorry they didn't feel comfortable enough to come to me or even tell me they did it... that I'm not upset at her... I get it. But if there is anything I could do to lessen the burdens resting on their shoulders...

471,Can't even get him to poop in the bathroom,"I find it really hard to keep the patience about potty training.

My 3yo toddler is systematically and stubbornly refusing to poop in the potty.

If I ask him where he should poop he says in the loo. He even sits there happily but won't go.

As soon as I put a nappy on at the right time (about 2pm, his nap time), he'll close his door, stand on his bed and poop there. The whole process takes about 30 seconds but the poop comes out in lightning speed and I can never catch him exactly at that second. If I open the door before nothing is in, and if I let it pass it is too late. In the latter case I get him to empty the nappy in the toilet, he finds that very fun but his behavior is absolutely not changed by it.

If I read the tricks on the Internet the next trick is to take him so he poops in his nappies but in the bathroom rather than on his bed. However I tried and he simply withholds poop up until I put him back in the room, he closes the door and just keeps pooping like that.

I regularly read that the first step is to disrupt the association between his room and pooping but this in his specific case also means disrupting afternoon nap routine...

I try to keep a straight face, to be nice and patient with him to avoid constipation but this is getting me nuts. I have been stuck since 3 months at that stage. We tried bribe (worked for putting him on the loo and also worked for peeing), we tried simply stopping nappies (worked for peeing but he will simply withhold poop until constipation risk increases).

474,"11mo lagging behind on transition to solids, help.","Hi parents, first time dad here looking for help with transitioning my 10mo old daughter to solids. She's such a great kid, developing well, fun to be around, and a bundle of joy, but I feel like her feeding development has been a bit slow lately, and was wondering if someone had some good advice for me here?

She currently is on 2 naps a day, feeds with three 7-8oz bottles of formula (fed right when waking up from sleep or naps) and supplement it with 1-3 fruity / savoury puree pouches (100-125ml ea) about 2h after her milk. She has no physical problem sucking on her pouches or being spoon fed their contents, however she always fights us when we feed us the savoury stuff and we often have to give in to feeding her yogurt or conceal her savoury stuff under a layer of yogurt on her spoon. She really struggles with textures and anything lumpy and just ejects them from her mouth with her tongue.

We tried to do some baby led weaning for some time, but because of our busy lifestyle, and we had to travel a lot without a decent set up for the mess it creates, we had to abort and continued with spoon feeding. We still do about 1 meal a day where, after feeding her, we drop some finger foods on her table that she picks up, brings to mouth, and nibbles on slightly, but none of it actually makes it down. No proper chewing or swallowing.

Everywhere I read it feels like 11 month olds should be able to cope with textures and finger foods. Some say she should be able to self feed with a spoon. 

I guess my questions are : 
- what do you think would be the best way for me to progress with textures, and solid chunks?
- should I stop giving on to the yogurt? Am I just training her to be a demanding picky eater?
- should I be training her to use her own spoon now?
- any other advice?

Thanks everyone for your help. Happy to provide more details.

A little over two years ago he got promoted and went to nights again (he was on nights for about 2 years when he started with the company right after our 1st was born). There are systems in place for him to move back to days but they've been on hold with covid and other various plant happenings. We've been getting by emotionally for a while but he's really hit a wall of depression here recently and I just don't know how to help him through. Week days he comes home from work and helps me get the kids off to school, sleeps when we're all gone, wakes up when we all get home, eats an early dinner and leaves. He has about all told 3hrs where he sees any of us and maybe a little bit of time to himself to relax or do chores if there's not overtime in the morning. Saturday he tries to be up no later than 2pm and tries to go to bed ""early"" Saturday night to be up by noon or so on Sunday. I try to keep up on laundry and dishes so there's not so much to do on the weekends and we can spend time together but having the kids in the evenings to run various activities/errands I don't always stay on top of things (and I need personal time too sometimes).

He has had a hard time recently connecting with folks at work (even ones he knows he gets along with /has similar interests) because they are either younger and staying out partying/drinking all night is still cool or they are older/divorced and sleeping around and always talking about their date life and other things he can't relate to (this is me paraphrasing some of his recent rants). The friends we used to see all the time on days (we had a weekly d&d game running consistently for almost 3 years) still play without us and get together for events that he can't join which makes him bitter and isolate. He tried to start gaming with some other late crew and it fell apart after one session.

I just don't know how to help him. I make suggestions and he'll make excuses and I know if he just got through the mental block and did things he'd realize he can make time and space for the things he enjoys in a new way.

478,My co-parent paints me as a neglectful parent...,"My ex came over to drop our daughter off to me. He had her all bundled up even though she had a fever of 103. I didn't question it, but stated we should strip her down. I stated that in the winter, he doesn't HAVE to put her coat back on her after taking her out of the car and bringing her into the warm house. It takes 30 seconds to get to and from the car to the house. When I said I don't always put her coat back on her if we don't have time, he said that that was child abuse. I'm car seat trained for work and it literally states it in our training that it's okay if they are just going from car to building. He yelled and swore at me all while holding our daughter. I try and remain as calm as I can because if I raise my voice even a little, he raises his more. I asked him to stop talking to me like that while he was holding our daughter. 

Then, I asked if he could take the battery out of the thermometer and get us a new one because he was going to the grocery store anyways. He started looking for a screwdriver. At this point, my daughter who is 2, took an egg out of the fridge for me to cook. She was holding it in her hand I said I brb I'll go grab a screw driver. Well, he freaked at me and said she was going to get salmonella if I let her walk around with a grocery store-bought egg. It's not something I do regularly but I was distracted by getting the screwdriver for him. He said I was incompetent. I said we always wash our hands when we are done and that it's no big deal and he brought her to the sink and started washing her hands and said ""at least one of us knows how to parent"". 

After I came up with the tool, I tried to open the thermometer but couldn't so I asked him to do it. He got it and then said "" I don't know why you couldn't do that yourself"" like as if I didn't try? i don't know? just couldn't get it? he can do everything better than I can according to him and I should be able to do the simplest of things as if he never has any trouble doing anything because he's sooo perfect. and yet I hold my tongue. 

He then proceeded to tell me she never wants to come to my house. He said when he tells her it's time to go to mom's, she screams and cries and says ""no, daddy's house"". Follwed by that that makes him think I'm hurting her. I wouldn't dream of it in a million years but he said because I have my own thoughts of self-harming that he is worried I would hurt her. I haven't had self-harm thoughts in a long time and I would NEVER hurt my daughter. I think I even have maybe raised my voice a little at her maybe twice in her life let alone do anything physical to hurt her. 

He also told me he has raised her since she was born (we have been 50/50 since she was 7 months) so no he hasn't. He may have more physical time with her because on the days he has her, he's not usually working but for me, I'm in school so she needs to go to daycare when I have her. I spend as much time with her as I possibly can. He also told me he babies her and that she only JUST started holding her own bottle because she always wanted him to do it. She has been holding her own bottle at my house for over a year. I'm not saying either one of us is better than the other, I just want to be partners in this but he makes it impossible because in his eyes, everything I do is wrong. And that's what our marriage was like too. I couldn't do anything right in his eyes. I'm exhausted. We are no contact and have been but I gave him an inch and he took a mile so now we are back to completely no contact, text only and hi and bye at pick up and drop off.

While I never stopped loving them or had any strong disagreement, it hurt a little that the name his dad and i spent months picking out was no longer an option (it is a male name) I was never not going to love them and decided whatever name they wanted me to call them was wonderful as long as they wanted me to call them. They had come out as bisexual a cpl years previously. I told them I don't care who you love as long as they make you happy and are a good partner. My child brought over their first partner. I suspected trans as he had a smaller stature, this was later confirmed, but I adore him. He is smart, witty, doesn't take shit, stands up to my strong willed twins. I love him almost as if he was my own. The only problem is, he was born she. That I do not care about. But, he is smaller in stature, and ever since it was confirmed he was born a she ( not through poking, asking, or intruding , it came up bc I was uncomfortable buying my youngest son harry potter books) bc I don't want support non trans supporting community. The problem is My brain defaults to him as a her, even though I have never known him as a her.

483,Am I making a mountain out of a molehill here??,"My husband & I are a blended family with 4 boys, all in their teens. The youngest is my biological son, the older 3 are his. The twins, who turn 17 in just a couple months, recently got their drivers licenses. We can’t afford the increase in our car insurance to add them to the policy, and they can’t afford to pay for it themselves, as neither of them are employed. 

I found out yesterday that my husband recently let one of them drive his (my husband’s) car to go pick up some friends. I only found this out because said teen asked me last night if he could go pick up some friends and I said no because he’s not insured. He kept pushing about it, with one of his points being ‘but dad let me take his car to pick up friends before!’

My husband ‘doesn’t think it’s a big deal’, but from my understanding, being caught driving without insurance is not only illegal, but can lead to hefty fines, and possibly even a suspension of their license, as well. Am I crazy?? I’m getting real sick of being made out to be the bad guy just for exercising common sense and basic prudence, while dad gets to be the ‘cool parent’ because he says yes to nearly everything, without considering the implications/possible consequences.

484,Request: Sleep training a difficult 18 m/o,"Hey gang, so we're in a bit of a pickle

Our second child has always been difficult to get to sleep, right from when we were starting to sleep train her. She has a medical condition which means she spews very easily. One of the ways this manifests is when we try to get her to sleep - she gets so upset she throws up. Fast. Really, really fast. In as little as 30 seconds of being alone fast. After 4 months or so of being spewed on and changing sheets, we gave up and have been getting her to sleep by lying down with her. We were regularly running out of clothes for her, me and my wife, plus all our towels and sheets being soiled in a single night. Even with us lying next to her,  she is still pretty prone to getting upset and spewing fairly regularly. We went through the route of dieticians etc which did identify some allergies, and her medical condition.

Anyway fastfoward to now: were expecting child number 3 in a few months. Child number 2 (18 months)  is better at not spewing, but still needs one of us to lie down with her to get her to sleep. This obviously needs to change and the sooner the  better. With the medical help we've had, she's less prone to spewing, and we think she's probably ready to start sleep training again, but we're very nervous to start. We successfully used a (gentle) cry it out method with her older sibling, who is now a great sleeper. We've talked about going to a sleep consultant, but they're crazy expensive here so we thought we'd pick the minds of reddit for ideas

Has anyone had similar experience? Got advice or resources worth checking out?

Background: I work full time 8.5 hours 5 days a week. My husband works 12 hour shifts 2 days on 2 days off. Husband and I alternate weekends off to be with our daughter. She is our only at the moment.

My husband and I are fighting over parenting duties. My daughter almost 3 years old has been on a mommy kick which seems like forever. If we are both home she will only want me to change diapers, read stories, bath, bedtime, ect.

Last night I think I reached a point where I snapped. I come home later than normal (had an errand to run) and I dont get even 5 minutes to decompress from work also he hasnt even fed her dinner yet. I asked him several times to read her a bedtime story so I could have a few minutes. That was unsuccessful. Husband told me that she only wants me. He doesn't want to read to her when she crying and screaming. I told him I need a few minutes to myself. He like she be in bed in 5 minutes so you can have all your me time you want. I yelled that's not fair, I wake up in mommy mode get her ready for daycare, drop her off and go to work, come home and spend the next 2 hours feeding, playing and bedtime routine. 
12 hours of no down time/me time other than the breaks I took at work. He did get her out of bed in the am (after I texted him to from the shower) and changed her diaper and he picked her up from daycare, that all the parenting duties he did yestersay. 

Husband told me she just going through mommy phase and I just need to wait it out. I said we'll your not helping sitting on the side lines waiting for her to want you. It doesn't work that way. You need to just take her and read her a story whether or not she wants you to or not. 

He told me I'm ruining our relationship because I'm taking my frustrations out on him because my daughter only wants me. He says it's not his fault she doesn't want him. I said being in mommy/work mode 12 hours a day is ruining my mental wellbeing. He says she is fine with him when I'm not around. 

All I want is 50/50 parenting duties. I know on days he works I have to do it all because he is gone before she wakes up and is home for the last 15 min of bedtime.

My thoughts right now is that we’ll have about a month between getting the present and the show(I want the present to be a surprise for my husband be he lives Hamilton) so maybe we have a “practice night” once a week till the show?

I’m really not sure how it’ll work out. I don’t want her screaming herself to sleep that night but I also don’t want to miss this show(the night show was the only one available when my mom got the tickets, they went fast!)

So any advice would be greatly appreciated, especially if you went through this with your toddler to!

Also, I feel I should mention this my daughter is developmently delayed. She can’t talk yet and I do not she’s mentally where most children her age are. I think she probably acts a bit more similar to a one year old so I think that could possibly affect the advice.

505,Today and turn babies and cribs,"TYPO LOL “TOSSY AND TURNY BABIES”

EDIT: I’m not trying to move my baby into his own room RIGHT now, looking for other parents of babies so move a lot in their sleep and asking how you got them safely sleeping in a crib

Alright. My son is 8mo, he sleeps in a bedside pack and play type situation where the bedside is open so I can sooth and halfway snuggle (but in a safe way).

My dude is a move ever since he was in my stomach - The nurses would ALWAYS comment when finding his heartbeat on how much he was moving. It’s still true for my guy he ends up sideways, on his tummy, diagonal, on his side basically every which way from bed time to morning. 

Here’s my question: our crib has the usual plank like open sides, how do I put him to sleep there-in his own room- knowing he moves around so much? Like I’m worried about a hand or leg going through the wood planks, or a head ending up smooshed against one of them by morning. 

Has anyone else had a baby who moves a lot during sleep? What did you do to get them sleeping in a crib/their own room?",yzwrn7,0,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yzwrn7/today_and_turn_babies_and_cribs/,parenting
506,Challenges falling asleep (5yo),"5yo used to be a going to sleep champ. Recently she's been more demanding with bedtime asks (""another story!"" ""A scary story!"" ""You told it wrong!"") but also decides she can't sleep and says ""I can't fall asleep"" every 30s. When I offer to sing (which usually does the trick) she declines and is generally resistant to my advice (think about sheep, get your arms under the covers, take deep breaths).

Tonight we got pretty frustrated with each other and I feel bad, but I just don't know what to do, especially when she is so grumpy and resistant to me trying to help.

508,I gained custody of my nephew who was neglected and he refuses to eat,"My nephew’s (M1) mom (F25) and dad (M24) are both severe meth addicts and due to a call to CPS, I was able to gain custody of him. His parents had been both on meth all throughout the pregnancy until the last couple months, and then continued after he was born. They smoked around him constantly, and never showed him any affection. Now that I have complete guardianship of him, I can really see the damage that they inflicted. They never fed him regular food, only milk in a bottle, and now he refuses to eat anything and only wants a bottle of milk. Sometimes without any apparent reason, he will start screaming and throwing things. He just recently began walking, and the only sounds he makes are hums or screams or growls. I’m more worried about the food situation, he looks malnourished and will cry and throw a fit whenever I try giving him food. I’m new to parenting and I have no idea what to do.

509,I think I might be starting to resent my daughter because my new son trusts her more,"Okay so I have a daughter who’s 24 and I adopted an autistic son recently who’s 15. We’ve been doing our best to give him a good home and family and I’ve been being the best mom I can for him, but he’s really really latched on to my daughter more so than me. Like he feels more safe around her and will talk to her much more than he talks to me, and there have been times he’s been scared I’ll yell at him over a poor test score or a spilled container of food (he has PTSD from his bio mom, long story) so he’ll go to her. He also told her about a girl at school he had a crush on and that started to make me a bit jealous, but this morning was the straw that broke the camel’s back for me. He has problems with nightmares and nighttime PTSD, and I told him he could always wake me up if he was struggling or having a hard time. However, this morning I found out he was having a hard time and he woke up my daughter instead of me.

I know I might be taking this too personally, but I feel really hurt that he’s not connecting with me in the same way he does her. I’m also having a hard time not being upset with my daughter and I feel I have to try to stop myself from feeling upset/angry with her. I want him to feel safe and it’s great he has a connection with someone who he trusts. However, I just really wish he had that connection with me too.

510,My 9 months old son was accepted for early intervention.,"Hello everyone, I'm a little lost, very anxious and to be honest very worried and probably on the verge of a breakdown. We noticed something was off about our son when he was about 5 months old. Had a few strange eye movements and a shaky demeanor. We thought it was seizures so we took him to a neurologist. They did a CAT scan and an EEG and everything came out normal. The pediatrician and the neurologist both told us to come back around 8 months. But by 8 months old, he stopped rolling over from front to back or back to front. It's almost like he forgot how to. He has a very difficult time tracking objects or making eye contact. We had his eyes tested and he is nearsighted so we got him glasses and eye contact got better but he's not able to grasp an object unless you put it in his hand. He won't reach for anything, he can't sit up on his own or roll over. We finally had our evaluation for early intervention and they gave us a call back today to let us know that his scores were somewhere between a two and a 3-month-old. I'm completely crushed. And I also feel extremely alone. Is there anyone out there that's been through this that can shed some light on at least your outcome?",yyztau,176,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yyztau/my_9_months_old_son_was_accepted_for_early/,parenting
511,8y/o: How to deal with social anxiety?,"Hi, how can I help my son become more comfortable with himself and being around others? His teacher described him as ""immature for his age."" He's very uptight and rigid, e.g. absolutely terrified of breaking rules. He tends to carry his body in a very tight manner, never really looking very relaxed. 

He also doesn't like being called out--he recently stopped playing four square because he doesn't like the conflict of people telling him he's out (when he doesn't think so). Most kids would just argue back.

I absolutely cannot find a therapy service that isn't insanely expensive or heavily waitlisted (usually, both). Are there any recommendations for online behavior health therapists?

One example, I bought this ""Little Talk"" card game and one question ""What's an emotion you have trouble expressing?"" (not verbatim). The answer was surprising: He said that he finds it really embarrassing when everyone is cheering for him, and even got a little weepy.

I'm surprised. I wasn't the most social kid growing up, I have ADHD and social anxiety. But I don't recall being out of it. He also doesn't seem to have ADHD symptoms, he seems to be good at multi-tasking and focusing.

How can I get my son to warm up around people? I feel like there's a window that's closing and I need to intervene to get him to keep up with his age group, socially.",yzqqw5,2,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yzqqw5/8yo_how_to_deal_with_social_anxiety/,parenting
512,Vindictive pooping,"My 2 year old has been in the process of potty training for a few months now. She seemed ready, but she has a lot of issues with poop that have complicated things. She goes pee no issue. Occasional if she is playing and doesn't want to miss out she might leak a little, but it isn't often. Poop is a whole nother ball game. For a while she was scared of her poop. Totally normal and I expect it. We worked through it and were doing a lot better. Then she fell in the toilet while trying to go at the sitter's house and we had to start over. Got better for a while then baby sister was born. Got better and went two weeks without an accident of any sort, the longest ever. Then randomly last week and she is back to pooping herself. I'll put her on the potty, she'll pee, say she's all done, then poop herself a few minutes later. Or any time I leave her she'll poop herself even if she went right before I left. I was gone maybe an hour and a half the other day and, despite going before, she pooped herself twice in that time. 


I can't help but feel like she is doing it on purpose to get attention. She is very attached to me and gets flustered if I can't give her attention all the time. Even with the new baby I make sure I'm giving her quality 1 on 1 time for at least an hour every day while baby sleeps. Outside that time we still are together and playing I just can't always do what she wants because I have to nurse. But if she poops herself I have to stop and tend to her.

513,Mom friends when kids are fighting,"I'm wondering how you all handle conflicts between kids when you're friends with the kid's mom (or dad)?  My daughter is 8 and has had this friend for a few years now.  

Myself and this friend's mom have gone from just friendly acquaintances to actually being friends ourselves over the last couple of years and it's been nice to hang out with her while our kids are playing.  Lately, the girls have been bickering a lot more, they're in the same class this year so might be just too much time spent together.  

About a month ago, my friend approached me about some things that my daughter was doing that was upsetting hers.  It's nothing major, just typical 8-year-old girl behavior.  I said I would talk to her about it, but she just kept going, almost like she was ranting about some other kid, and not ranting TO me about my own child.  Overall my daughter is a very good kid, but she can of course be a brat sometimes.  I own that, and it's my job as her parent to help guide her and correct unfavorable behavior, but when I mentioned a similar thing that I witnessed her daughter do (not to point fingers but to illustrate how this behavior is common at this age), she said no, her daughter's not like that.  It really bugged me, but I decided to let it go.  

Since then we've tried to schedule two playdates, but both got canceled by her (legit reasons, not excuses).  The first time my daughter was sad, a few tears fell but she didn't throw a tantrum or anything. Her daughter was also very visibly sad and kept asking why they couldn't play.

When she canceled the second time, she explained why (over text) and said ""I know your daughter will be mad, but it is what it is.""  That really struck a nerve with me.  My daughter wasn't mad, she was understandably sad that she didn't get to do something that she'd been looking forward to, as was her friend.  I will never tell my daughter that her emotions are not correct, especially when her behavior/reaction was not inappropriate.  I haven't responded to that text because I couldn't ignore what she said, and I was afraid anything I said when I was mad would end our friendship and possibly our daughters' as well.

If that happens, it's unfortunate, but so be it.  I'm just not sure what to do.  Should I tell her what she has said bothered me and see if there is a chance she will take it well and things will be fine, or is it pretty obvious our friendship is doomed and just let it be?   I am sure this will not be the last time our kids have issues....all friendships, especially as kids, go through ups and downs, and they may even grow apart and not be friends anymore at some point and that's ok.  But if she's already acting as though her daughter can do no wrong, I can't see how any future issues will go any differently.",yzpyvy,2,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yzpyvy/mom_friends_when_kids_are_fighting/,parenting
514,Very Low. Looking For Help,"FYI I’m cross posting this from r/daddit as I am desperate for some kind and encouraging words.

So I have been really struggling the last couple of months. Very badly. As a quick background, I’m a lawyer and generally overworked and stressed out. I day dream about owning a business or running a restaurant or being a musician, but law is the career I chose and I feel I’ll be stuck in it for ever. Luckily the place I work is good people.  But the job itself is such a grind I feel beat down.

But in addition to that grind, I also lost my dog of 11 years back in July and I don’t think the grief really hit me until a couple of months ago and I have been inconsolable over it recently, crying more than I can remember.

There are also a ton of other issues I’ve been going through including excessive drinking and other unhealthy coping, I’m at my heaviest weight I’ve ever been. I’ve feeling undesired and somewhat resented by my fiancee (who is in all honesty perfect). My fiancée recently took a job that has been abusive to her and has her working crazy hours which puts a lot of stress on all of us and keeps her away from our (nursing) baby. 

Getting to my son. My son is 5 months old and he is incredible and my fiancée is the perfect mother. She is confident, strong and knows exactly what to do and is the baby whisperer. The other night I set him down on the sofa (stupid of me) and turned around for a second to get his seat and I see him roll and slide off the sofa, fall onto his back and the back of his head bumped the floor (which thankfully had thick carpeting)

He cried for a minute but was generally unhurt. Literally no bump or bruise, no swelling, no vomiting or loss of consciousness or anything. We called the on call doctor that night who said to monitor him. We also brought him to the doctor in person who examined him and said his head looks perfectly healthy and there was no need for an MRI. He acts no different than before.

I on the other hand feel completely traumatized and am replaying the fall in my head over and over. Everytime it causes me panic and grief and shame. But the worst part is my ocd which is not allowing me to believe my son is fine, I think he will have some delay down the road or some other deficiency because of this despite no evidence. I am obsessing to the point of violent panic attacks and uncontrollable sobbing and feelings of worthlessness and that I don’t deserve to be a parent.

With this on top of everything I have already been dealing with I have felt multiple instances of suicidal ideation, even thinking my fiancée and son would be better off without me. I feel totally broken no matter how many people tell me my son is okay and everything will pass.

I’m restarting therapy but I needed to pour my heart out to this sub. Not sure what I’m hoping to get from it. Maybe just some kind words of encouragement.",yzua4d,1,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yzua4d/very_low_looking_for_help/,parenting

527,Our 3wk newborn daughter was just diagnosed and admitted to the ER with RSV,"Our 3wk old daughter was diagnosed with RSV today, just admitted to the ER

We have two girls; a 4yo and our newborn 3wks old. 4yo had a nasty cold she brought home from preschool last week and her symptoms lasted around 8 days. We kept the girls separated and all wore masks inside, hoping to avoid contact with our newborn. 

Three days ago we noticed our newborn starting to sniffle a little bit - not panicked yet, started propping her up in her Basinet and using a cool mist humidifier. 

Over the next two days - Symptoms gradually turned into fully stuffed nose and a cough here and there. Nights were the worst, she’d fuss anytime her nose was a little stuffy as we did our best to suck the boogs out with saline & the nose freida. 

Middle of the night last night, she was having the toughest time yet. Coughing more frequently, rapid heavy breathing (more than 60 breaths/minute), nose flare, completely stuffed beyond control. We decided to go to the ER at 3am. (Fortunately our 4yo also had recovered by this point and is staying with her grandma so we can care for littlest one).

We were well aware of RSV and hoping it wasn’t that - but a rapid test confirmed once we got here. 

They immediately helped with her stuffed nose using their mega-nose-freida. We’ll be staying here the next couple days to continue monitoring, but feeling optimist that we came at the right time. So far no fever, oxygen levels are normal, she’s just having a really tough uncomfortable time. 

Sharing this in case anyone is worrying about RSV or seeing similar symptoms in their children. It’s very scary to see our 3wk old struggling this much so early on….but you can be vigilant, and help is out there. We were kind of “should we go?” Before ultimately going to the ER today, and very glad we did.

 I won’t go into detail, but I’ll say that she trusted me without question though the process, even with a caveat or two in her attempts. She wanted me to stay with her.  She whispered to me during our mom and me tennis lesson, “Mom, this is SO much better than pads”.

I’m beginning to wonder if it’s me, and these things are totally normal or is there genuinely something wrong here that needs to change or else the kids will suffer as they grow into adulthood. 

1) Because of the secrecy she dealt with from her ex, she doesn’t want the kids to feel she’s being secretive with them; She allows the kids (mostly it’s her daughter) free access to her phone, doesn’t shut her bedroom door and allows the kids to open mail/packages addressed to her. Her daughter has intercepted texts from me, and not only read them, but didn’t tell her about them. I’ve tried to explain to her the difference between secrecy and privacy and how she, AND the kids, deserve a level of privacy. Is this abnormal? Is it unhealthy short, and long, term for the kids?

2) We’re unable to talk on the phone, at all, whenever she has the kids (2/3 of the month) - Her son wants her to be happy but her daughter throws a fit whenever she has tried to talk to me: she once went outside to talk to me and ended up locked out of the house by the daughter, who refused to let her back in. Other times, she has just spewed vile, disrespectful, mean things at my GF. I understand that we don’t want to rush the f2f introduction to them, but the way she’s acting is totally inappropriate and should be reprimanded, else it will continue and likely get worse. Is this normal (the way she’s allowing her daughter to “rule the roost” and behave)? What are the long-term implications of allowing this to continue?

3) The 12 y/o frequently (more than half the time) sleeps in bed with my GF. She has her own room and bed, and isn’t coming to her in the middle of the night out of fear of the Boogie Man or anything…she just chooses to sleep there. Again, is this normal and what kind of detrimental effects, if any, could this have?

530,Vetch pro baby monitor cameras accessed by someone unknown- has this happened to anyone?,"Has anyone else experienced this and what did you do with the monitors? 

Background 

I have two cameras and live in a two roomed attic, the cameras sat just 6 feet from each other, one in my room(cam 1)-one in the kids room(cam 2).  When I got them I turned the blue light on for 2 as a night light and that stayed like that until one day I went to peek the cameras and had no access to 2, fiddled, followed instructions, couldn’t connect. I decided when I could get into the cam I’d turn the light off. I got in about a week later, off goes the light. 

2 is still on and 1 has never done anything “weird” so I leave everything alone, occasionally try to check 2 but it again doesn’t allow me to connect. I turn it off, unplug, then boot it back up, I get in to the camera for 2 minutes, it pauses, then disconnects. I fiddle with my wifi settings, nothing changes, the night light for 2 is still off.   

About 2 weeks ago I wake up to feed my infant for his 2am feed, i dreamily see gradient lighting coming from the boys room- then it clicks to me, someone’s controlling the camera. I wake up dad and ask when the last time he accessed 2 was, he says he’s never ever been able to, I cry and beg him to turn the camera off. 

We get into 2 about 4 days later and turn the light off. Dad aims the camera basically at the floor and towards the door of their room “if anyones looking they’ll obviously move the camera- they don’t want to look at nothing” 

Well it fucking happened. I was getting dressed and as I pulled my shorts up I looked over and the blue fucking light was shining as bright as ever and the camera was pointed right at me.  I sobbed and called my mom to come take them down because my LO was nursing and having a hard time calming as it was.  I can’t shake the feeling that someone’s “in” my room. 

Has anyone else experienced something like this? What did you do with the cameras?",yzsd8u,0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yzsd8u/vetch_pro_baby_monitor_cameras_accessed_by/,parenting
531,My 6 Year old has untrue negative thoughts,"My 6 year old has so many untrue negative thoughts. We are a positive growth mindset household. We don’t talk negatively about our bodies etc. My other daughter is 2 years older and gives out compliments and is happy go lucky. We started noticing negativity at 4 when she wouldn’t wear shorts. Eventually we got it out of her that she doesn’t like her legs. She thinks they are too skinny. Tried to talk her out of it, she will wear swimsuits but not shorts. I babysit another child who is the same body type as my daughter and super body confident. My other daughter is curvy and also body confident. 
She won’t wear hats because she thinks she looks bad in hats. This is all during pandemic times so she was at home and not hearing this from anyone.
Recently at school she says she has no friends. I talked with her teacher and she never plays by herself, the other kids ask her to play. 
A friend invited her for a play date recently, her mom said she’s been talking about my daughter all the time and what good friends they are. When I told my daughter she said why would she want me she never talks to me or plays with me or anything.
She is ridiculously creative, she would tell stories from age 3 about how she built our town before she was “dead in the ground”. She’s also hilarious and can pull one liners out of thin air. She called me “glasses” the other day.
I’ve always been somewhat worried about the future for her because there seems to be a relationship between creative funny people and depression. Im thinking of bringing this up with the school social worker but I know there’s other kids she sees with major issues and she is perfect at school. She told me she’s good at school because it’s in public and she’ll never be bad in public.
Sigh today she told me she hates us and we all hate her.",yzrvia,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yzrvia/my_6_year_old_has_untrue_negative_thoughts/,parenting

533,My sister is pregnant and wants a relationship,"As the title says, my sister is pregnant and seems to want a relationship with me even though she hasn’t directly told me this. 

To keep this short, my sister is the type of person who you can never count on being there for you and is not responsible. If it’s the worse choice, she’ll choose it. She also is the type to disappear from not just me but our family in general for months on end and blames it on depression/and her struggles in life. She had took advantage of me financially a few years back without batting an eye at the time, my birthday came and went this year without any acknowledgment on her end, and I also was recently engaged last year and pregnant earlier this year. She was no where to be found my entire pregnancy and even after the birth of my child she still has not even gave me as much as a congratulations, just dead silence. I’m sure her excuse is yet again, depression or stress.

Well, literally the day after I got cleared at my 6 week postpartum appointment, i get a call from our mutual relatives that she decided to appear again and announced that she’s now pregnant. She also goes on to say that she hopes our children can be friends because they’ll be close in age and that she hopes it will bring us closer together mind you she still hasn’t contacted me personally about this or heard from her in general. She sounds delusional to me.

Our one mutual relative thinks I should just be the bigger person and reach out or at least be open to a relationship with her. My thing is that she’s hurt me so much at this point that I’ve now disconnected myself from her emotionally as I don’t trust her. She only comes around when she needs something and in this case probably emotional support and possible handouts for her child down the line which I would have no problem doing if she knew how to treat people. I also now worry about her unborn child because she can’t even make good choices for herself. Not to mention the resentment I have for her not even bothering to acknowledge my child let alone my pregnancy/child birth. 

Overall I feel like she robbed me of the excitement/joy of her being pregnant and our children knowing each other because of this mess she’s created between us.

539,3 year old vomiting every 2-4 days in the middle of the night for a month,"My daughter has been vomiting in the middle of the night for one month. It usually happens between 2-4am.  She will wake up crying. Go to the toilet and vomit twice.  We will cuddle for 30ish minutes and then she usually vomits twice again, and then goes back to bed. She has no fever. This has been going on for 29 days and happens every 2-4 days.  Whenever this happens she wakes up fine the next day. Her energy is fine. Appetite is fine.  We've been to the pediatrician and are awaiting two specialist appointments (gastro this week and opthamologist in February).  She's been tested for a UTI and parasites (negative). They didn't catch any issues with her ears or breathing.  She does fall a lot (balance issues), but she has always been this way.  She also crosses her eyes a lot recently, but it's always in the context of her laughing or being silly.  The pediatrician also used a machine to run some test on her eyes and everything came back normal (pediatrician also observed the eye crossing).  When this all started she did have some diarrhea for about a day, but that stopped after 24 hours and now has just been the vomiting in the middle of the night.  We've been keeping a food journal and can't find anything specific. She eats very little dairy (doesn't drink milk and doesn't like cheese).  We thought it might be post nasal drip and were doing children's Zyrtec and steam baths, and nasal rinse but that hasn't seemed to help and there's no other evidence of a cold.

Telling grandma bed by 11pm seems like a good compromise. For the food, I’m just going to ignore. Talked to kiddo about eating other things and we’ll see how it goes.

Kiddo is 6 and spends the night or weekend at grandma’s house once a month. I know it’s typical for grandparents to spoil the kids but it’s 1am and my kid is awake in bed, eating snacks, watching slime videos on YouTube. Do you turn a blind eye? Ask them to follow loose guidelines? Stick to the rules of your home? 

Specifics: Grandma is my MIL and she’s a nice lady but we have 100% opposite personalities. We live very close so we interact a lot. Because of this I just bite my tongue and let my husband figure stuff out when she has our kid. I can’t tell if my annoyance is grandparent-related or MIL-related, if that makes sense.

Then afterwards, in the new place, he started coming to my bed more often, nearly every night, in the middle of the night, but it was still manageable. Then the war in Ukraine started and we ended up hosting a Ukrainian refugee who had nowhere to go, for 6 months. She slept in my son’s room, and he slept with me.

I’ve tried talking to him, tried positive reinforcement, maintaining a routine, tried a night light and an open door, nothing works. He does fall asleep once he calms down, but to get him to go to his bed is a struggle every single time.

547,I'm at a loss of what to do,"My oldest has ADHD. She also has disruptive mood disregulation disorder, she has to be evaluated by a neuropsychologist and is suspected to have conduct disorder (for those who don't know, it's basically the Beginning of antisocial disorder which is different than being asocial). She has therapy twice a month, she sees a behavioral coach weekly, she's on mood stabilizers, she gets med checks monthly. She does an after school program by her own choice and she loves it. 
I encourage her to do what she's focused on, if it's art, exercise, writing, you name it. I reward good behavior, discourage bad. I try to involve her in things, let her choose what she wants to do, help make decisions for dinner, and so on. 
She's in 2nd grade, she can tell you what healthy coping skills are. She knows what's good and what's bad. What she should do and what she doesn't do. She gets praised by her teachers, speech therapist, everyone. But at home she's nothing like they say.
""Can you please pick up your papers?"" And she screams. 
""Please leave your brother alone, he doesn't want to play"" more screaming.
It doesn't matter what it is I say, if she doesn't want to do it she screams and cries. She yells as loud as she can about how she will never love me, she hates me, she wants me gone. She wants a new mom. And you can only imagine how bad it gets when she's in trouble.
Just today I walked into the room to see her standing over the toddler, smacking him because he wasn't doing but she wanted him to. And this isn't the first time it's happened. I was out of the room for literally 20 seconds. So I had to make the role that she is no longer allowed to be alone with her brothers. If I have to be sitting and nursing the baby she has to be in her room. The toddler is not allowed in her room. I reminded her about right before feeding the baby and while I was in the middle of pumping she had decided that she was going to lock her little brother in her room with her and scream at him for doing what she told him to.
I have had to ban play fighting in my house because my toddler doesn't know his own strength and every day I have to remind her no play fighting no pretend hitting nothing of the sort because she encourages my toddler to beat her up to the point of tears. I've caught her telling him ""hit me hit me come on hit me"" and while I do curb his bad behavior as well he doesn't understand why it is bad yet. I keep telling her he doesn't understand that hitting is bad he does not understand how strong he is because this toddler is like a tiny bodybuilder. But she doesn't listen. Every single rule in the house she ignores because it's an inconvenience to her and she doesn't care. And that was her response to my question of why she doesn't listen to the rules. 
I tried to spend one-on-one time with her I tried to do things with her but she wants nothing to do with me. I am at a loss and I don't know what to do anymore with her. I feel like an absolutely terrible mother because I'm doing everything in my power to try to raise her to be a decent human being only for her to constantly scream and cry to hit a toddler to bully her brothers for her to tell me what a horrible person I am because I have to enforce her rules I have to be the bearer of bad news I have to be the one that tells her she can't have candy for breakfast. She's so well behaved for everybody else the school has zero complaints about her but at home she's not the angel everybody thinks she is and I don't know what to do anymore.

549,How often can I expect a visit by the grandparents?,"So, we became a family about two years ago. My parents and the parents of my wife are visiting their grandson only 2-3 times a year. The car ride is under two hours. It is always expected that we have to visit them. Even though our two year old son hates (!) car rides and it's always such an effort to travel for us: Packing all the things for us + the little one + our dog. Not to mention it's almost 30€ for gas... And while we are visiting them, noone seems to care and wants to spend time with our little one. PS: The grandparents are between 60-65 years old and still working (just like us).

Still we visit the grandparents about 10-15 times a year. When we don't do that, the grandparents still don't come to visit us. It would be such a bless having someone to come over like once or twice a month for a quick babysit. We don't have anyone. My parents had both their parents very close (~10 min drive) and therefore a huge advantage in my eyes. But they seem to think having a child without support is easy.

553,Toddler doing teeny tiny poops on the potty — problem or just inexperience?,"So my 2.5 year old boy has been potty training slowly for 6-8 months at this point; we have been mostly following his queues and the last major thing was that he just never asked to poop on the potty until last weekend. I should state that he’s pretty enthusiastic about using the potty and if it weren’t for the poop holdup we’d probably have transitioned him to undies by now.

The “issue” is that the poops are just these tiny nuggets, usually 3-4 of them. Every now and again, usually close to the end of the day, something bigger will come out but I’d still call it a nugget. He’s proud of himself, he gets to wipe and flush and be proud, and I am proud of him too! However, I am wondering if this is something I need to be concerned about? He takes massive loads in his diaper first thing in the morning and sometime shortly after his afternoon nap (we try to get in there to get him on the potty before that happens but it has not been successful so far) so it’s not like he isn’t passing material, but it’s made it really hard to get him to put it in the loo.

It made me think, is it normal for a toddler to cuddle with a man like papa or is that just weird? 
I get there’s a lot of perverts out there but my moms boyfriend isn’t one of them. He just genuinely loves his granddaughter. 
Is there anyone out there who has a daughter and wouldn’t let her cuddle with her grandpa? 
I have a son, should I not let him fall asleep with grandma?

556,Is this behaviour common for an almost 4 year old?,"My son will be 4 in february. He has the bad habbit of not answering when someone asks him something. Can be the  most simple thing and he won't answer and this is driving my husband up the wall. This doesn't happen all the time (specially if he is interested in the question) and happens more with my husband than with me. I was wondering how common this is for the age. Btw, he has a perfect command of languages (bilingual), and basically speaks non-stop. My husband has ADHD, which is always on the back of my mind (meaning if this could be an early sign that my son has the same).",yzibyl,1,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yzibyl/is_this_behaviour_common_for_an_almost_4_year_old/,parenting
557,Is the school overstepping?,"So, I got a call from my daughters (11) teacher today due to something she said during a snap chat group chat with her friends. I knew there had been an argument, (she actually wasnt involved in the argument as such, bit is friends with both who were) and she had left the chat, what I didn't know, was that her frustrations got the better of her (she doesn't like conflict) and she sent a message saying she wanted to stab someone (like 'I'm so frustrated I could stab you'). Several of the kids took a screen shot and showed their parents who then emailed the school with concerns. 
I absolutely know that this was not appropriate for her to send, even when she didn't mean it (it's kind of a family thing, we watch a lot of b movie horror and it's kind of affected our family lexicon, but i need to make it more clear to her that what flies in our home, doesn't work outside with people who don't know the context )and I will be speaking to her about it.

My issue is, that the school has said that there will be consequences, from their end and I'm not sure it's their place to give her consequences a) for something that happened outside of school b) without my input.
I get they have a lot of angry parents, but I feel like this is my issue to deal with, not theirs?

558,Babysitter expenses,So I need opinions. Just graduated nursing school and I have two kids. I am wanting to start working but every daycare has a waitlist so my kids are on it. My sister lives about 40 mins away and I asked her if I start working in December and pay her to watch them until they get into daycare which should be in January. She has a baby too that’s the same age as mine so she will be driving to my house at 6 a.m and watch the kids for 11 hours. I understand that’s long hours so she was saying $300 for 3 days is what she would charge. I agreed on it bc I don’t really have options for childcare plus she’s my sister. The reason she would drive to me is bc her house is not on the way to my work. It’s in a different city. Daycares here are charging $195 each week for two kids. I understand my sisters point bc she’s getting up early and driving to watch my kids which is why I’m paying her $300 for 3 days but I am stressed bc I feel like it’s alot out of my check each week but I gotta do what I gotta do I guess. I guess I’m asking what would you pay a babysitter for 3 days? She is saying if I work 4 days it’s $400 so basically $100 a day. I know it doesn’t sound like much but it’s a lot from my pay.,yzsj4a,0,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yzsj4a/babysitter_expenses/,parenting

560,Has this happened to anyone’s circumcised baby?,"Recently, I discovered that my son (8 mo) has this little pocket in the seam where his skin meets his head.  There seemed to be some white substance trapped in there, most of which came with some gentle wiping with a wet wipe.  I asked a nurse about it, who said there was no sign of adhesion, and there just seemed to be a little pocket.  She thought it was a bit of wipe that had gotten stuck, but that didn’t seem likely with the wipes we use.  She got the last bit out and made it seem like it wasn’t likely to be a problem, though she made it sound like it wasn’t something she’d seen much of.

Well, I just found another little pocket, again with some white substance stuck in there. I’m a little concerned about leaving something in there that potentially cause an infection, but it’s not coming right out and I obviously don’t want to hurt him. 

I’m going to schedule an appointment with his pediatrician to get it checked again. In the meantime… has anyone ever had experience with these?  My Google searches are coming up empty, and I’m a little worried this could cause problems for him down the line.

563,Jealous older sibling,"My daughters are 2 and 2 months. Now before my youngest my daughter was basically the only child in the family only grandchild only nieces. She pretty much had no interaction with kids outside when she started preschool in September (thanks Covid).

We had an incident earlier this week I was wrangling her hubby had the baby rested the car seat on the couch and she broke away from me scrambled onto the couch and managed to topple the car seat. Luckily baby was still strapped in and unharmed.

564,4 year old being touched by a classmate- need advice,"Yesterday my 4 year old daughter told me her vagina was hurting. We went to the bathroom and I looked to see if there was any redness or signs of infection due to improper wiping at school. She had irritation bumps along where her underwear elastic sits, and a lot of redness in her vulva. She has never had any issues with her vulva before, and I give constant reminders of how to properly clean herself after using the bathroom. I asked her some questions about how long it had been bothering her, and what started it.

She shared with me that her friend at school, a 5 year old girl, has been touching her vagina and scratching her with what she said felt like a knife. I’m assuming she didn’t really get cut by a knife, and perhaps she felt fingernails. I asked if she told a teacher and she said no her friend said she would get in trouble if she did.

Thinking back throughout the school year, my daughter has mentioned this friend touching her in ways I don’t think I realized what she was saying- in the first month or so she told me her friend helped her wipe after she went potty- I told her that this isn’t allowed, and she has to wipe herself. She never mentioned it again.Then over the last several weeks she has been telling me that this same friend somehow is getting knives at school and she has to tell her friend she isn’t allowed to cut her with them. I never thought anything of it, since I found it unlikely a 5 year old was carrying knives around the cafeteria unnoticed. 

So the story my daughter has told me is that during lunch the other child is crawling under the table and putting her hand down my daughters pants “cutting” her, and that my daughter has to pull her underwear back up and tell this child to get off the floor and keep eating. 

I feel so awful and don’t know what to do. We go to a private Catholic school, but before VPK my daughter has only ever been in my care. No babysitters, no daycare, just her dad and I. So getting ready for school I made sure to talk to her about how no adults at school should ever touch her vulva. We talk a lot about body safety and who is allowed to touch her and in what context. I have talked to her about respecting her friends’ space and bodies, and she seems to understand that she shouldn’t be touching her friends anywhere private. I use anatomically correct terms and tried to do everything I’ve seen recommended to protect her from adults with bad intentions. Now I feel like I failed because I did not prepare her to uphold boundaries with peers as well. I understand that it may be a mutual curiosity, but I feel like my daughter told the truth when she said she never touched her friend too. I stayed calm and didn’t react to what she was telling me and she was very casual and open when she was telling me everything that happened. 

So I need advice. How do I bring this up to the school? Do I pull her? I don’t want to villainize her friend, as I know curiosity is normal for this age, but Not at the expense of my child’s health and safety. I talked to my daughter about telling an adult if a classmate touches her vulva. I reiterated healthy boundaries and promised she would never be in trouble for telling an adult.",yylam9,107,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yylam9/4_year_old_being_touched_by_a_classmate_need/,parenting

566,Anyone regret buying their expensive / heavy travel system?,"Long story short, I’ve bought a stroller mountain buggy swift with carrycot plus (buying a Joie ispin 360 for a car seat to leave in car). I don’t drive but my partner drives so car seat was better separate as I don’t need it to clip onto the buggy. It hasn’t arrived yet but I researched for ages trying to find something that met our needs. ie. All terrain,  smallish, fairly lightweight, 3 wheel, carrycot is safe for overnight sleeping, parent facing mode for longer (15kg). Etc. 

My friend had a baby a little while ago so is about 6 months ahead of me, and has made me feel a little bad and question my choice of a buggy. Like because I hadn’t got one of the fancy ones they have in John Lewis I’d made a mistake or something.  She has the silvercross wave complete travel system. I think those look amazing and incredibly fancy. But I didn’t want to spent like 1k on a system. I also steered hers and it felt sooo heavy compared to the one I’ve got (I’m only 5ft 2 and pretty small (my partner is short too!). My little sister is 17 years younger than me and from what I can remember from when she was a baby, we used a super lightweight stroller in the end and sold the heavy expensive one!

Its just me and my son(14) most of the time, my son and I are use to it. My son and I have a normal mom son relationship....but I'm also a big kid, I goof off, pull pranks, and kid around with my son. IMO my son and I have a good relationship, my son and I have had the embarrassing conversations that most dad's handle...bc my husband is gone at work 90% of the time. My hubs is tired when he is home and sleeps/naps most of the time. We are quiet when he's home until hubs wakes up. It's our norm. 

I had a conversation(one of many) with my husband the  other day about how I feel like he needs to spend more time with his son. That i feel like it's normal for a dad to say come on (insert kids name) let's go do blah, lets go see blah, let's go...etc. That if he wants a relationship with his son not just now but later in life he's going to have to put in effort. My hubs says they have a relationship. (I disagree)

My hubs dad also worked 90% of the time but when he was home he was forced to go with his dad......if him and his dad had plans usually someone would randomly show up at the house and the dad would bail on their plans...honestly I put blame here.....he had....and still has a bad relationship with his dad.

Tomorrow my hubs has plans to go spend time with a friend....hubs is currently at work so I texted him....this is a copy paste of our conversation 

ME: Are you planning on taking *boy* with you tomorrow?

HIM: I hadn't planned on it didn't think he would want to



I'm seeing RED but haven't responded...this has been an on going conversation over the years and a recent this week conversation. You need to spend time with your kid!

570,Need help understanding what might be happening and what doctor to see,"My 7 year old daughter started to develop (what seems to be) selective hearing issues about 6 months ago. It started near the end of the school year (in May). She, at times, will seemingly be unable to hear anything being said to her. In her words, it sounds like everything is mumbled. It has slowly gotten worse, and happens when my wife talks to her about 90% of the time, and when I talk to her it's only about 10-20% of the time. We have checked with both her current teacher and last year's teacher and this NEVER happens at school. My wife is involved with all of her extra-curricular activites and my daughter NEVER has these issues in any other class or when talking with friends. We did take her for a hearing test at her pediatrician in either June or July, and they said everything with her hearing seemed fine.

Around the same time she started to develop some compulsive tendencies. Examples include: Having a tough time with the seams in both socks and underwear, having to remove and put on socks over and over until they feel right, needing to put her shoes on in a specific way while pulling the tongue of the shoe up a number of times (while counting), needing her blanket to be placed on her at night in a very specific manner (pulled down to a certain level, then pulling each corner of the blanket so it's very taught over her), etc.

It really seems to be some sort of a psychological thing with her, but I can't discern enough of a pattern to figure out what might be causing it or how to help her fix it. It frustrates my wife and I obviously, but it also frustrates my daughter, so it definitely doesn't seem like something being done intentionally.

Does anyone have any advice on what we can do? What type of a doctor we should be talking to?

I will note that we've taken her to a ~~therapist~~ social worker a number of times (about 7-8 sessions I think), but no progress was made. We're at our wits end and just want to find her some help, mainly with the hearing issue.

edit: We're making an appt for an ENT asap and premptively for an actual therapist as well. My wife and I would be shocked if this were an actual ENT issue (but happy if that were the case) so we don't want to have to wait longer. I also wasn't aware that the person our daughter was seeing before was a social worker and not a therapist. We've agreed that an actual therapist would be best moving forward.",yzdr4b,1,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yzdr4b/need_help_understanding_what_might_be_happening/,parenting
571,My son got in a fight,"I got the phone call I never thought I'd ever get about one of my kids. Today my 11yr old got in a fight. My heart sank when the assistant principal told me. Then I heard her say he was standing up for a friend. My embarrassment turned into being proud of him. Although I was still disappointed I had received that phone call. 

Apparently a bully was picking on his friend and my son stood up to this bully which then pushed my son. So in return my son slapped him and then it turned into fists and kicking each other. I had no words but to apologize for his behavior as in the assistant principals mind she was partially ok with it but not and said we needed to talk to him about having an adult handle the situation.

Then I told her about another situation that happened two days ago when there was no adult present and my son had to push another child off of another because a bully was choking another child and they couldn't breath. Which he told the principal about it and she told him she would find those two kids. He got praised for that incident. 

But today the assistant principal wanted to talk about his rage and that she doesn't want this to escalated in his behavior like my son is a trouble maker. I hear all the time about these kids at his school who are bullies and no one ever does anything about them. My sons teachers praise him for standing up for his friends and being very helpful. 

When he gets home we will be having a talk with him. I just wish the school system would do something about the bullies. My son was bullied in 2nd grade and has came a long way because we have taught him to defend himself.

She was in the shower. All by herself.

That isn’t the way it’s supposed to go! I’m supposed to remind her fifty two times and then she’s supposed to excessively whine at me that she needs help turning on the water!

590,Toddler having a lot of nightmares,"My son (3M) is having nightmares most nights and is awake for 2-3 hours afterwards. He will wake up crying, I calm him and try and get him back to sleep. He usually calms down after a few minutes but struggles actually getting to sleep again. Today, he told me he was worried about “bad dreams” and I told him mummy is always here. He won’t go to sleep unless I’m in his bed which would be fine if it wasn’t up to 3 hours - it usually ends at 4-5am. I know it’s a bad habit we’ve got into so please don’t judge, I already know. 

I should note two things:

He’s had a couple of night terrors a few months ago, he falls back asleep fine, as awful as it is when he’s had one. He’d scream, shake, sweat and wet himself. The nightmares are different, he fully wakes up, cries and says he’s had a bad dream. 

Second, it could be due to a huge life change - losing his dad two years ago (he passed from cancer). He knows his dad isn’t around anymore and I know it effects him. 

Anyone any tips in reducing the nightmares? I know it’s normal for children to have them but it’s the frequency and amount of sleep he’s losing. I’m obviously exhausted too as I usually don’t manage to sleep until 2am so it’s almost all night if he has a nightmare. Obviously nothing to that it feels like for him I know.

595,Guide on how to survive as a single 19 year old father (COVID edition!),"This is actually just a rant phrased in my own creative, sarcastic way. But on the weird off chance that someone can learn something from this, glad I could help.

This guide is for those who: Have no family, have no partner, have no money, have no education, and live in one of the most expensive cities in the USA

*Step 1:* Understand that having a child despite the situation listed above is probably the worst decision you could make. Do not get someone pregnant. Especially not an ex during a one night stand who will dump the baby on you and disappear into the night out of spite

If you fail step 1, continue with this guide

*Step 2:* Work during the pregnancy. You have nine months to save. You may not have family but the mother does. Move in with her and her family and just work. The schedule that works best is: 16 hour shift, 2 hours to unwind at home with hobbies, 5 hours of sleep, 1 hour in the morning to shower and get ready for work. Most jobs won't let you work 7 doubles so take on a 2nd part time job and work doubles on the days your 1st job is forcing you to take off. DO NOT TAKE DRUGS. DRUGS ARE EXPENSIVE. DRUGS WILL MAKE YOU CRASH. LET YOUR BRAIN DEVELOP A SCHEDULE AND LET IT AUTOPILOT. It's ok if you lose track of time, if don't remember the last 2 weeks, whatever. Just don't stop.

*Step 3:* Baby is here! All that money saved can buy you supplies and equipment! What's that? The mother has dissapeared into the night and her parents have no reason to let you stay in their house if their daughter is no longer there? Welp time to make use of Reddit! Redditors are usually safer than Craigslist. Post on your cities subreddit explaining your situation and ask for a place to stay. Keep your rent budget between 300-500 per month and hope to God someone is kind enough to accept. If not, put baby into government care.

If someone is letting you stay in their basement for cheap, continue with the guide

*Step 4:* Make use of your time at home. Newborns need a lot of attention! Use all that money you saved up to spend time with the little one for the next couple months. During that time, it's time to get an education. Getting a GED online is super quick and easy, so make sure to complete that ASAP. As soon as you have that, apply for a tech bootcamp. Cybersecurity is usually a good one to go for. Ivy league schools like California Institute of Technology even offer 3 month bootcamps for cheap! You're now 14k in debt but they look GREAT on resumes!

*Step 5:* The baby is 3 months old now, and you're running out of savings. That's bad. The good news? You're now ""technically"" a college graduate. More good news? The government provides Headstart for your child for free since you're such low income! Put that lil  cutie into the nearest program and that grants you 6 hours of free time Monday-Friday. Time to look for a remote job.

*Step 6:* Coming to terms with the fact your certificate is worthless and you've essentially been scammed. No one will hire you with only a bootcamp education. You've wasted $14,000, and a bachelors from WGU would have been worth more AND cheaper. The silver lining? Sales positions.

*Step 7:* Abandon all morals. It's survival of the fittest. You and your child is all that matters. No matter whose life you ruin, no matter how many people hate you, it's time to sell insurance. As a college graduate, you qualify to work for a high end insurance agency. These are just legal scam centers. You will be informing people on the regular, that they do not qualify for maximum reimbursement due to whatever bullshit lies your manager wants you to make up. Everyone will hate you. But oh god, the commission pay. The more you screw people over, the more money you make. COMMISSION PAY DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK. SOME MONTHS WILL BE BELOW MINIMUM WAGE. DURING THOSE MONTHS, ONLY EAT BREAKFAST. SAVE ALL MONEY FOR THE BABY, THEY ARE EXPENSIVE. NOTHING SHOULD EVER CHANGE FOR HER. 3 MEALS A DAY, SCHOOL, BUBBLE BATH, NICE CLOTHES, DIAPERS. SHE SHOULD FEEL NO CHANGE EVEN IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING. KEEP THE LIL ONE HAPPY

*Step 8:* Use your sales experience to move into a legit sales position. Digital marking consultant is an entry level position you can get just using your certificate & year of sales experience. Become an account manager and work with businesses on their ad campaigns. Use the scummy tactics you learned in insurance to maximize profits for businesses. Stretch the truth, find loopholes. The more money they make, the more money you make. And best part? You aren't ruining anyones life this time. Just making people buy products that don't quite work the way they thought it would. An easy recovery, a learning experience if anything. 

*Step 9:* Climb the corporate ladder. Commission pay only works if you're working hard. Some months are a struggle, others are great. You have a child, you want consistently. Climb to a manager position, get a salary. 

*Step 10:* Rent your own place and move out of the redditors basement you've been living in

Sarcastic guide is over. I'm moving into a house this Monday. My daughter is turning 3 next month and she's both happy and healthy. I didn't talk much about the actual child raising part in my rant but she has never been without necessities. I have never let her schedule change. I think she's picked up on my stress growing up because she's got some very clingy tendencies. I've probably caused her to need therapy later down the line just from our situation. But we're alive. I'm making a comfortable living wage, starting from literal zero 3 years ago. I've had some weird run ins with her mom, her moms family, and my family all trying to take her from me. This has been 3 years of fighting, struggling, and luck to get here. I wish this lifestyle on no one.

My husband has been a heavy drinker for our entire relationship but never said anything about it cause it never really got under my skin. Now, being pregnant and sober, I’m noticing how much he really drinks and it bugs me so much to the point that I have no attraction towards him lately. For example, on some random weekday we’ll be hanging out and he finishes 2 bottles of wine himself and then decides to drink whiskey afterwards. He’s been passing out on the couch and won’t be able to get up in the early morning to help with our puppy.

I think this trend of really rough childhood respiratory illnesses is going to continue for the next few years, and I think maybe as a community we parents can encourage (but not require) general mask use during cold and flu season, places around the world already do this so why can't we?

601,Update on school and Snapchat drama,"Hi all, the post got locked, but I wanted to say thanks to those of you who actually addressed my question/concern rather than just attacked my child and parenting. I didn't want to jump in feet first if I was out of line and a lot of you gave me the perspective I needed to just calm down and let consequences at school and consequences at home be two seperate things, which is a good call and what I have done. 

She is home now, The first thing I did was send her to clean her room for 30 minutes while she thought about what had gone on during the group chat argument and during school, and then we would talk. I got her to give me the run down, the kid the message was intended for was not one of the kids who told their parent, he is actually one of her best friends. She didnt realise that the rest of the group would see it and think it was for them (she answered a comment from him). I told her it is best to just not use any kind of violent hyperbole, it isn't necessary to get your point across, and this was something she should have just let go. 

As far as school consequenses goes, it seems everyone was questioned, three of them (daughter included) got a red card and were made to apologise to each other. she lost her lunch time play and had to sit in the office with the deputy head. She had a good talking to (as did a couple of others) about not getting into arguments online, apparently he kept giving her a bucket metaphor (about not letting her bucket over fill) which is basically the same as what I have said to her. She needs to step away before her frustration gets the better of her. She may feel that her friend is being taken advantage of, but you can only do so much about other people's decisions, and all she has done is make it worse for herself. 

We have agreed that it is a good idea to just step away from Snapchat for now, as that is where most of the drama happens and she finds it hard to not get involved when her phone is pinging constantly (apparently just leaving the group chat isn't enough, as one of the girls keeps adding her back in).

Would you help her search, just supervise or would she be on her own? Do you keep her home from school so she won't use the washroom there?

How do you convince her to actually look and not lie about it. How severe of consequences do you use if the jewelry is gone and conversely do you give a reward if it is returned?

Partner's brother strongly dislikes me. He doesn't say a word to me at gatherings and completely ignores me . He doesn't come over our place when invited and just overall doesn't tell my partner why he doesn't like me. I feel like it's because during arguments or disagreements etc he would be my partners person to vent to.

I tried to explain to him and say I apologize for the wrongs I've done as I'm a human being and also bettering myself. And half of our disagreements are just misunderstanding, my partner and I. 

Now I'm really triggered by this as I was bullied as a kid and shunning was one things kids did to me in my small private school class. It was horrible. I explained this to him as well and want to know how to fix things but I don't think he will respond or care to mend our relationship.

I still don't understand y he has such an issue picking his own son up if he is crying tho.

Anyway, there have been SO many times where when my husband has our son and I hear the baby screaming bloody murder, I go to them and my husband has his gaming headphones on basically ignoring our son...he tells me to leave him alone cause he just wants to get picked up and to let him cry it out.

I'm sorry but if I see a baby red in the face and he's been crying longer than 5 minutes I'm going to check him to see what's wrong. 9 times out of 10 it's something simple, like he's uncomfortable and needs to be repositioned, needs a diaper change(he has a rash, suprise suprise right?) Or he's over stimulated or tired and wants  to sleep.

My son hardly crys when he's with me...only when I miss his early hungry cues or sometimes during a diaper change, cause of the rash.

I don't hold my son all day, but I do tend to his needs. I talk to him and explain what I'm doing, take him around the house and show him things, which he seems to like.

My husband props him up on the couch in his den and leaves him there, no talking, no interaction, nothing.

How can I get my husband to see he needs to interact better with our son and that he can't spoil him by holding him?",yxtbf6,846,826,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yxtbf6/husband_thinks_i_spoil_1_month_old_by_holding_him/,parenting

610,Traveling with a sick infant??,"Hi! Title pretty much says it all. 


UPDATE: he woke up still with the fever so flight has been rescheduled.

Our flight is tomorrow. My infant randomly developed a fever tonight. (99.5-100.4) He’s still acting completely normal. I’ve given children Tylenol, stripped him down, humidifier on, etc. I literally wouldn’t even have known he wasn’t feeling well until I randomly realized he felt a little warm. 

Only thing is now I am worried about traveling with him. Unfortunately we are unable to cancel/reschedule and get a refund. We’re only going to my moms house, it’s a two hour domestic flight. Once at my moms I definitely will not be bringing him anywhere else until he feels better. He’s 11 months. 

Any tips for traveling with a sick infant? I just want to keep him as comfortable as possible. 

Like I said, fever randomly came out of nowhere. Baby stays at home with me. My bonus kids do go to high school and play sports, work, etc. I’m suspecting it probably came from there.",yz2yeb,1,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yz2yeb/traveling_with_a_sick_infant/,parenting
611,Can an uneven floor cause a baby to roll?,"Hi everyone.  I'm expecting my first baby in April and I have really been getting a bit frustrated trying to find a bassinet that seems safe.  I saw a review on one I really liked saying that it wasn't level which cause their baby to roll right into the side...which led me to think of my bedroom floor.  It's on a slant, just enough that a ball will roll if you place it on the ground without steadying it.  Would a sturdy bassinet or crib be okay even if it's on a slightly tilted surface so long as it doesn't budge?  Or am I looking at some kind of special baby physics issue?  I'll be a first time parent so I really don't know what to expect from a sleeping baby, I just know that safe sleep is on their back and I want to make sure they stay safe.  I'm probably going to have to get something small to sleep on in my office since it's level and keep baby in there, but I'd rather sleep in the comfy bed my fiancee and I just finished paying off 🤣 it's a two bedroom apt so space is limited and our bedroom is the largest room so most ideal to have us and baby in until baby is old enough to be in the office-then-converted-into-nursery but obviously can't if safety is an issue.  We are also actively working on getting out of here into a nicer, larger home but I'm trying to be prepared for the possiblity that we might be stuck here for a year or (really really hoping not) two.

I was hoping maybe someone here had experience with a similar issue that could give me some relief?  Or maybe know of a model bassinet that might be adjustable to the floor? My fiancee says I overthink but this has been really bothering me.  It's hard to find the bassinet and crib to suit our needs without knowing where it's going.",yz2y8e,1,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yz2y8e/can_an_uneven_floor_cause_a_baby_to_roll/,parenting

We have verbal agreements on things such as pay, which house the kids and the nanny will be at and such. But we all agree that putting these down on paper will provide peace of mind to everyone involved and we can always adjust these things as we go.

622,weighing options for school year,"TLDR: Should I move my kids during the school year or keep them in and move at the end of the year. If we stay til the end of the years, I'll be without my husband during the week for the next 5 months. If I move them now, I have to figure out alternative plans for one of my kids. LONG POST AHEAD.

So we're moving to a new city about 2 hours away. My husband got promoted and so we're going through the selling and moving and finding new schools and basically everything is changing lol 

I did all my research and found a great school that I thought could take both my kids, 1st grade and Prek3. We had the tour today and it turns out they only have a spot for one in the spring semester (1st grade)  and they will have an opening for the other the next semester for Prek4.

Well after my initial shock, I started mulling over WTF I'm gonna do. Long story short, I work full time from home and my husband works a lot of hours at a high stress job ...I'm the primary parent so all the drop off, pick up, and after school stuff is on me. My kids currently attend a catholic school that has prek3, which has been great for my 3 year old and awesome for me because they're finally at the same place and same schedule. I have been mulling over my options all day and I'd love some advice from anyone who has moved in the middle of the school year.


1) stay through the end of the school year at their current school. My dad lives in our current town and has told me we would be welcome to stay if need be. This option would be able to keep them both in school and finish the year with their friends. The down side is we wouldn't be together as a family for about 5 months. We would go up to our new house for the weekends and spend time together as a family, then during the week stay with my dad. We would make the official move once the school year is over.

2) Move my one child to the new school and hire a nanny to help part time until he starts school with his brother in the fall. I have looked at a few other options for preschool and daycare and I really don't want to put him in a new school for 5 months only to move him to another school....this kid has already been to 3 different schools in the last two years, I know kids are resilient but it's a major stressor of mine.

Another stressor I have it that since I'm in charge with pick up and drop off, them being two different places will take me longer and that will cut in to my work time. My boss is supportive but it will take me an hour as opposed to 30 mins and I have to make up that time at the end of the day.

Idk what the best option is but I'd love any tips from anyone who has moved in the middle of the school year or who has dealt with being away from your spouse for long stretches....needless to say I'm stressed AF lol",yz0jh2,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yz0jh2/weighing_options_for_school_year/,parenting
623,I’m scared of my own baby.,"

Before I have comments asking what the worst thing a 10 month old cutie could do, just note that it wasn’t even her fault. 

I experience sleep paralysis and hallucinations on the regular due to migraines, trauma and insomnia. Not even a full hour ago I had one of the absolute worst episodes of sleep paralysis and then proceeded to have a hallucination DIRECTLY AFTER! Despite having hallucinations for the past year and a half, I still can’t distinguish them from reality. 

I was just waking up, heard my daughter eating something in her pack n play. I slowly opened my eyes to see her staring at me quietly while sucking on her pacifier. She spit it out and smiled once she realized I was awake, which is 100% normal. Her smile lasted a few seconds and grew to this weird forced smile I’ve NEVER seen her do. I hadn’t caught on yet so I was worried something was wrong with her. Her smile then turned to a wickedly wide and grim one. She STARTED GROWING?!?! She shifted into this large and lanky figure with dark skin and an unsettling face. Stepped out of her pack n play and proceeded to crawl towards me as this figure, she stopped right next to my face and just continued staring at me with no noise gradually getting closer. My amazing sweet fur baby, Cactus, pounced on my chest and started hissing, knocking me out of the paralysis. 

I was hyperventilating and crying silently. I had realized that my daughter WAS SLEEPING. After about 45 minutes I was obviously still shaken up but extremely tired still. I started to doze off again unwillingly. I think that cactus might’ve had something to do with that one because he wouldn’t leave my side afterwards.  So at this point I’m half asleep when I literally hear someone SCREAMING for help from the kitchen. I got up and ran instantly only to be met with absolutely nothing, exactly what I needed lol. 

Am I the only one who literally experiences shit like this?! When I hear people say they have SP, they talk about someone standing over them but I never hear about people shifting! My poor baby girl!

My daughter is 4. She has never been in daycare and she’s always been at home. As my husband was a stay at home dad for her first two years, now I (the mother) is a stay at home mother. We decided it was time to start preschool, we are starting slow. 3 mornings a week from 8-11am. It’s been a few months and she is not adjusting with the separation anxiety. She did well for a few weeks and now it’s total hell. She has a great time in school and loves it when she settles down but the initial getting her in the door is borderline traumatic. This morning for example, she throws herself on the ground and I have to put her in the class and shut the door. She bangs and screams on the door begging for me while yelling at teachers to get away from her. It absolutely broke me. This happens almost every time. I feel like I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. If I withdraw her how will she be ready for next year when she has to be in school full time? We have tried everything. Carpool, dad taking her in, grandma taking her, walking her back to her class. Im at a loss and need advice.

636,Father Spiraling into Depression,"I'm approaching 40yrs old with a 6wk old, struggling for two reasons mainly: I never had a desire to have kids and my relationship and life with my wife was perfect before our child. Some more context and advanced apologies for length:

Never in my life did I want kids or think about raising a family, but I met my (perfect) wife six years ago and after a while she began expressing interest in possibly having a child someday. After years of research and discussing pros and cons, we decided to start trying. One of my main motivators, apart from wanting a happy life for my wife, was that no matter how horrible the stories I heard were, they were ALWAYS tinged with this sense of happiness and joy (even if in the moment the parent wanted to give away their baby, or worse!). I figured this joy was an instinctual switch that flipped once the baby was born and was something I wouldn't understand until I was a father.

This has simply not happened for me. If anything the feelings I had before are amplified and I now find myself in fits of depression because I didn't just compromise my beliefs, but did it in such a way that has forever-lasting physical, mental, and financial impacts on me and the ones I love. This isn't just a dad's post partem depression that will pass--I loathe the ""it gets better"" cliche advice. This isn't about losing sleep in the early stages of raising a child and most people giving that advice always wanted kids, had something missing from their lives beforehand, or there's some other pre-existing bias.

The second issue is that the relationship between me and my wife was perfect and there was nothing critically missing from our life. She felt a baby was the natural next step and on top of that was feeling disconnected from family given we had been out in NYC for years while both of our families are 3k miles away. We've had open dialogue about these feelings.

Selfishly I still get depressed knowing we can't go to spontaneous shows, museums, restaurants, bars, etc. which we were doing 2-3 times a week out of pure fun. We've both been through our own rough times before meeting each other so this was always a welcome relief. It might seem immaterial and petty, but we were truly partners in crime and loved doing everything and anything together. We're both nerds and don't have friend groups that we hang out with regularly, we fill that role for each other. So bringing all that to a screeching halt for the next 18 or so years (probably more, given we'll eventually need to move to the suburbs, probably in a new state) is incomprehensible. My wife has been incredibly generous by suggesting I go to the park for a break, grab a bite or drink at our favorite place just to get away, but none of that interests me without her. From here on out we won't get that sort of time together again until the baby is old enough for a babysitter and even then we're only getting a couple hours. 

It's utterly depressing that what we'll consider happy or fun 1:1 moments going forward are only happy or fun because they're an escape from the difficulties of this new life. In the meantime I have to force myself to enjoy doing the things we used to love on my own, as a release, otherwise all this depression and anxiety gets worse I guess. In a year I'll probably think these things are enjoyable alone as I become desperate for relief, and I hate it.

We're becoming the stereotype of exhausted parents having to scrounge for enjoyable private moments while eating and sleeping whenever we can, usually not together. And we CHOSE this. 

On top of all this, it tears me apart to see my wife cry every week from exhaustion and stress. And this is after a delivery that almost killed her. I hate that we volunteered for this.

Everything is validating my prior beliefs and I have yet to hear a convincing, selfless argument for having a child. The only way this becomes ""better"" is that the memories of the prior life fade and become less tangible, while the space is filled with these new memories, and the bar for ""happy"" and ""fun"" moments becomes excruciatingly low.

For now I'm seeking therapy to try and get clarity on these feelings. Meantime I'm supporting my wife in any way imaginable so she maintains her sanity. Not sure where I go from here.",yyaime,33,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yyaime/father_spiraling_into_depression/,parenting

638,Would you put your child in a Christian preschool if you aren’t raising them as Christian?,"Edited to add an update of sorts: Went for my in person tour today and it was honestly super chill. They soft kids into classes based on what age they are on Aug 15th (when our city’s school start) so even though he’s nearly 2, he’ll be in the 1yr old class until next year when he’s 2.5 so he won’t even really see the full scope of the curriculum until we’ve been there for 9 months. I appreciate all the advice!


I have been asked to consider a teaching position at a nearby Christian based preschool. 

I am a somewhat Christian. My husband is an atheist. Together we’ve decided not to raise our kids with religion as we want them to make that choice on their own when they’re older and informed well enough to do so. We have a son who is nearly two. Because we don’t have any other childcare arrangements, if I were to take this job he would absolutely have to come to work with me. 

My husband is okay with it because it’s “just preschool” but I know they use a Christian centered curriculum and it’s put me kind of on the fence. He’s almost two now and at the most we’ll be there for a year or so. 

Would a year at this age be so terrible? I mean he’s not really old enough to comprehend God or Jesus or any of that jazz but would you be afraid as a parent that it’ll stick? I have an offer for another school in the area but the pay isn’t great, the commute is terrible and the teachers I met are all inexperienced so I feel they’d have trouble accommodating my son since he’s not a typically developing 2yr old

I don't love how much his current class spends sitting and doing worksheets, I also think a lot of the structure of US public education is really soul crushing and doesn't encourage real learning...BUT he's so smart, I know he could do better and actually get something out of school. It's a Spanish immersion, which is part of the struggle - he is basically at a 1st grade level in Spanish due to the pandemic. How do I encourage him?

I have made sure that my husband gets breaks/time to himself. He does try but all I would like is a massage (I have severe anxiety so I have tons of knots in my back and neck). However, I have never gotten a moment to do that. I haven't even gotten to get my hair done in over a year, maybe more. 

My husband has tried setting up for his friend's daughter to babysit, but she has canceled every week for the last month, for reasons I understand. However, I am tired. So so tired. Both mentally, physically, and emotionally. I am in counseling but that's a mess in itself and my therapist cancels on me all the time.

I have no friends near me and no actual real friends. I am just puttering out and losing motivation for everything. I feel like such a terrible mom.

Sorry to rant. Just needed to get that out before it ate me alive.

Edit to add: my husband does so much to try and help, but he can work upwards of 7 days a week/10 hour days. We own our own business. It isn't something he can just not go in for.

Update: we sent the kids to the grandparents for the weekend (who live about 2 hours away). Even though I don't like them going over there (for many reasons), I was super sick and it was super needed. We had a super calm Saturday just watching Netflix and hanging out.

641,Build a Career or Have a Baby?,"Hello! 

I am 28 and I got married to my husband 1 and a half years ago and since then have been growing in my career. I held off having a baby because I wanted to travel and grow in my career at work. 

I was promised for about 7 months for a promotion and title change to Manager at a large global company, I would've been the first female manager under 30. My director sent in my application to HR for the approval and unfortunately heard today it was denied because recently they decided to let go almost half of the employees at the company and there is no longer a budget to hire a team under me for 2023, because i'd have no team I don't qualify for a manager title.

my director still fought for me and offered me a 14% raise which I happily accepted, except my vision of being a manager and then having a baby and going on a maternity leave knowing in the back of my head I reached my career goal at this time is upsetting me. 

I was promised the later half of next year that they would be able to work the budget to be able to hire someone under me and finally giving me the title I deserve. But I can't be sure considering a promise has already been broken at this time and I don't want to wait again to have a baby. I feel like I put a hold on my family planning for my career for it to just not work out the way I hoped it would. 

i'd love to hear from you ladies to help me feel better about this situation. I want to try for a baby soon and this is just bothering me.",yywjvn,1,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yywjvn/build_a_career_or_have_a_baby/,parenting

I have to stay up all night with screaming sick baby.
I have to put her to bed, but don't worry, I get to go get her when she wakes up at 3am.

It's almost 3:30am and I'm fucking sobbing, she's sobbing. Husband is downstairs playing video games. He couldn't POSSIBLY put her to bed now because he has to sleep for work tomorrow at 1pm. He also ""doesn't have the boobs"" 

Resent is the lightest way to put it when I have to fight and scramble for any scraps of free/me time. I have to eat standing up, or in parts, or not at all. It's not fair.

UPDATE:
I confronted him and told him that he needed to be more involved. That it wasn't about occasionally doing the dishes, or one night of spending an hour with the baby. I told him he needed to pay attention to what's going on and pitch in. 

He proceeded to say that he has done nothing wrong and I am the problem. I just asked for extra help. He brought up how i didnt vaccume the carpet properly, how i forget to throw my trash out sometimes, how i leave my empty twa mugs on the coffee table. He said that i cant take crisitism, so why should he? I told him that his constant berating of me makes me feel worthless. I just want to go kill myself and i would have except for my daughter. He didnt care. So, guess I'm packing my shit up. I'm going to stay with my mom for maybe a week. Then thinking about driving 7 hours to stay with my sister a while. Hopefully he doesn't realize I'm technically kidnapping his daughter and doesn't call the police. 
I've also been telling his best friend (who has a daughter 2 months younger than mine) about all this. I don't think she'll have my back, but at least it's all recorded. I also have the string of messages of him basically telling me to go fuck myself after asking for help. 

I tried guys. I really did. I don't know what to do from here. I go back to work in 3 months. The daycare deposit is already paid. I have to leave my two beloved dogs behind.

646,Help: 5yo sent to Principal's office 3 times this week. I'm at a loss,"As the title states, my kid(Kindergarten)was just sent to the principal's office for the 3rd time this week. Before this week he's not had any major behavioral issues. In Preschool he didn't have any major behavioral issues.

From what I've been told by the teacher and principal the problems largely center around him trying to be the boss of other kids and it gets bad because he sometimes gets physical because of it. He's also almost a head than most the other kids so that can be seen as an extra layer of severity in the eyes of the teacher.

I'm not sure what to do. Obviously we've been talking to him about it and implementing consequences, but it feels like it's getting worse, not better. I feel so guilty because I work full time and clearly he has needs that aren't getting met. My husband has been unemployed for several months so he's been primary caretaker but he tends to have a short fuse. Is this happening because he yells too much? Have I been too permissive? Are we just shitty parents in general?

I got nexplanon in my arm and when it expires in 3 years my fiancé is going to get a vasectomy.

Im so sick of people not taking me seriously!! It’s so annoying to get those remarks. I truly do not believe I’d make it through another pp. and no one sees the seriousness in that. Im so sick of people projecting onto me. I don’t care if you think my kid needs a sibling. Okay rant over!

I know it’s developmentally normal for her age, but everything I do to try and stop this behavior doesn’t help. She literally will laugh at me if I try to discipline her. She’s had screen time completely wiped out this last week, toys have been taken, time outs feel like it takes up our entire day, and it just feels like it’s getting worse. 
The biting is especially new and just started today. As I’m writing this, she bit me really really hard about 20 minutes ago and there’s STILL a mark! 
She doesn’t get spanked, she doesn’t even get yelled at, nothing. So WHY she thinks it’s ok to do to me is beyond me. 

I know this won’t stop overnight, and the only reason I’m reaching out is because it’s steadily getting worse.

My 5yo daughter recently started making those weird face that i can only describe as ""itchy nose"", ""surprised face"" and ""angry face"" (exactly the faces you have in mind) - while watching TV, eating, writing, painting and basically anything that keeps your mind ""distracted"", when she is talking she does not make those faces.

&#x200B;

When she was younger she has a mini phase of doing those faces, we told her to try and notice when she does them, she did and even stopped.

But it came back a few months ago.

She's happy, has friends, has hobbies and activities, enjoys life and social.

Recent life events: moved to a new house (our first house) hence - new friends + started Kindergarten (has friends and loves it there).

I asked my mom about it and she said that I used to do it too but it went away and all kids do it at some point.

No one has had a full night of sleep for a week. I've used up all my PTO taking care of my little. 

I've been at it for a week. Son's at five days. Wife started yesterday. We still have a long ride in front of us. 

Thanks for listening to me rant. Do you have any strategies to boost mental health before we go all The Shining on each other (not really, but you know what I mean)?

665,Mourning the family I know I’ll never have.,"Please be kind I’m already feeling a bit guilty for even thinking this way.

Let me preface by saying I love my S/O. He is the greatest dad to our baby and even though immediately postpartum it was rocky we’ve been back on a great track.

That said, today I seen a video on Instagram of a long time friend announcing her 3rd pregnancy with her S/O and for some reason my eyes swelled up with tears immediately. I got upset, jealous, and just sad.

I always envisioned myself with 2-3 babies, my husband, and I. Living wherever in the world that we wanted.

However the relationship I’m in.. that’s not possible. First off, he has other children. It’ll never be just “us.” if that makes sense. Although I do indeed love my bonus kids. (They’re teens) On top of that he doesn’t want any more children so we’re one and done. Lastly even if we decided to separate it’ll never be just my family. I’ll always have to share. 

I had a really rough ending to my pregnancy (thanks preeclampsia) so knowing that I’ll never get another chance at a healthy pregnancy experience was hard to accept at first. But I had gotten over it and was really content for a while. 

But for some reason after that video today I feel all of those emotions brought back up. Almost like I’m in a period of mourning, in a sense? Like I had this vision for my life and the life I’m living now is the exact opposite and idk why it has me feeling so crushed today. Has anyone gone through this?

(& before anyone says anything no I absolutely am not trying to convince my S/O to have more kids. I completely respect his decision and we agreed on being one and done.)",yy8hyd,18,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yy8hyd/mourning_the_family_i_know_ill_never_have/,parenting

668,Toddler doesn’t eat food,"My 3yo never eats any actual meals, she’ll just have a few bites of a cracker or one chip and sometimes a fruit pouch.  She’s NEVER ONCE eaten an actual meal before (like meat, pasta, veggies, bread, etc) and it’s always worried me.  If it weren’t for pedia sure, I don’t think she’d be alive sadly.  Last visit to the pediatrician they said she is not gaining enough weight, so they recommended pedia sure.  Thankfully she started gaining again and is now at normal size.  

So my question is, how can I get her to eat actual meals?  Or should I not worry since she’s at normal weight now?  It just seems like pedia sure and a few chips a day isn’t enough to be healthy, right?  

Oh and yes, I’ve already asked the doctor that.  They had no useful tips other then “just keep trying”, as if I don’t already do that everyday lol.

670,Questions about divorce,"I (36) am a dad to a 3 year old and husband to my wife (37) of 9 years. We have been growing apart for years now.  Mainly since our daughter was born.  Having a child seems to have sped up the process of our separation.  Lately, it seems like we can't stand each other for more than a second.  We've tried therapy, and tried to work on our marriage.  However, it seems like we've just grown to be different people.  We have talked about divorce before, but never in a committed way.  We both love our daughter more than anything.  It's the reason we are still together.  But divorce seems to be innevitable.  So my questions are for those who have kids and have gotten divorced and people who's parents got divorced when they were kids.

 How did it affect you?  Did you go through it all at once, or slowly (sleep in separate beds > move out > etc)?  Did you stay together legally, since there are financial benefits for you and the kid?  How did you deal with custody/time sharing?

671,Help,"I am just at a loss. I don’t know how to word this. I don’t know anything right now. I am a mom to a four-year-old, a two (almost 3 year) old and to a one year old. I’m with their dad but it’s mainly just me because he works a lot and I am just the main caregiver. My two-year-old still doesn’t sleep through the night, my one-year-old is the wildest boy that I’ve ever seen. He’s always getting into something always getting hurt. My four-year-old is sassy and teases her brother nonstop. I love them all so much but I feel like I’m drowning. My two-year-old has started to act out he’s been hitting and pulling his sisters hair today he ripped out a huge chunk of her hair, which he also did yesterday. I yelled at him yesterday and put him in the corner. Today… I lost it and I smacked his butt about four times in a row pretty hard And I feel absolutely fucking terrible. Lately I just don’t feel like myself. I’ve always been a calm mom, I’ve always love cuddling them, I’ve been so active in playing. But this past year since having my youngest, I am the exact opposite of who I am. I scream all the time at them for just acting like kids, I don’t play with them. I even have a hard time cuddling them sometimes. i’ve tried Zoloft. and now I’m on BuSpar. nothing really helps. I’m just terrified that I’m ruining them and that they’re going to hate me. I’m having a hard time really putting this all into words so I’m probably missing a whole bunch of stuff but I just need some advice. I just want them to love me and feel loved. I don’t want to chip away at their amazing personalities. I just want us all to be happy.

Editing to add- I just feel so overwhelmed and angry all the time. I know that being overwhelmed is normal considering I have three tiny kids, but I feel like the way that I feel is not normal. I feel like everything is the end of the world and the tiniest thing just sets me off. I don’t have a support system. It’s just me and my husband. His family is more involved than mine, mine is not involved at all. But all of his family works full-time and only wants to be involved when it’s easy and fun. So I never have a babysitter, and I never have a break, so I need suggestions that aren’t “take some time for yourself” stuff like that because it’s just not possible.",yypcxp,1,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yypcxp/help/,parenting
672,To get a cat or to not to.,"To prefix this my husband and I had a dog and a cat before kids. They both passed away before our second child was born, since then we haven't had any pets in the house. 

We have backyard chickens (my ""pets""/project) and just recently adopted two barn/ferral cats (my idea because of the chipmunk problem we have) that will live in our garage/barn.  We live in a neighborhood, just on a large lot.  The barn cats have slowly warmed up to us and one will occasionally let us pet him.  

My kids and my husband have wanted an indoor pet for years, but I've said no because ALL of the responsibilities would land on me and dealing with all the pet hair.  Recently because of the barn cats, I've slowly warmed up to the idea of adopting an indoor cat. 

I brought it up at dinner and my husband is on board with idea. My oldest two kids are 9 and 8, and I think they could handle doing the simple tasks of feeding and cleaning the litter box.  

I want my kids to have a pet, I truly do. And now that all my kids are out of diapers it could be a real possibility. 

I'm just worried that over time said cat will become my sole responsibility because this is what happened before with our last pets between my husband and I. Everything was on me. 

Do I just go and adopt a pet and roll with it? Or just stick with what we have? 

Also any tips on how to deal with pet hair if we go through with is?",yyomhe,0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yyomhe/to_get_a_cat_or_to_not_to/,parenting
673,Wife insists on arguing in front of kids and always needs to win,"Wife insists on arguing in front of my 2 kids and always needs to win - almost never resolves, compromises, or sees other pov. Ranges from small to larger issues. 

As the more empathetic partner, if I screw up, I apologise quickly and try to end it fast. However, on many occasions, when there were grey areas or when she was plain mistaken, I’ve tried various strategies from giving in, middle grounding - verbally stating I see her point, to standing my ground. Unfortunately the latter invariably leads to a blow up, where I walk away for any end to the confrontation as she is for the most incapable of resolving conflicts and needs to win. 

As this happens I keep thinking of the kids short and long term hurt. This situation grates on me and has almost left me drained and empty, relationship wise. At this point I just want the kids to grow up trauma free. Honestly I feel like I’ve been on the end of quite a lot of emotional and verbal abuse. 

She grew up in abusive, argumentative parent situations which led to a divorce. She doesn’t acknowledge her anger and conflict issues so any suggestion of a therapist is shot down. She’s intelligent and somewhat manipulative, successful at a career I’ve always been supportive of. I work a slightly more flexible, decently paid(but lower than her) job, and have been physically closer to the kids - pretty much showered them and changed their diapers since day 1 for 5 years, give lots of hugs kisses and affection, and do most of their driving around etc

I’m sometimes resentful my hands on dad attitude and willingness to prioritise kids time is taken for granted. Weird reverse sexism at play here, since in an argument she stated one day about her earning more justifying more time at work therefore it’s fair I do the driving round etc, which is weird since I pay (pretty equally) my share of the house and bills, groceries, kids classes, meals. And its a vicious cycle since I spend less time focusing on my career which makes it harder for me to advance it.

675,Can't make friends as immigrant parents,"Hi dear reddit parents 

My wife and 3 years old son came to Germany last year.
I'm a student and my wife also wanted to continue her studies.
Since our arrival we have a lot of difficulties socializing and finding friends, which makes us so lonely and somehow depressed.

The problem is that our city is a small city which means we have less people from our origin country to be friends with and even if we have someone they don't want to hang out with us , which I assume being a parent is part of that we can't be in most of their fun or parties or they might think we ruin it.

We had a couple of families that we could find to hang out but again they eventually left our city for a better job , etc 

We also don't know much German so we can't communicate with German parents as well 

Before being parent in our own country we didn't have much problem, me and my wife was not very social but we had our friends, parties ..

But now we find it super difficult to have some friends, we even sometime push , we invite people we ask them to tell us when they are together but not much of a success by now

677,Premie development,"Hey! My daughter was born a month early and I’ve noticed slight discrepancies in her physical milestones/gross motor skills (fine motor skills seem to be fine, oddly) vs her cognitive skills. She has walked/crawled “on time” for her age (crawled just after 9 months and started walking when she was almost 13 months) but her cognitive/language skills seem leaps and bounds ahead. I’ve included a non exhaustive list of what I mean by cognitive/language skills below. But I guess I’m just curious if any other premie parents noticed a similar discrepancy, if it’s something I should be worried about, or things I can do at home to encourage her motor skills to “catch up”? Or does she seem on track and I’m just overly focused on potential delays because she was born a premie? Thanks 😊

679,I am freaking out... advice please,"I am freaking out inside but maintain calm outside.

So here is what happened. Yesterday evening my daughter (6) was talking to me (bed time talk) and she mentioned something like 'you should never let a stranger touch you'. Sometimes I don't quite understand her words, so I kind of ignored her. 

Today afternoon I got a call from her school (a small private school), and the headmistress informed that a fellow kid asked her to touch his private parts yesterday and my daughter said no and that kid asked her not to tell the teacher. Today the same kid tried it with another boy and that  boy complained to the teacher. She said she has the situation under control and there is nothing to worry about it , blah blah blah.

It was only last week I thought my daughter is happy in the school and I should let her continue. This incident makes me rethink. Should I continue the same school?

680,Your thoughts re: one parent talking with their kids about issues with their spouse?,"My wife and I have been married for 25 years. Most of it has been happy. However, about 5 years ago we went through a brief separation. No cheating or abuse or money problems. Nothing major. Just stagnation.

We have four kids and at the time our oldest was 19 and our youngest was 10. It was scary for them and I know it was hard on the whole family. My wife and I worked things out and the last 5 years have been mostly good. Much less bickering and more peace in the home.

But my wife has never really forgiven me for putting her (and the family) through that. It broke her heart when I said that I thought we should think about divorce and it’s pretty clear some kind of trust was broken between us. 

I later discovered that during the time of our separation, my wife talked to our oldest daughter (17 at the time) about her feelings and, whenever we got into an argument or she was upset about what was going on, she would confide in our daughter. This has put a permanent strain on my relationship with my daughter. 

She is 21 now and is sweet when she needs something from me, but otherwise treats me with disdain and accuses me of “traumatizing” and ""abusing"" her as a child and pretty much ruining her life. She believes her dropping out of college and smoking weed all day and over-drinking and not holding down a job is my fault. It’s as convenient an excuse as any, I suppose. Let me be clear: I never once laid a hand on her. I yelled but rarely lost my temper. Almost never swore.

My youngest daughter idolizes her older sister, so now her views of me are also being tainted by my oldest daughter’s perceptions of me. 

It turns out my wife has continued to confide in one or both of them when we argue or if I say something that makes her feel bad. I don’t think she talks shit. I just think she vents and talks about her feelings. But I am convinced that this is doing serious damage to my relationship with my girls, and, consequently, with my wife. 

We have spoken about this issue many times. I have explained that airing our dirty laundry to our kids is destructive for them and for us. I don’t think honesty is a bad thing, but there are just certain things that a parent shouldn’t discuss with their children. She knows how strongly I feel about this. She has agreed not to do it anymore. I don’t think she sees the harm, but she knows it bothers me. She says she only does it when they can tell she's upset and ask her what's wrong.

But because she doesn’t really agree with me, she has continued doing so on occasion. It happened twice during a family vacation this summer and again a few nights ago. In all instances, the fallout from the girls was bad enough that I really felt hurt and ganged-up on and misunderstood. And angry. I have told my wife that I don’t know if I can stay in this relationship anymore. She has broken my trust too many times for me to ignore and it’s clearly not stopping. 

Since I don’t want to air my dirty laundry with those close to me and suck them into the vortex of our issues (and become a hypocrite), I thought this might be a good place to seek wisdom. 

I know in my soul that sharing spousal problems with your children is a major taboo. But how bad is this? Am I over-reacting? 

I now work from home. My wife has never worked. My oldest daughter, her partner (female) and my youngest daughter all live at home with me. I feel extremely alone and despised in the home I worked so hard to provide for them. I would greatly appreciate anyone’s thoughts on this.

683,12 year old smoked weed pen,"I have a daughter who is 12 years old and in 7th grade. Her best friend has an older brother who is a freshman in high school and I believe he is 14. I know he smokes cigarettes and his mother knows as well. She smokes too. No one in our family smokes though. My daughter and I have a very close relationship unlike I had with my mom. She tells me everything and completely trusts me. She slept at her best friends house Monday and Tuesday night since her best friend lives across from their school and they had a big project to work on together. We also live very close too plus her mom is a teacher at their school and is her cheerleading coach so I do not mind when she stays over there on school nights sometimes. My daughter came home last night and told me she had something to tell me but she didn’t want me to get mad. I was just about to put my son to sleep when she wanted to talk. She told me that she hit a weed pen (it’s like a vape but is has THC oil. I was shocked and obviously really upset when she told me this but I did not freak out. I asked her where she did this at and with who. She told me it was her best friends older brothers weed pen and that she and her friend both smoked the pen. I’m going to be honest here because I do believe this is extremely important. I struggled with drug addiction for a few years. I have been clean for many years now and live a completely sober lifestyle. I don’t even drink alcohol and neither does my husband. I tried hard drugs at the young age of 14 because I was with a girl I desperately wanted to be friends with and she was doing it. My ex husband also struggled and still does struggle with addiction and our parents did too as well so she has addiction on both sides of her family. Drugs ruined my life for a long time and I am EXTREMELY blessed to have been pulled out of the pits of hell and given another chance. A lot of my friends are dead now because of drugs. I want to be extremely careful how I approach this with her as I do not want to risk her not coming to me anymore. My biggest fear is that my children will suffer with addiction. I am terrified of this! I have been very honest and open with my kids about the dangers of using drugs and alcohol. It’s not like it used to be when I was growing up. It’s extremely dangerous for kids today to experiment due to drugs like even weed being laced with things like fentanyl. We have a very good home life here. My daughter is loved by many and she knows this. We live on a military base and are surrounded by other decent families. She is a straight A student, is on the cheerleading team, has tons of good friends, has always been very well behaved in and out of school, and this is VERY out of character for her. I told her last night that I would talk to her today about it because I had no idea what to say or how to act. I need guidance. Is there any other parents of teens who can give me some advice? I am going to talk with her after school today about this but I don’t want to make the same mistakes my mother did.

684,3 MO spits out pacifier and wakes up all night,"Had another rough night last night and I’m about to lose my everloving mind. My 3 month/13-week old is a pacifier lover. We use it to fall asleep for naps and bedtime but also to calm down during the day. She has had a strong oral fixation since birth.

We have been playing along as pacifier reinsertion specialists but the last few nights have been a kicker. After her first longish stretch (~4-5 hours), either I or my husband is up with her seemingly every 1.5 hours to either feed (every 3 hours) or replace binky, because she wakes up crying for it. I should mention the same thing happens for naps… she typically won’t sleep longer than 45 min at a time. However, she is a champ at going down “drowsy but awake.”

I’m not sure what to do. She is still swaddled so she can’t self soothe with hands or find a new binky in the crib (and honestly she’s not developmentally there yet anyway). I want to get rid of these pacis so she’ll stop waking up but I am absolutely terrified of the process of taking them away from her, and I like the SIDS protection.

685,Bum Rash 4 Year Old,My daughter is 4 and has this bum rash. I haven't really seen this kind before. I'm taking her in but couldn't get her in till next week.

686,Bro it is so much easier to parent toddlers while high as fuck,"Bruh I'm in my early 30s and do NOT have the energy to keep up with my 18 month old.

Btw my lovely husband is sober we always have one sober parent on hand in case of emergency.

It was also a long ass day. Toddlers are like tiny drunk people, our toddler is in his ""lick and climb everything"" phase. 

ANYWAYS. Dinner goes smoothly, it always goes smoothly because I am the head chef in the house and all my cooking is delicious. Our son eats everything and anything that I cooked. If he pulls some toddler shit and suddenly hates something he ate a million times before, we add a dash of sprinkles and suddenly it is ""magic food"". Magic food is 100000x more delicious and toddlers are the most gullible people I have ever met.

Why I'm high, I get the giggles and the munchies. Our son thinks it is so funny when I laugh when I eat. He wants to join in on the fun and starts eating and then giggling with me.

And then afterwards he wants to dance and play after dinner. We always join because it makes him tired and sleep through the night. I am way more down to dancing if I feel fuzzy on the inside.

Bathtime is easier because my husband and I have a rule. Whomever is high has to kneel and whomever is the babysitter gets the sitter. We hate kneeling on the bathroom floor and take turns, but when you are high your knees don't hurt. My husband will be sitting on the sitter (toilet) more comfy like to watch me and our son.

If you are going to get high, you need to do it responsibly. Just like those who take a glass of wine at night, it makes your judgement not so sharp so you need to be there incase of accidents.

And we do go over weed safety with the kid. Our pantry is like 20 feet long, the bottom two shelf's are alllllllll his snacks. At the very top and in the back are the adult snacks. We go through it as much as possible. Do you eat snacks from your shelf? Yes! Can adults have your snacks? No! Do we eat from our shelf? Yes! Can you have our snacks? No! But if you do and feel funny, can you alert an adult? Yes!

That is the shelf where we hide our Oreos.

We ordered a special size safe and it has been in the mail since forever, but when it comes we are slamming those bad boys in there for extra safety. 

I can't wait until our son is a teenager and trying to pretend he ain't high as fuck around us. Or the day he steals our weed and act like he got away with it. 

Also bedtime is pretty easy. I'm kinda just vibing here with my heating pad of a kid on me while I relax with him on this rocking chair while my husband reads us a story. 

Also psa don't name your cars. My husband and I car name is Tursla and our son thinks she is a real member of the family and wants to say goodnight to Tursla every night. Same thing with Robi the automatic vacuum cleaner. 

But that weird little ritual is hell lot more tolerable on Mary Jane. 

Along with children's shows and movies on repeat. Ever seen the show Little Bear? Ducky is annoying AS FUCK.

688,I forgot about the only sad part about bringing home a new baby,"I had forgotten until just recently that when I had my second child, I came home from the hospital and picked up my first child, who was two at the time, to give him a hug. I remembered that he suddenly felt so heavy and so big compared to the newborn I’d been snuggling non-stop the previous few days. He didn’t feel like my baby any longer and felt like a full-on child. 

My second has been The Baby for the past three years, and even though she’s fully in the toddler years now, and even though she weighs a little over 30 pounds, she’s been the smaller one and my first has been the bigger one. 

But a week ago we brought home Baby #3 and it happened all over again. I went to pick my second child up to sit her on my lap and read a book and she suddenly just felt so heavy and so large, and not like my little baby anymore. 

I know it’s fueled by the post partum hormones and everything but it just made me so sad how my children are growing so fast and time just will not slow down. I’m grateful they’re still ages and sizes where I still *can* pick them up but it was a sudden harsh reminder that they won’t stay that way forever.",yxe51s,507,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yxe51s/i_forgot_about_the_only_sad_part_about_bringing/,parenting

692,15 month old sleeping issues. Recently found out wife is pregnant and seeking help,"Background:

She is still breastfed to sleep - major issue we know and are working on weening but nothing else seems to work.

She eats 3+ solid meals a day

Wife does not believe in sleep training 

Has had less then 5x 9 hour stretches of sleep. On average she is up 2-10x a night. 

Traditionally sleeps in crib but wife will bring her to our bed during very difficult nights.

She will not accept dad to even get her back to sleep and will just scream until mom comes in. This has been one of our only methods to be able to get her to sleep sometimes. 

We just recently found out my wife is pregnant again and we have to start taking some bigger steps here so my wife can rest comfortably. I’m perfectly fine with letting her start to cry it out and ween off breast feeding but my wife is not. Recently my wife has been working towards no more night feeds and we started making progress and then time change and 1 year shots have just destroyed any progress and we’re struggling to get her back to sleeping at night.

Has anyone faced the same or similar situation? Are we just doomed and did this completely wrong?

I have gone to therapy and have a (lapsed) prescription for a low dose antidepressant from when I lost a pregnancy two years ago, but the rage was definitely there before, and still persists. 

I know my workload and my spouses work schedule is definitely contributing to the frequency, but is not the cause.  I am considering leaving my job to stay home with the kids, but a big thing holding me back is my rage.  I don't lose it at work, or with friends, or other family besides my spouse on a much less frequent occasion.

695,Toddler climbed out of pack n play,"My little one is 26 months and just climbed out of the pack n play at grandma’s house. We put her back in and she did it again (and subsequently did not nap and was terribly exhausted). She has not tried to climb out of her crib at home at this point, but I imagine that will come soon? I’ve been hoping to keep her in her crib and delay transition to a toddler bed as long as possible. 

She has been home with me for several months as I’ve been on summer break (am a teacher) and then maternity leave now with our newborn, so she’s exclusively been in her crib and not a pack n play for a long time. However, she will be going to a new in-home daycare soon and will need a sleeping arrangement. I had planned to just send her pack n play. But now what? The babysitter just puts pack n plays in the bedrooms of her house for little ones. I know day cares often use cots? How would I train her to use this?

700,How to protect child from possible sexual assault in family?,"
I believe I’ve been very naive. I have heard so many horror stories about dads, grandfathers and uncles that seemingly were nice guys but were sexually assaulting little ones in their family in secret. I know there’s only so much you can do but I want to be vigilant and protect my children, even if I am being overprotective, rather be safe than sorry.

Backstory:
3-4 years ago, my husband’s sister told me that her stepdad had been making sexual advances towards her from the age 16/17 to 21, unknown to everyone else in the family. He stopped one day and mildly apologized while bring up barely 18 “hotties” in Vegas he’s slept with. She begged me not to tell anyone, especially my husband’s mom. This was while I was still dating my husband, for 2 years I held it in and was so repulsed by the guy. Then I told my husband one night and unfortunately sort of dismissed it and that was that. Few times since, it has come up between my husband and I only or even with his sister present and my husband says it’s bad but lmake it seem serious enough to act on it. Sister in law also told her mom’s best friend and she hasn’t done anything or told MIL to my knowledge. And unfortunately, I have since grown to know said step father in law and appreciate him as a person. But I will never, ever trust him. And I never want my daughter alone with him. 

There are other things that raise a flag about the situation. With sis in law, on multiple occasions I’ve seen her do things around stepdad that don’t make sense. I’ve seen her change her shirt in front of stepdad with a see-through lace bra underneath (can visibly see her full breast) and she knows he’s staring right at her ( me and him were in the kitchen with her and she was facing us) I’ve seen her wear extremely revealing bikinis around him and bend over with her butt facing him, like 5 feet away. I’ve seen her do other things that don’t align with her fear and disgust for him and don’t know what to do about it. 

With stepfather in law, he used to make comments to me while drunk such as, “oh you are so hot” and things alike years ago but stopped after a couple of times because I showed him I don’t appreciate that and made sure to never be alone with him. He also has said and done some things that raise more flags for me. For one, he always has to touch/adjust his genitalia, doesn’t matter if he’s in a room full of women or men, he will nonchalantly grab that area multiple times like he has an itch or something. 

He also has a 12 year old daughter from a previous marriage. One day, he, I and  his daughter were talking about something and he brings up one of her friends out of nowhere, then makes a point to say the friend is very developed and shapely for a girl her age. I shut the conversation down immediately and tell him that’s inappropriate.
Another time, all the family was together, including husband’s mom, and some friends were together. He comes from out of the blue and says loud enough for everyone to hear, “ hey (my name) just let me know what I need to do for (my daughters name) when she wants to go on her potty so I can take her for you.” My daughter was 10 months at the time and I do elimination communication with her since 6 weeks so yes she does use the potty but NEVER have I asked or alluded that I needed his help ever. 

I don’t know what to do about all this. This is all so sketchy. Especially because MIL wants to babysit all the time and spend time with her everyday but I don’t trust her to protect her. Mother in law will let my daughter( now 1 year old) climb into stepFIL’s lap while rubbing her face and grabbing at his genitals to get leverage and she doesn’t even bat an eye at it. And of course StepFIL allows it. I always grab her when I see it but I know I can only trust mother in law to an extent. If I told her to never leave her with anyone she wouldn’t listen to me when I’m not around. I can not trust her to keep her word from things she’s done in the past. My husband would kill stepFIL if he did something to our daughter but unfortunately he’s not very proactive and can be very naive as well. What would you do?

Edit: I’ve done my best to read through all the responses. Thank you to each of you for taking the time to read my post and give me quality advice. Again, I admit I’ve been extremely naive and passive. I am only to blame for my inaction and I am doing what I can to turn away from that. This morning I sent a message to SIL about this and apologized for basically sweeping this under the rug. My husband and I also had a long talk, uncovered many things that will help in the talk we plan to have with his mother soon. We are thankfully mostly on the same page about this. 

As someone has stated, sFIL has been bad on some days and good on other days. I need to look at what he’s done and set firm boundaries based on that instead of “appreciating him as a person.” I fell into that trap and I should have not. He has helped me and my husband a lot throughout the years but that does not negate the evil he’s done and could potentially do to my child. When I got to know him more, it was before the comments he made about his daughter’s friend and about taking my daughter to the potty. I also forgot to mention that when he was 12, sFIL’s babysitter had sex with him. He needs serious help and that’s the bottom line.

Edit2: SIL accepted my message, but I’m concerned by some of her response. She said sFIL is out of control but won’t ever act on anything.. She also said she is 1000% sure her mom would protect my daughter even though she admitted to MIL not protecting her. She also said all the therapy she’s had over the years has helped her and she’s in a much better place now ( but all the sexual things she’s done that I mentioned above happened AFTER she went to therapy for years and she still does when she comes to town) I feel like SIL wouldn’t entirely back me up if I outed this info to MIL and my husband unfortunately thinks some of sFIL’s behaviors is subconscious because sFIL is kind of moronic. This is all a joke honestly. I have full intentions on keeping my daughter away from him but it’s hard to know I will be probably virtually ostracized for doing so, even by SIL. They think sFIL is just a little perverted but nothing to be concerned about at this point but obviously that’s not the case.

705,Son is 2 different kids,"My son (5) is a great kid. But there is a growing discrepancy with the way he acts with me vs his mother. His attitude is becoming a problem at school when I'm working in the sense that he's more combative when his mum does the school run. 

I have an agreeable and productive child. His mum gets constant fights over the little things, from waking him up to putting him to bed. The school are fantastic in their communication and keep us updated with how he is in the form of a behavior book, which is where I saw the true extent of the problem. 

Fundamentally, neither of us are doing anything differently from a disciplinary standpoint but he seems to act up only when I'm at work. Any ideas on what we can do to bridge the gap? I don't have any tips as we're apparently raising different kids. 

When I inevitably have to punish him he seemingly understands and accepts it but after a period of being a model child he reverts back to the attitude. 

If it makes a difference we're a single household and despite not being married, very much a close/ affectionate family. Any advice? His mum is a star and doesn't let any of this affect her but I'm not gonna let my son grow up with no respect for his mother.

708,help me understand my partners thinking on our sons birthday next month,"It's our sons 3rd birthday next month. We have never had a get together celebration for his birthday because of covid so this year I wanted to do something special for him.

 He is peppa obsessed and I found a peppa bouncy castle with slide he would love, and 2 venues that could take us

We don't know that many kids that would attend especially with the time of year his birthday is but but my thinking is even if one or 2 show up our son will have a ball and would adore a peppa bouncy castle even if it is just him on it 😄!

My partner doesn't want me to organise this, first the issue was money then I said don't worry I'll pay for it all. Now she is saying her mental health is so poor she is overwhelmed at the idea of organising it. 

I said don't worry ill organise everything. She then said that I am making our sons birthday about what I want and not what our son wants, he doesn't know any better he will only be 3. I said if he could talk and choose I really think he would choose this! He is peppa mad and adores bouncy castles!


 . She is still insisting we do something just the 4 of us (including our youngest daughter) and not the party idea because of her poor mental health and doesn't want to be around anyone else

709,Kid keeps commenting on my 5 year old's lunch,"One little girl in my kid's K class keeps commenting on my daughter's lunch and now its affecting what I can send her to school with.

First, she called her a baby since I was sending her with fruit/veg pouches. Now my kid refuses to eat pouches anymore (which is annoying because I just spent $150 on a bunch of gourmet flavored ones and it was the best way for me to sneak in veggies because she's not a big veggie eater).

Last week she told her that pickles were gross and that she was ""weird"" for liking pickles. Now one of my kid's favorite foods is suddenly a no go.

Today my kid explicitly asked for boiled eggs for lunch, but then got sad on the way to drop off that she knew the same kid would insult her as apparently ""eggs are nasty"".

I couldn't think up a great way to shut it down, so spur of the moment, we practiced ""\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ keep your thoughts to your self"".

Any advice on what she can say?

&#x200B;

Update: I appreciate all of your responses!  Mean kid wasn't at school today, so her whole lunch was eaten and my lovely daughter was in a good mood.  I did text the teacher and ask her to look out for it but specifically asked that my daughter not be mentioned.  I remember being in grade 1 and having my parents make a big deal out of an issue and it made even more kids pick on me, and that's precisely why I wanted to have my daughter be able to stand on her own two feet.  We got some great one liners as well - we live in a culture where kids can have some pretty witty/spicy comebacks so I'm hoping a combination of communicating with my daughter about how everyone likes different foods and there's no need to make any changes, the teacher paying attention (her whole grade only has 8 kids and they eat lunch at their classroom table) and then a comeback or two will pull this right back around.   

Overall my kid absolutely loves school, so I didn't want anything to mar that for her.",ywyby6,1076,369,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ywyby6/kid_keeps_commenting_on_my_5_year_olds_lunch/,parenting

I took her to the er because she was retracting pretty bad and had labored breathing (we are home now)… anyways we were there for about 6 hours. She was a snotty mess as any child is right now. Coughing. Exhausted because she can’t breathe and won’t sleep at night not to mention it was 11pm. Anyways. We were getting discharged and I don’t know if it was small talk or what but the nurse was like “do you bathe her everyday?”…. I’m like every other. Like yeah she had dried snot that I tried to clean up the best I could. She had dirt under her nails because it was bath night and she’s a crawler. Like I’m just confused? I feel like I looked like a bad mom. Not to also mention- she bit her lip the other day. It bled a little. Scab came off right before the nurse came in and the nurse was like “you know she has something on her face right?”

712,3 year old showing defiance at school. How to keep things positive?,"My 3.5 year old son has been in preschool two days a week since early September. He LOVES it and besides a little potty training blip early on, he’s been doing wonderful. I’ve seen so much growth in him. 

Recently at home he’s been going through some tough stages with the biggest being a constant need for control and power. We’ve had a great breakthrough and we’ve managed to give him areas that are appropriate for a 3 year old to control. He still pushes back at times but is starting to grasp the boundaries we’ve placed. 

He is now pushing these boundaries at school, I’m assuming because he knows he can’t at home anymore and because he’s becoming more comfortable at school. He refuses to acknowledge his teacher’s instruction, tells her he doesn’t want to sit down or line up, rips his coat off after she puts it on him, etc. He isn’t being aggressive or nasty, just quietly defiant. She is great to redirect him and she’s holding those boundaries right. 

I’d love to work through some conversations with him over our weekend before he goes back to school, but I don’t want to shame him or make him feel terrible about treating his teacher badly. He knows right from wrong and he knows what he’s supposed to do. He is just being the ding dong 3 year old that he is lol. I understand fully that this is all 100% developmentally appropriate, but I also want to help his poor teacher out and work through this with him instead of just letting things take their time.

714,How to help a child develop empathy in relation to kiddos with additional needs?,"My step-daughter is 10 years old. She frequently comes home upset about the perceived “special treatment” of other children at her school who have additional needs. Things like them having an aide in class to help them, having extra time or conditions around tasks such as movement/snack breaks, or physical items like those wobble seats. A majority of the things she gets upset about are assisting children with “invisible” conditions like ASD, etc - especially when they appear to be “high functioning” - but she has also been upset about a child with a sight impairment having a special iPad to assist them with their learning.

I’ve tried being empathetic with her and acknowledging that it feels unfair when someone gets something she thinks looks fun, or when she has to wait her turn for help if she needs it when someone else has someone to help right away - but she’s also a very neurotypical kid who doesn’t need a whole lot of extra support to keep up with her peers, and I think it’s important for her to understand why things are different for some people. In addition, her mom’s new partner has a son around her age who has additional needs and she’s having a lot of trouble adjusting to him too - her mom thinks she’s actually deliberately trying to upset her partner’s son sometimes, and we’ve had similar feedback from her classroom teacher as well.

The conversations I have attempted with her about equity vs equality (aka: people getting what they need rather than everyone getting the same) haven’t really made a difference.

Anybody have any suggestions? I am out of ideas and honestly haven’t really needed to worry about this kind of thing, as my own daughter has always been quite sensitive about this kind of thing (she actually wants to be a special needs teacher) so I’m not sure how to “teach” empathy/understanding about this.",yxnlya,21,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yxnlya/how_to_help_a_child_develop_empathy_in_relation/,parenting

719,I think my tween would like Barbies for Christmas but is too embarrassed to ask.,"My 11 year old (12 in January) is a mix between girly and a tomboy. She loves wrestling, judo, skateboarding, and softball but also likes cheerleading and makeup. She is a perfectly normal tween girl with good friendships and really looks up to her older siblings, while also spending a good amount of time with her younger sister. 

My youngest is 8 and has always been super into Barbies and LOL dolls. She has a whole town in the basement of dolls houses. She had a lot of Barbies but over the years some have gotten damaged or are just overused. My 11 year old plays with her a lot and they tend to argue over the same Barbies. They figure it out and can play together after arguing but it is pretty much the same thing everyday. I am getting the 8 year old a few more Barbies for Christmas and was thinking about getting some for the 11 year old too. That way they can have their own Barbies and my 8 year old won't play the, ""Well they are all my Barbies"" card anymore. When I brought this up to my 11 year old by herself she said she would be ""okay"" with getting Barbies but a few days later changed her mind and said she doesn't want them anymore. She said, ""It isn't like I really want to play with them. I only play with them with (8 year old). I don't need my own."" That is fine but, again, today they fought about the Barbies again and I really think the 11 year old wants a couple but is too embarrassed to ask for some reason.

722,Is this typical for peds occupational therapy?,"We had our first visit today with my 22 month old for a possible sensory processing disorder and I'm just left with unease about this place. I'm curious if this is normal for others' experience or if we should be looking elsewhere. My main concerns are: 

The therapy session was in a large room with two other children also receiving therapies at that time. It was very distracting and overwhelming with all the noise (one of the children was nonverbal and used a running vacuum to calm/refocus), and with all the play equipment out my daughter kept flitting from one station to another which made it super hard to keep up and focus on anything the OT was asking me or trying to explain. 

They pulled out a variety of noisy Vtech type toys for my daughter to play with while I was trying to complete paperwork and field questions from the OT. My daughter doesn't play with these types of toys much and gets overwhelmed with the noise/lights easily, which made it seems like an odd choice to pull out for a sensory concern visit. 

The OT seemed more concerned with my daughter's W-stance and poor core strength, as well as assessing her overall motor skill capabilities than addressing her aggressive urges. The way OT was brought up to me by our pediatrician was that it could help channel her biting urges into other healthier behaviors, so I was just left wondering if this is typical for a first visit or no. There's only 2 reviews on google for this practice and it seems newer; everyone was very welcoming and kind to us but I just don't know what to expect I guess.",yy3r7p,2,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yy3r7p/is_this_typical_for_peds_occupational_therapy/,parenting

Her mother has strong narcissistic tendencies. She is very active on social media, with thousands of followers and online friends. A perfect social media image is very important to her.

My daughter was threatened punishment over her consistent refusal to install Snapchat on her phone. My daughter was 9 at that time. Her mother's argument was that Snapchat would enable our daughter to stay in touch with family and friends who were postng stuff on snapchat. While my daughter was protesting, she did not want to chat to these people, who were mostly strangers to her. In the end I had to ask my daughter to just install and the app and disable notifications, just so that her mother would stop.

My daughter, now 13, is generally an introverted person. She has social media accounts, mainly because of the pressure from her mother, but she does not post. However, her mother is constantly posting stuff related to our daughter and love bombing her online. I feel this is a form of domination from her mother and not healthy.

I feel like my daughter has difficulty making even small decisions for herself. If given a choice, she would look at other's for clues or approval. I think this is because her mother is like a bulldozer, there are no healthy boundaries.

725,This is for you,"If you’re a parent whose kid is sick and is calling for you too many times to count tonight, and you’re trying to help them sleep but they’re miserable- I’m sending you solidarity and wishing your kid gets well very soon. 

If you’re a parent and you feel increasingly isolated from how you would love to be right now and your hobbies and friends because life is just a little crazy and hard right now - I’m sending you compassionate thoughts and, eventually, the little ones will grow up and be more independent and it’ll all get a little easier. 

If you’re a parent and today was just one of those days where you couldn’t meet anyones expectations, I’m hoping you’ll be kind and generous with yourself and be proud that you did what you could do with what you have.. anyone who matters should and will understand eventually. 

If you’re on parental leave and work is coming up and you have no clue how you’ll manage it all , we’ll figure it out as we go along. This will be the new normal for a while. Itll be different and hard , and painful to be away from the little one , but if it is necessary , then it is necessary , even if it isn’t a financial question, it might still be necessary and that’s ok. 

If you’re a stay at home parent and the dishes are piling up and the laundry is a mess and the food on the table isn’t nutritionist approved , give yourself a warm hug and a smile in the mirror, everyday is a 24 hour work day for you and you take rest where you can and you prioritize what you want.

If you’re paying more than should be fair for daycare and somehow the little one is always sick at home and work isn’t understanding when you have no other choice but to be there for your child , maybe some day basic social needs will be met fairly and flexibly for all families.. in the meantime I’m wishing you patience and immunity that gets stronger and stronger every day.

If you have no idea what you are doing most of the time, and you are exhausted all of the time just know there’s a giant club of people just like you and we all recognize the value of the work you are putting in , and the tremendous power of the love you are providing even when you are simply brushing your lips on your child’s forehead to test for a fever or cutting a fruit just right for your baby.

735,Guilt removing child out of daycare,"I just want to ask for some advice on something we are struggling with currently. A couple months ago my family moved to another town closer to my work. Because of the move, we had to take our 2yo out of the daycare he had been in for over a year. We were unable to find immediate childcare in our new town, but my wife had planned to keep him at home while she worked temporarily until we could get him enrolled. Of all the facilities we toured, we narrowed it down to two. 
One we loved, but was told the waitlist for toddlers was several months long (into March). The second was acceptable, but not great, but had an opening that we could immediately put our child into. 

We decided to get him on the waitlist for one and enroll him in the other, and if we decided we really didn’t like where he was at, we would make the switch when the time came. He has been in the new daycare for two weeks now, but we got notification that our first choice had an opening and we could start him there next week. We feel guilty for several reasons. First, the daycare he is in now seems fine. Despite the facility being a little dated, the teachers seem nice and we like the smaller class sizes and activities they do with the kids. Second, he is finally getting used to going and having a routine, is getting attached to the faculty, etc. Also we feel guilty because the staff seems to have taking a liking to him and have done a great job of making him feel comfortable. It just feels like a crummy thing to do.

738,How important is humidity-level in the Winter?,"First time parent here, and I'm wondering how important humidity-level is for infants. I know it's recommended to use a humidifier when babies are sick, but what I'm wondering is: does humidity-level matter outside of that?

I've seen some sites state a good range for humidity for babies is 40-60% and others that say 30-50%. We live in a drafty house and on some Fall/Winter days, like today, the humidity level in our house is about 35%. It definitely feels a little dry, and I'm not sure if we need to be using a humidifier to raise the humidity level even though our little one (6 months) is healthy.",yy4xvx,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yy4xvx/how_important_is_humiditylevel_in_the_winter/,parenting
739,Baby pukes when given amoxicillin (immediately due to flavor I’m guessing),"Headline says it all. My 5.5mo has an ear infection and vomits every time we give him amoxicillin. It’s an immediate reaction due to the flavor or his gag reflex I’m guessing. We’ve tried:

Squirting it in his cheeks
Squirting it down his throat
Giving it to him 1) sitting up, 2) laying down, 3) holding him slightly reclined and bouncing gently

He won’t take a pacifier so the pacifier method is out, and he has been refusing bottles (nursing only). Also, it smells like fruit punch so idk if the pharmacy flavored it or something, but it stinks.

740,Sorry to vent but each year it is getting to me more and more…,"So, when I was with my ex, (we have two boys together) I always made sure Christmas was magical for the kids when they were younger,….not too OTT but we believed in Santa, the run up I tried to make exciting, we wrote Christmas lists, decorated the tree together… we tracked Santa and the kids asked for a elf on the shelf (this I tried to avoid but did it for my kids lol) Christmas Day and Boxing Day were swapped each year between families, if at ours I’d do extra gifts and games etc to make it fun and to make a long holiday more bearable… my ex always said it was false fun…. he used to be a right Scrooge (by his own admission)… even his mum and dad used to hate Christmas but having small kids (their first grandchildren) I tried to make it a memorable time for all…
Now we have separated and divorced he and his now fiancée whom he had an emotional affair with, and who is a lot younger than him, and have lots of money, rent a house each Christmas and new year, have lots of family fun times games and he now loves Christmas…. and so do his parents… where I now dread it….I try and make it special, I used to love Christmas, but now as the kids are older I feel deflated… I’m still single…..by choice, I’ve not met anyone yet that I feel will be good for me or my kids…I hate not having them the whole time over the Christmas break but obviously accept they have to see their dad too but my family don’t help, I’ve always been the one in my family to get everyone together, to entertain and organise and quite frankly I’m exhausted…. so now I’m at a point where I feel my kids would rather be with their dad…. the old Scrooge lol…. last Christmas I would have quite happily stayed in bed all day with my dog and watched movies as the kids were with their dad…. my family made Christmas feel like a chore, no one really wanted to be there and it was awful.
This year we’re at my mums….with my kids, my eldest has to work first thing Boxing Day so I’ll be driving back Christmas night. Boxing Day I’ll be in my own.

742,Child Depression Resources,"My daughter was just diagnosed with depression (7yo). She has been in therapy for a while because we has been struggling with sad feelings and self regulation since some time but recently got very intense. Suicide ideation was coming up often so we took her to a child psychiatrist (by recommendation of her pediatrician). 

Dr. decided to give her a low dose of sertraline (10mg/day) and it seemed it help for the first couple of weeks, then she became very impulsive and angry and basically uncontrollable. We believe the sertraline might have caused this, Dr is unsure due the low dose but to be safe she recommended discontinue for now. She is now in clonidine to calm her down first as safety measure, it has helped on that but she still sad/depressed.

I am looking for resources, I would like to understand all kind of treatments and options so I can be on top of the recommendations from the doctor. If the doctor recommends certain medication I would like to be already familiar and ask the right questions instead of just going for it and learn after treatment. I am strongly science oriented person, so anything backed up by science will resonate in my head.

Any books, forums, pages to help us navigate during these dark road? Would be very appreciative to DM with any parents that had gone through similar situations.",yxz4bq,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yxz4bq/child_depression_resources/,parenting
743,Favorite activities to make the holidays more fun?! (Thanksgiving AND Christmas),"So my husband’s deployment has been extended meaning he will not be home for the holidays. Our boys are obviously sad and bummed out so I’m trying to think of something to make the holidays this year more fun. I was thinking about getting tickets to see my parents and spend it with them but they will be leaving the country to visit my grandma so that’s a no go. 

**Thanksgiving**
I’m debating if I should even make a thanksgiving meal? It’ll only be the four of us (17,15,3, and me). I don’t want them to be sad and gloomy while we’re eating because dad isn’t home. Anyone have any activities they do if they don’t celebrate thanksgiving?

**Christmas**
I’m planning to do stockings, hot coco/apple cider, with a big Christmas breakfast then after we’ll open presents. I was thinking about doing like a gingerbread house contest during the day to keep everyone busy then towards the end of the night we’ll watch a bunch of Christmas movies. 

I just don’t want them to feel down since it’s gonna be their first holidays without dad. Not sure if the teens will be into it but I know my 3yr old will. I’m already dealing with these two moody teens who currently hate dad and his work I don’t want my 3yr old to feel the unhappy mood. The last thing I need is 3 unhappy kids while I try to make everything better 🥲

Problem is, my spouse lost his job a few months ago and money is getting a bit tight to say the least. We earned more than the income limit before the job loss, but income now is only ~2k per month or less from side jobs. 

Would we have to go a full year before qualifying? I don't expect things to drag on that long but i wasn't really expecting this, so I'm just grasping at straws a bit.

750,Looking at the stars helped me understand my toddler,"I had this realization this morning as I was facing the usual barrage of toddler questions.  

The other night on my way home from work, the skies were perfectly clear and there was a faint aurora in the distance.  I took 10 minutes, pulled off on a rural side road and just looked in amazement at the stars, the faintly dancing lights and the occasional satellite or something else that transited across the sky.  I've got a basic understanding of astronomy, I know why stars are bright, I know why they twinkle...but there is so much I don't know and on such a grand scale.  Which satellite was that? How far is that star? How many other people are looking at the same thing, wondering the same thing? 

I know the basics of the what and why of the things I saw, but there was so much more to know.  Amazement and curiosity about everything around me.  

And this morning I realized that my 3.5yo sees the world the same way I saw the stars.  Sure, getting asked why for the 27th time in a 2 minute period can wear on me, but realizing that it was because of this same wonder and curiosity.  What I stopped and experienced for 10 minutes is what my kiddo has been living every day.  I hope she can keep this curiosity and inquisitiveness, no matter how annoying it is to explain why snow is cold for the 5th time in a morning....",yxurof,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yxurof/looking_at_the_stars_helped_me_understand_my/,parenting
751,I feel like my wife gives in to our 1 year old too quickly,"Our daughter has just turned 1, and overall she's a wonderful, easy kid so far. But she's a baby, and she's starting to communicate. Usually when she's upset or she wants something, she'll start whining - not words, just an annoyed ""mmmmmmm!"" and maybe pointing at something.

When she does this my wife immediately starts trying to figure out what she wants to get her to stop. She'll grab her toys, get her snacks, pick her up, etc. She clearly gets stressed out by our daughter being upset and want to make her not upset as fast as possible.

Me on the other hand, unless she's actively in distress I don't worry about her whining. I'll try to figure out what it is of course, and I don't ignore her, but if I'm doing something else I'll finish what I'm doing before seeing what she wants. And if she wants something she can't have I just won't let her have it. Basically I think it's ok for her to be annoyed or bored sometimes and feel those feelings. A lot of the time she just needs something that is going to take some time (getting a bottle ready, changing her, putting her to bed) and she's going to just be cranky until she gets that. And that's ok, because once she gets changed/fed/put to bed she'll be fine. She doesn't need constant comforting and toys and whatnot.

But she is only 1 year old, and I don't really know if I'm right about this. I know babies basically can't be coddled enough, and I'm not sure she's old enough yet where she doesn't need constant comforting. I'm not really sure where the line is where you start not giving in to their every want.",yy3hbe,1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yy3hbe/i_feel_like_my_wife_gives_in_to_our_1_year_old/,parenting
752,Advice on toddler behavior,"I’m feeling a little lost. My three year old suddenly has such rude and explosive behavior, which I know is totally normal. I guess I just don’t know how to deal with it. Seems like everything I do doesn’t get through to him or backfires. 

If I put him in timeout he screams bloody murder and destroys his surroundings, throwing anything he can and if there’s nothing, tries to put holes in the wall. If I have him calm down in his room, same thing. I’ve tried swatting his hand (I know, I know…desperate here), yelling, etc. If I take away story time he just gets amped up to ten and gets aggressive and explodes. When he is aggressive, I have tried to hold him close and talk normally to him and tell him, “I’m going to hold you until you calm down so you don’t hurt yourself or others”. That doesn’t work because he thrashed so wildly I can’t hold him down. 

He’s honestly a super sweet boy, sings songs to his sister about how she is special, tells us he loves us 100x a day, etc but this behavior has thrown me for a loop.

753,When is it an appropriate age to give child a tablet?,"Hi, I (F27) have a son (10) (I know, young mom lol) and we had a parent-teacher conference yesterday, his teacher said he wasn’t really meeting the standards on writing (I guess it’s all electronic now) because he isn’t really getting the hang of properly spacing, using spell check, punctuation, etc. 

The only time he uses the iPad is at school during class time, we have him write, physically on paper at home + have taught him cursive since that’s not a thing at school anymore thinking we were helping him, but now I feel kind of bad he’s at a 3rd grade level with his writing because of all the errors he has, and spending a lot of time typing whereas a lot of the other kids can do it without looking as much. 

So I was thinking of getting him an iPad for Christmas so he can get the hang of it better, but it feels too… soon? I don’t want him stuck on an iPad everywhere we go, so should I only let him use it at home? Am I just being weird, and should just suck it up and let him take it with him places? He has 20/20 eyesight too (dad and I wear glasses/contacts) so I don’t want him to ruin his eyes either with all the over exposure to blue light

I’m so sorry, I just feel so lost. He has video games + knows how to work YouTube at home where he can take as long as he needs to type stuff, and he has a lot of play dates and sleepovers with his friends, so he isn’t like in total isolation + knows about the dangers of the internet and stuff lol

754,She finally got rid of him - update,"Here is my post from a couple of weeks ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yo59k6/she_finally_got_rid_of_him/

I'm a loss of what to do. She ended up back with him. We were prepared for that, but it has spiraled massively since then. She came home on Sunday with roses and a ton of things he bought her. Then went to her room for the night. After that point, every single bit of communication with us was just angry. My husband went to talk to her in person, and she pushed him away hard. He just asked how she is feeling, because she is acting completely different. She refused to acknowledge it.

By 11am Tuesday, she decided she didn't want to live with us anymore, since, in her words, we don't love and care for her at all. We aren't taking care of her feelings. She packed her bags and went to another family. That family says they are in her corner and there to support her, but we have always had issues with them trying to get her back and subtly implying that we are bad parents. She lived with them for nine months before coming to me, and the reason she left was that they expressed they were not willing to adopt her and commit to 5 years. 

It is a whole mess of a situation and my husband and I are powerless. Today, the therapist office moved her therapy appointment time back an hour, and now she is refusing to go. It's another 3 weeks until I can get her in again. The other family isn't trying to talk her into going, because they say she is doing just fine with them. I just want to scream into the void. I feel like they're stealing my daughter.

In her mind, I think, they would have kept her from getting into an abusive relationship. They have more rules and are more controlling. But they also basically buy her everything she wants. They keep saying they're just her support while we work through things, but they aren't working with us to make sure she's facing and addressing this. I'm afraid if she still refuses, they're not going to push her to try and reconcile. 

Should I have taken her phone and forced no contact with her boyfriend? Definitely, at this point. But I had done that exact same thing with a different emotionally abusive relationship before, and it took us a full year to recover, and it still never returned to the way it was. It was a year of ER trips, anger, screaming, school refusal, doctors, therapists, psychiatrists, just everything. I was hesitant to go through it all again. 

At least I'm getting a mental health break too. I meet with my therapist tomorrow. This would be a lot easier if she was an adult, not 16.

755,11 yo Phone Privacy,"We got our son got a phone this year because he walks alone, along very busy streets, for a bit after school. I was really apprehensive about getting him a phone bc he's a freshman in a JHS that also has a HS in it, and I'm worried that he'd get exposed to stuff he shouldn't be if he made friends older than him. 

He's been talking to a girl that's in his grade and I've heard him loudly say ""I'm not ready for a gf or bf! Can I just wait until I'm a teenager??"" That made me giggle. and I was proud of him for being so confident in himself and creating his own boundaries. I also heard him talking to her about people in his grade that have crushes on him. Trust me, I'm not eavesdropping. He talks VERY LOUDLY. 

When I was a kid (I'm 40f) we weren't able to text and send pics and stuff. We had to sneak out and see each other in person, or write notes back and forth. Also the phone came with a long curly cord and there was NO privacy there lol. I guess I'm a little out of touch. I haven't looked through his phone but I was wondering what you all think about it?

**Setting a Healthy Balance around Tech**

Tech is a part of our lives and we cannot and do not want to remove it entirely, however, we do want to set healthy boundaries around the use of tech.

Research says that if you are engaging in screen time with your child and sharing that experience with them, it could minimize the detrimental effects of screen time.

Our kids need space to switch off, allowing time for children to develop their imagination.

It’s great to involve children in trying different things and finding flexibility in what works for you and your family.

Abby Lynch explains: Her kid wanted to watch her favorite show after school, but Abby didn’t want to make it a routine. She agreed but asked her kid to try something else the following day.

**The goal is to achieve that balance** and find a variety of non-screen activities that you and your child enjoy doing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Tech and Developing a Child’s Imagination**

Imagination can’t be taught, and children need opportunities to practice creating images in their minds, consider possibilities, and try out different roles while practicing language through self-talk.

Ways to foster your child’s imagination:

\- **Read books to your child**. It promotes brain development and imagination.

\- **Give your child ideas** on what to do. You may suggest a role-play.

\- **Find and create things** in nature together.

\- **Put out some materials for children to play with** that would spark an idea of their own.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Taking Control of Screen Time**

\- Parents might feel stuck using screens and feel like they can't shift how they've been parenting in this area.

\- Take having a screen in your car as an example. You introduce it on a long journey to pass the time, and the next thing you know, they can’t ride in a car without turning it on anymore.

\- It is important to remember that you have the **ability to take control** because you are the adult. Reset those boundaries and communicate this in an age-appropriate manner.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Parenting Advice To Go**

1. Remind yourself that you're the parent, and you're allowed to say no to using the screen.
2. Talk to your kids about it. No matter how young they are, set boundaries. You may come up with a question such as ‘’I wonder what we could do instead this time?’’.

768,3 year old loves naps. Hates bedtime,"I’m home with our youngest during the day. He goes to pre school from 8:30 - 11. We usually play at the park with his friends for a bit and then head home. He often falls asleep on the way home, and I’m biking him home, so not even a comfy car seat. Passed out in the seat. Or if he does make it home awake it’s super easy to put him down for a nap. Hasn’t alway been this way, but from about 18mo on, it was a couple books, pat pat, love you, good night. And that was that. Bed time is another story. I’ve probably successfully but him down a dozen times. Early on we were alternating and he would scream and yell and ask for momma. I was not help if he woke up in the middle of the night. Eventually we just gave up and I do naps and momma does bedtime. I put our oldest down. The thing is he doesn’t go to sleep for her either. He’s not crying, but he’s crazy. He can’t settle. If I come in he cries. If momma is there he goes crazy. And if she tries to leave he won’t have it. He’s in his own bed so he just gets up and comes out to get her. No amount of mind games work. On top of that this kid has long naps. I know the long naps are part of the problem but he won’t wake up because he’s not getting enough sleep at night because he won’t fall asleep until 10pm and then he wakes up 6-7am and then he has the 3 hour long naps. He’s sleep longer but I have to pick his brother up from school so then he’s mad at me when he wakes up. It’s a vicious cycle.

769,"please help, complex situation","Background: we are in the UK. My partner's ex has a mental illness. We are married happily.
They have a child together. Lately the ex has been poisoning the relationship between them. It's really bad and we are now in a stage of parental alienation from their side 😣

They currently have no court binding agreement and never been through one.

I don't want to share too many details, so here is my question:

What kind of support can we get? We are about to start a process of mediation but it doesn't seem hopeful. (The ex is non communicative)

If the ex is registered with mental illness (and medicated as far as I'm aware) does it mean they must have a case worker? How do we find out this information without asking the ex? (The ex will never give us this information)

What other resources can help us making sure the child is getting the best they can in their life, in terms of support and a healthy supportive environment?


Our main concern is the child's wellbeing. The fact that for weeks now we don't know what's going on with them is unbearable 🙁

770,SAHM struggling with transition to working again,"I've been a sahm for five years. Two kids. It's really pained me to admit to myself that I miss working and that our financial situation would be much easier if I brought in an income. My husband encouraged me to stay at home after our first when I was planning to return PT, because we would only break even on childcare. I sometimes resent him for that because I think it would have been worth it, psychologically, to stay in the workforce. Anyway, mostly it's been hard to admit that I really really miss work and feel like I haven't lived up to my potential by skipping out on grad school. I was doing OK with just one kid at home, but when we added the second, I started to burn out. I put a lot of pressure on myself to never use the tv, to be very ""conscious"" as a parent, read books and articles about parenting methods, go to all the library groups and playdates with moms I couldn't fit in with... I never wanted my kids in daycare like I was. I realize now that a lot of this was a reaction and overcompensation for my own childhood trauma, and my anxious hovering has likely impacted my oldest, making her a bit anxious (or perhaps it's inherited temperament?). So I've been doing some introspecting and trying to make a plan..  


We have zero childcare at the moment and I'm taking a certificate class and volunteering. My family of origin is a mess, and I've had to stop my mother from watching my kids, which has meant we are doing this on our own. Right now the TV is my babysitter which makes me feel guilty but I have no clue how else I'm supposed to write my essay for grad school applications with only an hour or two in the evenings (I pass out when the kids are finally asleep. My youngest will not fall asleep without me, so if I'm downstairs working late, he's still up at 9pm screaming for me...he's 2 and nurses to sleep). I can tell my husband isn't always happy with the TV thing--neither am I--but I just don't know what else to do. We can't afford a part time nanny and I'm just beginning to look at daycares we can afford for my youngest, part time.   


I love my children. I am having a hard time making the mental change from sahm parent, potentially homeschooling, to putting my kids in school and working on establishing a career at near midlife. I know if I don't try to do this, I will face a lot of disappointment with myself, though. I'm already stressed and feel like I am short with my kids and not really present with them in the ways they deserve because I don't have enough time to do anything for myself, and honestly, the daily 8+ hours of relentless caregiving for 5 years has just worn me down. I want to be in the adult world. Ideally, I would just work part time and be with my kids, but I have a goal of a certain career which will require some more full time work to establish at first. Ideally, I would have a bunch of supportive and healthy family and friends but here we are, just my husband and I, and it feels like we are drowning.  


Just wondering if any other sahp's have transitioned out of their role... how did you deal with the feelings of missing something you realize isn't really working for you? How did you handle a transition to daycare etc for a younger child? It's so hard struggling toward something unknown and feeling like if you could just be content in the life you have now, things would be easier...",yxr9zv,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yxr9zv/sahm_struggling_with_transition_to_working_again/,parenting
771,4 year old is afraid of everything.,"My oldest daughter turned 4 in the summer and started school in September (UK). We also have a 20 month old.

She's always been quite outgoing, funny, not afraid to go and do what she wants. Over the past 6 months or so she's become increasingly 'fearful' and nothing we do seems to help.

 It began with a general fear of 'monsters', she was talking about them a lot but it didn't seem to affect her in other ways. She used to leave her room in the morning and come into our bedroom but now she just stays in bed and either shouts for us or 'pretend cries' which usually wakes the toddler too... Last night she was up for 2 hours and kept 'crying' because she either heard a noise or was 'just sad', I try to be as reassuring as possible at 2AM. She now won't get out of the car and walk to the house or walk up the stairs on her own, mostly insisting to be carried. Last night we read 'We're going on a bear hunt' which used to be one of her favourites but she spent the last half hiding from the bear.

I was hoping that once halloween was over she might calm down a bit, my thoughts were that it might be playing on her mind. We didn't go trick or treating because our neighbour had some minion decorations that spooked her so we went straight home. Since Halloween there has been no improvement, maybe slightly worse. 

We've tried giving her a better night light, torch, give her reassuring talks. I'm running out of ideas! There's been no big upheavals in our lives to trigger this (Other than starting school) and everything at home is fine so I'm not sure what more we can do.

772,I need some feedback on my expectations of daycare,"The main issue 

My 14 month old has been in daycare for about 4 months now for 2 days a week. 
So on tuesday I log in to the camera to see how he's doing. His room is empty. I use the chat function of the daycare's app to ask what's going on and they say they combined his room with the next age group up and give me camera access to that room. There are 13 kids and 2 teachers. In my state for his age it's 5:1. I call up there several times over the course of a few hours and no one is answering. I ask them to call me in the chat. A few hours later I get a call from the director and they said they had a teacher out and their phones have been down and tell me this is the appropriate student teacher ratio. I politely point out it is not for his age group and tell them I'm well aware there is a staffing shortage in just about every industry and if they can't maintain the proper ration in his age appropriate room to please let me know and I'll just pick him up. I'd feel better and it would relieve their burden. I also suggest letting parents know via the app if the phones are down so it doesn't cause parents to worry if they can't get a hold of their childcare provider. She agrees. 

Today, same thing happened but it's 9 kids to 1 teacher. I call and ask what's the deal and they said they would move him. So they move him and 2 other kids into his normal room then strap him into a bouncer.... He's 25 pounds and walks like a champ. Way to big and old for a bouncer. 
He is average size/age for his room so not like he's the biggest one and shoving other kids over or something. 
My suspicion is there's some outbreak of an illness going around that has teachers and students out sick but they are choosing to not inform parents. 

Am I expecting too much? Is this just how daycares are? 



 More background if it's relevant. 

 I've been disappointed with their lack of communication and inconsistencies. There is an app for them to log food, diapers, naps, etc. This gets logged maybe half the time. I think okay, annoying but not a big deal. I'm not sure what he's eating at daycare and it seems like they throw his food away that I send from home that he doesn't eat. I ask for them to just send it back so I know how much he's eating and what I should or should not be sending. They rarely do this. Again, irritating but nothing that warrants a call I think. And in general they just don't communicate. He'll come home in different clothes and his old clothes in a bag covered in vomit. And not just spit up. Like he is sick and vomiting. I told them if he's not feeling well to please just let me know and I'll come get him. (I wfh so would rather him be home with me if he's sick). But they still don't tell me. This has happened several times. 
His first day there I saw his teacher picking up him and the other kids by their arms. Like from the ground to the highchair. I called and was told the teacher is good and has so many years experience. I said I don't care, just don't pick up my kid by his arms. And to be fair I haven't seen that since.

774,What was your baby like during after illness,"My baby (almost 8 months) was throwing up on saturday late evening, we called the pediatrician and they said no need for ER just give Tylenol for fever, pedialyte for loss of fluids. 

The last time he threw up was Sunday morning, and his fever was completely gone by Monday.

He has little cranky moments here and there now but is smiling like normal eating his normal purées and oatmeal, and almost as much formula as normal. 

I called his pediatrician again yesterday and described his symptoms and they said the same, as long as he’s not having trouble breathing and is not dehydrated we just treat the symptoms until it passes.

My question is about energy level. He’s just a little more tired than his normal self. I wouldn’t describe him as lethargic but needing more naps and just not 100%. His lips are normal coloring and he’s having no issues breathing, just coughing sometimes through the day (which I see as a good sign that mucus is breaking up and coming out-lmk if I’m wrong).

775,How To Get 2.5 Year Old to Play Independently,"My daughter is two and a half, born during the start of the pandemic. She was an only child until 5 months ago when her little sister was born. I always kinda figured that eventually she would get to a point where she would just play by herself, but it still hadn't happened by the time her sister was born. 
Now it's becoming a bit of a problem because my wife is trying to put the baby down for a nap while I'm at work, and the toddler is just sitting around in our room, waiting for my wife to be finished. She could be expending energy playing by herself, but she isn't. And sometimes the baby wakes up once or twice during her nap and has to be put back to sleep while the toddler is just messing around in the bedroom. By the time it's time for the toddler's nap she hasn't used enough energy to go to sleep. This affects her evening mood and the whole dynamic of the household. 

She won't play by herself. She wants momma or daddy to be playing with her.

780,Teenage son confided in me that he has confidence issues. How do I best support him?,"Throwaway because he knows my username. 

I would love some advice from parents who may have gone through something similar. My son is 15 and an only child, so I don’t have the experience to draw wisdom from. It’s particularly challenging for me because this kid seemingly “has everything”: he’s incredibly smart (straight A’s his whole life), is athletic, tall and handsome - such a weird thing to include but he gets compliments often on his looks, so he doesn’t just hear it from me and his dad though we try not to focus on those and more on being compassionate, curious, etc. - kind, warm, hilarious, has interesting hobbies, even has a lovely gf, and from what I hear from his friends he’s pretty well-liked in school, too. I made the mistake of pointing out his strengths to try to shift his focus on things to be grateful for but in retrospect I realized that it was extremely dismissive of his emotions, so I apologized and tried to reassure him that I’ll try my best to be supportive and make him feel seen and heard when he expresses his doubts. 

On the surface you wouldn’t guess that he has confidence issues at all. He’s pretty assertive in public, has no trouble speaking to strangers if needed, voices his opinions, preferences, and needs when warranted and politely at that, and at school we always get feedback and notes from his teachers about his participation and leadership, etc. so I’m a bit lost. 

Is this natural for his age and is this something he should grow out of? What should I do so that he feels supported as he navigates this tricky phase?  If it’s out of my hands to help him see all that he is, how do I at least ensure that he doesn’t convince himself that he is what he isn’t? I admit that I have difficulty communicating with him sometimes though we get along really well, which probably adds to his concerns. I am a Feeler type mom who thinks it’s important to discuss and celebration emotions and can express how I feel easily so I am big on being emotionally available, whereas he hesitates and struggles a bit with expressing himself or at least his emotions on a deeper level. I don’t force this but I do encourage it. I wonder if it can feel suffocating for him for me to check on his emotional state while he’s trying to sort who he is and his place in this world… If so, how do make sure he knows I am there for such needs without being overbearing? 

If it means anything, dad is present and they both adore each other. They have similar dispositions and dad isn’t the type to initiate heartfelt deep conversations, so that’s where I step in but our home is typically full of affection - hugs, verbal I love yous, and laughter between the three of us. We enjoy each other’s company but are also big on giving each other space. It’s not always perfect but is full of love, I think. Just wanted to paint what it’s like at home if it means anything. 

Thank you so much for your time and help. I am raising a particularly wonderful kid and it hurt me to hear that he’s suffering from low self-esteem. I hate the idea that he doesn’t see himself the way we and the rest of the world sees him, and that it’s causing him pain. I can only imagine how confusing it must be for him too, to feel that way when you aren’t lacking in “proof” that says otherwise. 

Yesterday I told him while driving that I’m sorry for overlooking how much it must take for him to be such a great kid. I know it’s innate and naturally who he is as well, but it’s so easy to forget that it’s still a choice for him and many other good kids to maintain and balance a lot of things - being a good child, a good friend, a good student, etc. He said it meant a lot to hear me say that, and I feel ashamed that it took me a while to realize that. 

I just want to be the parent he needs and deserves. 

Thanks again for everything.",yxw1yp,1,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yxw1yp/teenage_son_confided_in_me_that_he_has_confidence/,parenting
781,i want to help my son stop stealing,"It started last year with my oldest stealing little things and once i noticed i started explaining to him that that wasn't correct and that i was not going to support that. He cried and said he wasn't going to do it anymore. I took the items back and really I thought he stopped, untill my mom called me and told me not to punish him but that she caught him stealing from her. I talked to him about it and all he could say was that he didn't know why he did it. I thought i appropriately punished him by taking away all the things he liked. I even asked a few police officers to speak to him about the consequences of stealing (not to scare him but because he wants to be a police officer when he grows up). In the following months I've caught him stealing from my mom again, from kids at school, from the store and most recently from me. When i caught him stealing from the store i started making him take everything back every time. I've taken away his games toys tv outings everything at this point and I'm lost. I sit down and talk to him and it's always ""i don't know"" but this last time he stole from me he told me that it's because he misses his dad. I feel like I'm a sh!tty parent and honestly maybe I'm doing something wrong that i can't see so maybe someone can give me an objective opinion an advice idk but i don't want son to keep stealing. He's only 8 and i can't sit here and tell him adult business. His dad isn't involved by his own choice. Talking to his dad is out of the question i don't even have his number or address nothing.

782,1 Year Old's Communication,"I'm trying to see if I should be concerned about my 16 month old's communication development. We started introducing some simple sign language around 8-9 months (""please"", ""thank you"", ""food"", etc.), and she learned most of them quite quickly. She actually seems fairly proficient at physical communication; she'll point to her feet and sign ""please"" if she wants to put her shoes on, for example. 

She also understands things we say to her; we can say ""Do you want to wash your hands in the bathroom?"" and she'll walk to the bathroom and point at the sink.

However, she seems to be a little behind with regards to her verbal communication skills. She can say ""Mom"" and ""Da,"" though she rarely does. I haven't heard her utter any other words. She'll babble constantly, but doesn't seem interested in trying to mimic my wife or I when we attempt to teach her new words.

Should we try a different approach, maybe slowly stop responding or reacting until she tries to say something? Or am I worrying for no reason and should just let her do things at her own pace?

I have a 19 month currently in daycare and will have a newborn at home in 3 weeks. I’d like to continue sending my toddler in to school, but when I asked out pediatrician his opinion he annoyingly kept it vague (“it’s a family decision”), but also said that my toddler will definitely bring something home with him this winter and that it’s vital my newborn doesn’t get a fever in the first 8 weeks.

We’re going to provide coffee/tea - self serve - with a basket of muffins/croissants etc for the parents. I think having some Baileys to add to coffee on a Saturday morning while watching kids and chatting with fellow parents would be a nice touch, something to make it more extra for the parents. 

I don’t think it’s weird to have some Baileys in the morning on a special occasion. Maybe other parents would find this wired though. Especially if they are going grocery shopping afterwards or something, ha!

At other parties I’ve attended - in the afternoons - people have provided beer and cider for parents.

790,Asking for an advice: Being picked on school bus.,"First I would like to apologized for my grammar as its not my first language. Thank you.

My son is a 1st grader and rides the school bus. There has been several occasions that he was being picked on by a fellow kid on the bus. He is being called ""poopyhead"" and the kid sometimes like to go for a vote to ask fellow kids on the bus if my son is a poopyhead or whatever he wants to call him. That makes my son doesnt want to go to school.

Me and my wife told him to talk to the bus driver and tell him whats going on. We also told him to ignore them and dont believe them (*by doing that, we told him that they will stop bothering him since they cant get anything from him*). But knowing kids, they will still get affected by it.

 As a parent, I'm not sure when to act and escalate it. I know i cannot protect him all the time. Is this a chance for him to develop on how to handle this kind of situation?

 And if I escalate it, I'm afraid that he might get picked on more. And might not tell us what's happening to him at school/bus.

792,8yo Bus Stop Troubles,"Hi all,

My 8yo takes the bus to school. Just recently the bus schedule changed, and he now gets picked up 20 minutes later than usual (7:55 rather than 7:30). The bus stop is probably 50 feet from our house.


I work nights, so when I get home at 7 I go right to bed usually. My wife works, and has to get out of the house by as close to 7:30 as she can get. So typically in mornings my wife would get my 8yo to the bus stop, then drive my 6yo to school, then go to work.


Now that the route has changed, she's suddenly feeling comfortable leaving him to wait at the bus stop alone. We tried a trial run of it last week where I stayed up and made sure he got on the bus ok, and now this coming week she wants to do it for real. Here's my problem.


First, I'm not sure he is ready for that kind of responsibility. He's not allowed to have a phone at school, so I can't just give him a cheap cell, so if he has a problem he's expected to come back in and get me. 


Second, there's another parent of a similar aged kid at the bus stop. Our kid goes to hang out with theirs until the bus comes. I don't want to offload parenting duties onto her; my kid will do whatever is most convenient, he will absolutely ask her instead of coming all the way inside. I can have a talk with him about this but I'm not sure it will come to anything.


So there we have it. My wife is adamant that it's fine, he can be there by himself, he's old enough and we're close by, and other 8yos do it without issue. You've heard my side. What do you think? Terrible idea or am I being too controlling?",yxtzni,0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yxtzni/8yo_bus_stop_troubles/,parenting

Her ideal bedtime is 7:30-8 because we wake up by 6 to get ready in the mornings. Although, she could actually sleep later than that cause she doesn't leave for school till 8:30. But, she almost never actually makes it to that late in the evenings. By 6:30, she's either falling asleep in the living room or having massive meltdowns over everything because she's tired. But when she goes to bed that early, she inevitably wakes up really early too.

We have a bedtime routine that we do every night, though we adjust it a little if she's really tired.

On the mornings she wakes up really early, she tries to go back to sleep, but never seems to be able to. So she either wakes my husband or I up to ask something, or she's just up in her room until the rest of us get up. This wouldn't be an issue except for the resulting exhaustion at school and in the evenings causing major drama.

They literally have 3 practices left and the race. At this point, I feel like he should stick it out because he's so close to done and I think he'll be proud of himself for finishing the race. But I also told him I'd let him quit if he made it past October and still hated it. So I'm torn between keeping my word and encouraging him when he's made it this far.

797,Struggling with Mother in-law who has 0 respect and 0 boundaries,"TLDR; my mother in law told my fiancee to buy my 5 and 10 year old boys mini fridges for christmas, i explained i was against it because they are not allowed to eat or drink in their rooms because they make huge messes and spill all over the place but she bought them for her anyways and made me feel like an a-hole for saying no.

&#x200B;

Im feeling very overwhelmed today, my fiancée was out christmas shopping today and her mother asked her to pick up 2 mini fridges for our 5 year old and 10 year old boys... i had already advised my fiancee that it was a terrible idea when she had brought it up last week when her mother said she wanted to buy our YOUNGEST son a mini fridge... i started to get very upset when she said she was buying them explaining that the boys do not need mini fridges, they are children who can hardly clean up after themselves, having a mini fridge with food and drinks in their room would be a litteral mess of crumbs and garbage, on top of that, the boys would devour its full contents in one sitting then throw a fit if we dont refill it. we struggle with our oldest sons autism and adhd, we struggle with our youngest sons behavioral issues copying the oldests tantrums when they dont get their way. we struggle with structure more with the oldest one because he is bounced around constantly and we are the only place that he has some sort of stucture, his biological father gets him every second weekend where he watches tv the whole time, his grandparents get him nearly every other weekend and he locks himself in their rooms and watches TV and youtube which we do not allow and again they do not respect. at school he has already been labelled as troublesome so he is allowed to do and go wherever he wants, never given any repurcussions for his actions, only praised on good. 

&#x200B;

Last christmas my fiancees mother gave the oldest an iphone for christmas when he was 9... which again we where expected to front the phone bill every month. She heavily favours the oldest leaving the youngest feeling left out, she will tell both boys they will take both of them up for the weekend then turn around and only take the oldest, which my fiancee finally stood up to her mother and told her that it was wrong. before the mini fridges she planned on buying the oldest a laptop which i made sure didnt happen because we already struggle with his addiction to screens. i have no idea why she would buy young children mini fridges now, im baffled and im beyond irritated that my fiancee actually just bought them and made me feel like an a-hole... i have no idea what do anymore, im so frustrated that i cant even focus on my work, i will probably end up having to pack up and go home, im at my wits end with her mother. theres much more that i need to vent about but i am mentlly and physically drained.",yxswyw,0,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yxswyw/struggling_with_mother_inlaw_who_has_0_respect/,parenting

802,Six Year Old Obsessive about Ponytail,"Hi!

Our six year old daughter is quite obsessive about always having a ponytail. The first thing she does when waking up is running to us to make sure we tie a ponytail (she isn't yet capable of doing it on her own), and she will wear it until she goes to bed at night.

During the day, 2 or 3 times she would panic that her ponytail isn't tight enough, and she would ask us to re-do it.

If, for some reason, the ponytail breaks, she would cry and stress about it.

She is kind of a tom boy (likes wearing ""boy"" clothes, will not come near a dress), and we think that's related somehow (walking around with long hair not tied up is more ""girly-looking"" in her opinion).

The problem we have with this is that it's causing her a lot of misery (if the ponytail breaks or isn't tight enough, she would cry and stress out until it's sorted). We are wondering how we might help her be more chill about it.

Would love to hear your thoughts (especially if you experienced something similar).

803,Losing My Mind a Bit,"I (28F) nanny during the work week for two little kids, Rachel (2F) and Jordan (6monthsM). Rachel is related to me and a typical toddler, we have problems sometimes but overall I can manage her just fine. Jordan, less so.

He's the youngest of a very big family, with nine older siblings (the youngest of whom is 7), and a ton of cousins etc. He is held almost 24/7 at home. He is not used to being alone or not held, and he screams almost incessantly whenever I try to put him on the floor/tummy time/in the playpen/excersaucer/literally anything but physically holding or touching him.

To get him to nap (excluding the times he falls asleep on me when drinking his bottle), I usually lay him in the playpen and just have to listen to him scream for an hour or more. It's completely impractical for me to hold him all the time, being that I am one person, and also have to look after Rachel and household chores etc. He has tons of toys in the playpen and I do give him cuddles and attention multiple times a day even aside from feeding/changing. I always make sure he's dry and fed before putting him down, and the playpen is in the same room where Rachel and I are during the day. If I pick him up he always immediately stops crying.

At one point I thought he would eventually get used to having less direct attention while here, but it's been a couple of months now and he's still the exact same. I feel horrible admitting this even though I know it's relatively normal for parents and caregivers.... but sometimes I get so mad that I just don't care anymore???? I would never do anything rash but sometimes I just want to yell at him or I just kinda say ""screw it"" to myself and put headphones on or play with Rachel on the other side of the room. I don't like feeling this way, and a lot of the time I feel like... I should just pick him up?? Because it's not his fault he's like this but then I'm also like... idk because it's not my fault either and I was hoping to break him out of this a bit because it's miserable for both of us (not to mention not healthy for him) but idk if that's even going to be possible when he's still coddled non-stop at home no matter what I do here during the week???

So here I am, struggling to find the balance between keeping my own sanity, and just sucking it up and comforting him. Right now I'm just kinda going day by day but sometimes I feel too overwhelmed and just want to tell his mom I won't sit him anymore... I am tight on money though and she doesn't have anyone else to ask so that really isn't the best option for anyone 😭 I do love Jordan, my family and his are close but doing this every single day is grating and it also doesn't feel fair to little Rachel that this kid either screams all day while she's trying to play, or has to have all my attention so I can barely do stuff with her. 

This got wordy, and I'm not really sure what I'm even looking for as an answer.... I'm just getting desperate at this point I guess.

This caused the test to be delayed and they only had 17 minutes to finish...which he then complained about not having enough time. 

Now his humanities teachers have said he's using his cell phone when he shouldnt be, talking to his friends, not following directions. He got sent to the ""planning room"" and lied to the teacher about why he was there. He said he was ""taking a break"" when he had been sent there because of his behavior. His teacher came and got him after a bit and he went back to class.

My son is smart and that might be part of the problem. He finds alot of classes boring and not important or ""worth it"". He really likes math. His grades are good, mostly As and 2 Bs because he was a slacker. He just doesnt value school and thinks its a waste of his time and he'd rather be socializing. My 17 year daughter is just the opposite of him - quiet in class, strives for all A+s (shes in National Honor Society and has a 4.33 GPA).

We should clean the tooth before it goes under the pillow right?

How does the tooth stay in place till the tooth fairy comes and how does the money stay in place all night? My kid more or less break dances in their sleep and the pillow is frequently on the other side of their room by morning.

If by some miracle their pillow stays under their head and the tooth stays under their pillow till the kid falls asleep how do I get the tooth out without waking them up and blowing the tooth fairy’s cover?

What’s the current tooth to cash exchange rate? I assume it’s not a quarter anymore?

What happens to the teeth after the tooth fairy takes them? I assume everybody keeps the first tooth their kid loses but are people keeping an entire mouth’s worth of baby teeth for each kid?

809,Two year old + pregnant. Losing my mind. Please help,"I grew up in a strict, corporal-punishing household. From belts to hands to isolation to yelling and everything in between. I didn’t want that for my kids, so went with the gentle-parenting approach.

My daughter is recently two. EVERYTHING causes a meltdown (No, she is not on the spectrum. Yes, I’m sure.) 

Being told no. Being told yes. Being given something. Having something taken away. Doing something she didn’t ask you to do. Doing something she asked you to do. The list goes on and on.

I’m at my wits end. I cannot take anymore “explaining” to a screaming child.

When she melts down, she hits me, herself, or objects/walls/floors. She screams. She throws things. She’s inconsolable and won’t listen.

Sometimes, she’ll say things like “don’t touch it” “give it to me” etc etc, and I’ll try to explain that there’s a better way to get your message across, just to be blatantly ignored, OR she’ll tell me no or to go away or not talk to her.

No, I don’t just let these things happen. I try to correct them. I’m not okay with them. I’m not a “pushover”, as some have come to call ‘gentle parenters’, which is a weird term in itself but that’s a discussion for another time.

I feel awful as, this morning, she woke up and automatically flew into a fit because she wanted an orange but not THAT orange. She threw it at my face, and I instinctively popped her mouth. I immediately felt terrible, and it obviously just made things worse. 

I don’t want to use physical punishment- I don’t support it. I don’t know what to do.

We’ve tried talking. Comforting/consoling. Explaining. Time outs. Removing her from the situation. Removing objects related to the situation. Ignoring. 

I don’t know what else to do.

When she loses it, she screams, cries, and will thrash and get worse if you try to touch her.

She’s with me half the day, then with her grandparents/dad the other half (we all live together). I will say that my parents let her get away with too much (she’s the first grandchild), but I can often hear and get there to interject and try to correct it.

I just don’t know what to do.

I’m due in less than a month. I’m so tired, and I don’t want these issues migrating to the next kid. I don’t want them getting worse, or becoming permanent. 

My aunts/uncles have well behaved kids, but they’re afraid of their parents- like I was. I don’t want that. 

And I don’t know how much my toddler actually understands of what I’m saying- her speech is still forming.

Please help me. I don’t want to keep longing for the times she sleeps, and fretting the moment she wakes up. 

Please no “wait it out” comments.

I do understand that toddlers have tantrums and such. They are still learning to regulate their emotions- as am I. I’m not looking to get rid of them completely, just lessen them and find better coping strategies for her AND me. I just need less freak outs than multiple an hour, and to be better at handling them. I have SPD (a sensory processing disorder), so my main method so far has been to just dissociate so I don’t freak out myself. And the hitting/throwing triggers my PTSD & flight or fight, which I’m working on in therapy

(I fcked up by losing my temper and getting physical, like I’ve said. I want to figure out ways to do and be better. Hateful comments will not help. I feel awful for what I did, and don’t want to ever, ever again- which is why I’m seeking HELP)",yy07zh,0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yy07zh/two_year_old_pregnant_losing_my_mind_please_help/,parenting

811,I loaned my son a book that is very special to me and he ruined it.," I have been a bookworm basically my whole life, so I’ve been very pleased that my kids are all fairly avid readers as well. 

One book in particular has held a special place in my heart for a long time. It’s the first one for a series that I read over and over when I was about 11 - 16 or so. This series was my happy place and I have such fond memories of falling in love with it for the first time.

I still have the book, and decided randomly to offer it to my son (12). He seemed enthusiastic and I wasn’t worried.

Well…3 weeks later, I just found it in his room almost destroyed. It was literally jammed up under his bed with a bunch of junk. Like it had been kicked under there like nothing. The cover is torn. Pages are falling out. The back looks like it’s been wet.

I am just gutted. I didn’t even think twice about loaning it to him, never imagined this would happen. He’s a fairly responsible kid, not the type to destroy things. I simply said “that book is important to me so take good care of it, alright?” And he said he would.

My husband says I am “making something out of nothing” but he is 12, almost 13. In my opinion that is more than old enough to know better. I read it repeatedly at the same age and managed to take care of it. He’s never damaged a book from school or the library like this. There’s no excuse, frankly.

I really don’t know what to do about this or what to make of it. I normally am a pretty firm parent who believes in reasonable consequences, and if it was anything else, I would’ve told him he needs to pay to replace it. But this isn’t just any book. I don’t care about the damn $10 or whatever a new copy would cost. The sentimental value, which I can’t get back, is priceless and irreplaceable. 

I’m just extremely disappointed and I don’t even know what to do. I know I should say something, but what? Is this even a punishable offense? I’m so upset I have just tabled the issue right now, he has no idea I’ve taken the book back and now I’m just trying to figure out how to handle it.",yxi3x0,3,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yxi3x0/i_loaned_my_son_a_book_that_is_very_special_to_me/,parenting
812,Fair share of parenting? All I do is sit home with a baby…,"Ok so I am trying to wrap my head around a thing, how are your duties split?

I maintain all the house hold chores, cook about 50% of the time, go to school full time and am working 2-3 nights a week serving. When I’m not working I’m on baby duty from wake up to bed time. Partner wakes up between 8am and 10am, cooks the other 50%, takes dog 2x a day and does trash 1x a week. He works self employed, it’s definitely a lot of heavy lifting, but it’s flexible and he’s usually able to get an afternoon nap in. Our finances are completely separate.

813,Why do I bother taking my kids to restaurants?,"My kids are relatively well-behaved in restaurants, but the whole experience is an exercise in frustration, and I just need to type it up to get it out of my system.

The oldest knows exactly what he wants to order. The second needs help reading the menu, but she makes a choice. The youngest can't decide between the corn dog or the chicken strips, but it doesn't matter, because whichever one he picks will the the ""wrong"" one when it arrives at the table. Now the second kid needs help reconsidering her side dish, but the server is here, and I haven't even had a chance to look at my menu yet, so I try to scan for the first thing that looks good while listening to the kids order to make sure they're polite and that they ask for what they actually want.

The oldest scarfs down his burger and fries in less than a minute. The second takes three bites of her mac-and-cheese, complains that it's not the same as the mac-and-cheese at home, then sucks on her chocolate milk sullenly. The youngest hates everything I put in front of him and insists that his apple juice is ""spicy"" (it wasn't; I checked).

I take one bite.

Now the oldest is done and is trying to tell me about his day at school, which somehow requires bouncing on the bench. The second is picking her fries apart and eating them in lentil-sized nibbles, but at least she's eating. The youngest has consented to eat his chicken strips, but he needs me to cut them for him, which I do while watching for the server to come by so I can request the side of ranch the younger two kids can't live without.

I take another bite.

The oldest and the second are tickling each other, which I think I should interrupt, but they're not being loud or disruptive, and none of the other guests around us seem to mind. The youngest needs to go to the bathroom. When I get back, someone has fished some ice out of my drink (to eat it, thankfully) with the mac-and-cheese spoon, so now I have cheese sauce in my root beer.

I take a third bite.

Everyone else is done and ready to go home. The older two understand that they need to wait for me to eat, but they keep asking me questions every ten seconds, and I'm trying to avoid being a hypocrite by talking with my mouth full after I've told them to not do that. One minute the youngest is whining that he hates this place and wants to go home, the next he's asking for more apple juice.

The table is, remarkably, not a mess other than the empty plates, two straw wrappers, and the crayons that have rolled away during the meal.

We finally pay the check (with a big tip because the server has been fantastic), pack up our leftovers and walk out the door. The second we get home and into the house: ""Dad, can I have a snack?""

Also I regret not being able to afford going to things like concerts or trampoline parks, not being able to take vacations very much and having never flown them anywhere.

I don’t like the idea of gift-giving. I don’t find pleasure in material things and my husband agrees with me. I don’t want to make Christmas about gifts and prefer to make it about family and helping those in need. Our families on both sides (large families) want to give our daughter gifts even though I asked them not to. Should I let it be? Will our views/beliefs take away from my child’s childhood/Christmas enjoyment? If we ever spend Christmas with family, she’d probably feel bad that she doesn’t get gifts?

826,I need serious help.,"Hello, this is very long and complicated, but i am very young and lost, and would be so so grateful for some advice.

Iam a 19 year old girl and I recently under complicated conditions got guardianship over my 12 year old sister. I wanted this, I have wanted her to come live with me for a long time. I love and am so blessed that she is.

 I was not prepared yet, I was working on my house and self to become prepared to take full care of my sister but in a rushed set of circumstances I a couple weeks ago got her early.

I have family that supports me, but its up completely to me to take care of her.

But I'm failing.

She fed, schooled, help with homework, get 8 hours of sleep, her own bed/room, has family and friend to play with. Physical all her needs are met.

The problem is me and her. We came from a unstable and very verbally/emiontional(rarely physically) abusive home. However we have reacted differently. A little tmi but when I was in the house I was in the responsible role, cook, clean, take care of my mom, grandmother, step-dad, and sister. I was a failed homeschooling since 14, so I had no contact with anyone other than my family. I've always been a people pleaser(not a good thing) which led to me trying to keep the peace whatever nessary.

Coming from that home has slightly screwed us up. I have of anxiety and self doubt, but the most important thing to my problem is it has made me VERY VERY scared of conflict. To the point conflict makes me have panic attacks and I will most definitely cry after every conflict(not exactly ideal when raising a child).

Now my sister is exactly the opposite of me, always has been she's very loud and extroverted which I love about her. 

Before I left I would try to protect her all I could from everything, however after I left she became the absolute main target. While I'm a ""take it so you don't make it worst."", she does not take no shit from no one. Which did not go well with our abuser. After I left they would constantly get into screaming fights. She also dealt with a lot of physical abuse after I left. 

She is very conflict driven and has bad anger issues from the situation.

Now that backstorys over, the point is I'm having a lot of trouble. First off my house is not done, I have a lot left to renovate(its livable tho), and since my sister is going to school and has problems sometimes I wanted to work somewhere nearby so I've quit my job that was an hour away to find work where we live(don't worry I saved up for this and am financially stable enough to stay afloat while I look for new work). So my house is not done and I'm unemployed. 

Me and my sister, my approach to parenting her is the gentle parenting. Don't get me wrong I absolutely do not let her run without rules, but I'm just gentle with my approach. When she does something wrong I want to talk it out with her and then decide the consequences(which always depend on what's appropriate for the situation).

And I love her to death but she is so mean sometimes. Some of the things she says is ""at least I have friends, your stupid you know that, mom loved me best, at least im not ugly, etc"" all these she plays off as jokes so she doesn't get in trouble but there always passive aggressive. Then whats worse is when she gets in trouble then she starts to curse such as calling me a dickhead, a bitch(alot) and occasionally throwing things. She HATES being told no to which she will throw fit, first getting an addiute, then cursing and insulting, then mabye throwing a thing or two before I shut it down.

When she acts like this I stand my ground tell her that her behavior is unacceptable and set consequences appropriately.

I truly think I can handle her with time. Out of all the people to care for her I've been the only one to handle her. 

My mental health has went down the drain, I was working on it before so I didn't get like this but shes living with me early than expected so it has stop my progress on getting better. 

I am depressed, but what the worst is my anxiety. I get up get her ready for school then stay in bed all day, I clean the house but have to take breaks, I have panic attacks alot I haven't went a day without having one in about two weeks. I feel like I'm failing and am just lazy but I'm truly struggling so bad right now. The last two days have been the worst I can't leave the house, I just curl up and cry. 

Of course I don't do this around her, once she get home I welcome her, she does her homework, we watch TV, and I cook dinner most nights.

I just don't know what to do to fix this. I'm just new to being a guardian and I don't know how to do this completely. How do I handle her anger and attitude. How do I parent a child with my mental health in the drain. Most importantly how do I handle my mental health while all my focusing is on taking care of a child.

It's hard enough being a new mother, let alone trying to work and pump during the day. I looked into the regulations at my work place and found out that I am supposed to have a fridge allotted to just breastfeeding mothers.

830,Fiancé got mad at my parents over a diaper rash.,"Hi, I’m new to this Reddit community so I’m still getting the feels for how it goes around here. But I’m in need of some advice on how to approach an issue regarding my fiancé getting angry at my parents (who have 5 kids of their own) over our 1 year old getting a diaper rash on her bottom. For context, my parents both had careers in the medical field before retirement, and would never have let such a rash go untreated. They weren’t pediatricians, but my mom has the training and knowledge of a pediatric nurse as well as many other medical fields, along with my dad.

Back to the story, our daughter spent the weekend at my parents house as both my fiancé and I had to work all weekend and it was the best plan we could come up with as his parents had plans of their own. The rash was not noticed until Monday afternoon, when she returned home around 3:00. My fiancé was not home, he was at work until 10:00. However, it was immediately treated with the proper cleaning and diaper cream. I didn’t change her diapers on Monday when she returned home as I had to leave soon after with my mom to go for an MRI. By the time we got back it was already her bedtime and she was already in her pjs.

The next day is when I found out about it from my fiancé, who called me while I was on my break and ranted about how my parents were incompetent and how he would pursue legal action if it ever happened again. Needless to say, I hung up on him as I was at work and did not want him causing a scene. When I got home, he showed me the rash and began ranting about how my parents were trying to hurt our daughter and how they didn’t know how to take care of a baby and so on. 

I pointed out that her diet has changed and so has her waste, and I called my parents to get their side. They said the same things I did, which my fiancé only tuned out.

831,"Signed 3yo up for gymnastics, found out it’s a faith based program.. am I overreacting?","Prior to signing up and attending classes, I didn’t realize this was a Christian gymnastics group. It’s not noted on their website, so it was a surprise at our first class that they start the class with any prayer requests, and then a prayer before stretches. 

In the younger group she started in, they were too little to give a prayer request, so it was just a short prayer given by the teacher and we moved on. I was fine with this, but now that we’ve moved up to the 3/4 year group, the other children sing Sunday school songs as their prayer. So we sat through 3 renditions of God Our Father in a row, and then still followed by a prayer. 

My partner and I are not religious, and this isn’t something I am ready to expose my 3 year old to. 
Yet I feel incredibly guilty for removing her from the class, and like I may possibly be overreacting by doing so..

Is a prayer and a few songs really that big of a deal? Should I just get over it, seeing as it’s inevitable that she will be exposed to it eventually anyway? 
Living in a southern, conservative area.. I feel like I’m being silly and this was to be expected.",yw45vf,893,704,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yw45vf/signed_3yo_up_for_gymnastics_found_out_its_a/,parenting
832,Parental controls for teenagers? Especially for smartphones? Feels like all or nothing.,"I'm not trying to go completely psycho, but my kid has behavior issues. Most would refer to her as a ""troubled teen."" I just want to find a middle ground between, ""I have a phone for safety, to contact my friends, any hotlines or anything needed for resources, and to use the apps my parent chooses"" and ""I have free reign to anything."" At one point she had a flip phone which was the medium point, but she was made fun of at school because we are kinda poor compared to others in our area, and after better behavior over the summer I bought her a prepaid smartphone. She has backslid in behavior and it is apparent her relationship with the internet  The thing is, she is 13. I looked to see if I could add Google Family Link to her device which seemed like a great idea but it says after 13 they can opt out of any supervision. If this would just lock the device, that would be great! She can agree to be supervised, or only be able to access emergency numbers. This however does not seem to be the case.

What I am looking to do:

1. Block specific numbers. During my child's time with her father she began meeting strangers on Discord and her interactions with some of these people are... problematic at best. However, on the no contract phone plan I was on, I had no access to block specific numbers. I thought since the phone was under my name I could do that or view some kind of call log, but that was not the case.
2. Possibly view incoming text/phone call logs. This is not to be completely crazy, it is to see if there are recurring phone numbers that are not local that pop up.
3. Be able to turn off data usage period at will. (Smartphone) The reason I want this is because if school is not attended I want to be able to turn off data entirely for the day. On or off. And control the hours it may be used.

&#x200B;

What I have already done/have brainstormed:

1. Discord is blocked entirely on my router. You have to be on phone data, which she had a limited amount so she could not really use it excessively.
2. May possibly block Tiktok/Instagram and some other big social medias until trust can be rebuilt. (She has been sneaking, lying, etc. and it needs to stop. She can have a life, but lying and sneaking is something that has escalated and I want to put an end to it.)
3. Have learned how to use my IP address to view what is being accessed via wifi
4. Will be adding Firewalla most likely, which will show me spikes in bandwidth to know if a VPN is being used via large bandwidth usage alerts to bypass the controls in place.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any suggestions or advice for parental controls for kids who are 13+ but aren't making wise choices with technology other than turning everything off and only providing them with a ""dumb phone"" please let me know. I will do the dumb phone if I have to, but she does have a hard time making friends here and has a few she has made when she came with me to anime conventions and such, and she does like to play games with them and stream things and I don't want to take that from her unless I have to since she has a hard time fitting in with the kids around here.",yx83wh,5,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yx83wh/parental_controls_for_teenagers_especially_for/,parenting

834,I'm an overachiever concerned about my only child,"I'm new to this thread so my apologies if this has been discussed before.  

I grew up in poverty to immigrants that barely scraped by.  My formative experiences were those created by watching my parents struggle in poverty and a deep understanding of self-reliance.  I remember very clearly my father telling me that if I didn't get into university I wasn't welcome home.  Fast forward many years and I have a Ph.D. (chemistry) and am in a high income career.  I continue to struggle with feelings of inadequacy and work 12 hours/day.  I have never lived a day without feelings of insecurity and inadequacy.  

I have a son who has turned 13 (only child).  He has only known a very comfortable lifestyle and he has been spoiled since the day he was born.  His conception of poverty are abstract ideas of homeless people he sees on the streets but he's never missed a meal and he is surrounded by the comforts and distractions of a lifestyle I have worked hard to provide.  

My concern is that he minimally puts in the effort at school.  He gets mediocre grades and all he cares about are his baseball card collections and playing Xbox on the weekends.  I spend a lot of time helping him with his homework but he is unfocused and doesn't retain anything when we repeat the same exercises the next day.  I tell him how much harder things are today than when I was when I was a kid and how much harder things will be in the future when he has to provide for himself.  I am concerned that I have created feelings of entitlement and someone who will be ill prepared for the enormous difficulties that lie ahead.  I am deadly afraid of him being a 30+ year old with no career prospects living with my wife and me.  

How have you instilled into your children a sense of responsibility and seriousness?  I see everything from my own, limited and myopic perspective.  A greater external perspective is very much appreciated.",ywy96w,10,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ywy96w/im_an_overachiever_concerned_about_my_only_child/,parenting
835,1 year old fell down the wood stairs today,"She’s fine, so far. I took her to the doctor even though she cried for only about 30 seconds and didn’t have a scratch on her. 

I (mom) however am NOT fine. I was in the bathroom and she opened the bedroom door, and I think she slid halfway down the stairs first. I ran out and saw her sit up on the step about halfway down, maybe step 5, and then in horror I saw her tumble backwards as I screamed and ran after her. Of course I couldn’t make it fast enough. I thought about throwing my body down the stairs to beat her and break her fall, but the odds of that being successful were near 0. So I watched her little face roll and tumble down 6 more steps, fearing so much that she would be gone at the bottom. It was horrific. 

My heart is so heavy. So much guilt. I was extremely lucky that she was fine, but what if she wasn’t?? These are the thoughts I can’t shake. And the image of her rolling and I can’t help her. What if she broke her neck? What if I would’ve lost her? 

Later in the day, we were playing, and she fell on her face in the kitchen while she was crawling. She busted her top lip a tiny bit since she’s got lots of teeth now. Interesting that this left more of a mark and seemed to hurt her more than rolling down 6-7 wooden stairs. 

I guess this worrying constantly is the norm for the rest of my life. I just feel like an awful mom right now and needed to vent.",yxh8rb,1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yxh8rb/1_year_old_fell_down_the_wood_stairs_today/,parenting
836,Feeling down about where we live,"I’ve been feeling really upset lately about where we have settled. We bought a house in my husbands hometown last year. I have been here permanently for about 8 or 9 years now, but always with the plan that we would move to my hometown or that area and settle there.  We always saw our kids growing up there. When it came time to buy a house last year we were looking in both areas, but since my husband works here he decided we need to stay here. Also his mom provides free daycare for his and his siblings kids. Plus he assured me she would be available to babysit whenever. I was kind of annoyed because he’s mostly remote (only 1-2 days a week in office) and my hometown is only 45 mins- 1 hr away. But I made myself just accept it and try to be happy. Especially since this house is just a 5-7 year plan and we agreed to make our forever home in my hometown. 

It’s a nice neighborhood, and my kindergartener loves his school, but I’m just not happy here. I don’t really have any friends here. It’s so far to get to my family. I’m not working right now and I just feel so alone. Plus I hate this town. It’s so boring, they don’t really have any community events and the town doesn’t have a ton. Plus to get to any decent restaurants or stores we like we have to drive 30-45 minutes through heavily congested roads. I’ve also been annoyed because my mother in law is never available when we need her other than childcare during working hours. His siblings constantly need her for childcare just because mostly and some date nights, vacations, weddings, etc on nights and weekends and we have no one to watch them. My youngest is 3 and the last time we went on a date was 2 months before she was born. I hate asking my mom because it’s a 2 hour round trip for her to come out here and vice versa. My kids are their only grandkids and even though they work full time, they would be able to watch them on nights and weekends when needed. Oh and my husband not even 5 months later got a new job that is fully remote. He almost never has to go in, but if he does, one of their offices is also in my hometown. So I’ve been really annoyed by that. He gaslight me when I mentioned it and said I didn’t put up a fight about where to live 😑. Like he hasn’t also known for years I hate it here. Plus now he’s not sure we should move away from this town because the kids are already in school here. I have a lot going on lately and I’ve been stressed and depressed so I think that’s why it’s bothering me so much more than usual.",yx50au,3,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yx50au/feeling_down_about_where_we_live/,parenting

839,Worried about telling my Doctor that I think I have Postpartum Depression. What to expect?,"NOTE: I will be telling my doctor about it no matter what, I know how serious it can be/get. I’m also not self diagnosing here or anything but personally feel like I have developed postpartum depression. 

Baby is now 1 month old with what seems to be pretty bad colic. I thought it was just baby blues but it is getting more severe and lasting a bit too long to be baby blues. I haven’t felt the need to harm baby or anything. I do however find myself mentally and physically exhausted walking the house for hours on end in tears listening to her screaming despite trying everything to calm her (I’m making and appointment for her tomorrow along with mine to ensure it is colic) With aches and pains from delivery still there along with new ones (Hello back/neck pain).

Her cries kill me inside and I have found my outlook on parenthood and life in general very doom and gloom. Things like: I’m a terrible mother, my child doesn’t/wont love me, I’m a failure, I’m not cut out for this, everyone else just gets it why can’t I etc.

I find I’m getting irritated with my partner daily. Anyone who offers ‘support’ or diminishes my feelings I get very personally hurt by (Comments like ‘It doesn’t last forever’ ‘All babies get colic’ ‘Sleep when the baby sleeps’ etc.) 

I’m severely hating visitors: 1. because I’m trying to establish a routine with baby and it’s proving to be extremely difficult. 2. So many people seem to think it’s okay to come over sick 3. Baby isn’t vaccinated yet 4. Very few are helpful and I find I’m entertaining them (Getting them tea/coffee, offering a snack) 5. I’m extremely sleep deprived and trying to hold a conversation is so hard

I think it’s just all getting overwhelming, my partner is amazing at offering support but does have 2 jobs. He also took the first 3 weeks off to help and it was really helpful but now he’s returned to work I’ve felt the strain. 

I don’t know how postpartum is treated. I’m worried I’ll be hospitalised/committed and the idea of this terrifies me. Will I be reporter to CPS for having it, Will there be frequent house checks? I obviously haven’t harmed baby but I know this happens with PPD so is there a checklist they must follow? I’ve never been on medication for depression is it a one size fits all?

Refuses to wipe most of the time.. and we have been trying everything. Times reminders.. sitting for a few minutes, rewards punishments everything! He LOVES Minecraft and is insanely good at it and it’s his biggest motivator for everything even his teacher told us to use it as a motivator for school work and it has worked great… but not for potty time.. in fact now when he has accidents because he knows he will lose the mine craft for the day he has started hiding his soiled underwear and it’s not just poop anymore it’s pee too.. he hides them in the back of his closet… not sure how long he’s been doing this I only discovered the first stash about 2 months ago and we had a talk about it and I hadn’t seen a stash again until today and I’d been checking… but today there was about 8 pairs hidden some of them SOAKING wet… I don’t even know what to do at this point.

851,WIBTA for not wanting to go to my inlaws' for Christmas?,"Context: We have a 4-year-old and live far away from any family (11-hour drive at least), so my kid rarely gets to see them. My husband is deploying next year and won't be able to visit family for quite a while, so he really wants to drive up this year. He offered to take our daughter and go alone, but would really like me to come.

We did go there for Christmas last year and have done lots of holidays with them - much more than with my family. 

Why I don't want to go:
- I work remotely and the internet connection where we would be staying is terrible, so I'd need to be really creative about where to work. 
- I have limited PTO and don't want to use too much of it hanging out with people I like but don't really enjoy spending time with. I also need to save as much PTO as possible for when my husband is gone. 
- My inlaws love to get together and eat and drink all day, which I absolutely hate (like some is fine, but not exclusively). I always feel incredibly claustrophobic there, especially in winter. 
- There is ALWAYS some giant blow-out at some point when everyone gets too trashed. 
- IMO, holidays are just a day and I'm fine celebrating afterwards with my immediate family.

But the biggest reason (and why I think I'm being somewhat selfish) is that it's hugely inconvenient to get up there and I won't have a good time (I have tried so hard to be a good sport in the past, but just never have that great of a time no matter what). I feel like I should maybe bite the bullet for my husband's sake. He can go with just our daughter, but it would obviously be a giant pain for him.

I’m currently drinking mint tea to soothe my throat (along with cough drops). She’s fussy because her tonsils are swollen, I gave her a SMALL slip of mint tea and she quieted for a minute or so. Would I be able to give her the tea, warm obviously, in her sippy cup? I don’t want her to suffer with a sore throat and I think tea might be a pretty good option. Will it harm her? I have Lipton regular tea, Twinings Lemon & ginger, pure mint and raspberry pomegranate. I barely put any sugar and she has a baby shark TIN sippy with a straw that she uses so it’ll stay warm either way, do you think this will be alright? Just for while she’s sick?

EDIT: I followed the comments, it’s caffeine free because I can’t have caffeine. I gave her an 8oz of warm mint tea and she does sound a bit better than she did 20 minutes ago! She enjoys the tea and is drinking it slowly, she’s now making small “papapa” noises so I’m assuming it did help! Thank you all!",yxdidi,0,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yxdidi/will_mint_tea_harm_her/,parenting
855,Advice for a regressing sensory child,"Let me start by saying my son is in therapy 3 times per week and they tell me he is progressing there. I just want to know from some of you all of this is a common situation and how I can approach it in a fun/gentle way because I feel like I’m losing the plot. My son has a sensory processing disorder heavily food texture related, and since he has began going to therapy some of the things we had stability with have regressed, such as meal times. Kiddo has food fixations where he only wants specific things for a meal and if the meals aren’t safe foods, he would rather starve than eat them if he is made to take a bite he will gag. Lately he is shrinking his list of safe foods and falling to bare basics of meals, and I’m worried the lack of variety will start causing issues with growth and development. Examples of current safe foods are spaghetti, plain turkey sandwiches, peas, and pizza. Things he has regressed away from are peanut butter sandwiches, pop tarts, granola bars, generally veggies in all varieties. He does eat a pretty balanced diet where I hide things within the meals so he gets what he needs but the options are pretty limited in what I can get him to even try anymore. Textures are a big problem and liquid based things are the biggest battle like soups, whipped cream, and milkshakes. Does anyone have any ideas or experiences where they were able to disguise foods in a way that wasn’t noticeable to a finicky kiddo, while we allow therapy to work through the root of the issue? I have talked to his pedi about the lack of a balanced diet and there wasn’t a ton of concern for the moment he is well over his age height and weight range but i am still a worried parent.",yxdfui,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yxdfui/advice_for_a_regressing_sensory_child/,parenting
856,Am I wrong to repurpose my kids birthday presents?,"My kid got an overwhelming number of gifts for his birthday. Between us, friends,and family, he received over 50 packages. He hasn't even opened the majority of them. When he does open one, he gets so excited, he forgets about the others and that gift occupies him for a loooong time. 

With Xmas quickly approaching, would I be wrong to ""steal"" a few birthday presents, rewrap them and pretend santa delivered it? 

My H does not agree with me. He thinks it's tacky. I think it's smart to keep the clutter down.",ywx5re,7,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ywx5re/am_i_wrong_to_repurpose_my_kids_birthday_presents/,parenting
857,How do I make the most of maternity leave?,"I have a fairly short maternity leave (4 weeks) before I’ll be returning to work after having my baby.

858,WWYD?,"Currently overseas. Wife and daughter at a different city and I am catching up with childhood friends until tomorrow. 

Part of me is saying take two additional days by yourself and chill, re-charge and absolutely do nothing but sleep.

Another part of me is, go back to your family, cuddle, laugh etc.

Parenting is not easy we all know this and my body is actually telling me to take the two days alone time, binge watch some crappy shows, walk around the city, mall by yourself and just chill.

Im torn. Any advise? This is the first holiday we’ve had in 10 years.",yxckqx,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yxckqx/wwyd/,parenting
859,Would it be tacky to not get gifts for our 1yo twins this Christmas?,"Not as any kind of punishment or deprivation, just to clarify. My husband and I are bringing the twins to my mother’s this Christmas, and the whole family is coming. They’re the only babies in my generation and I know they’re just going to get showered with presents from immediate and extended family who hasn’t met them yet. We are trying to keep toys to a minimum in general, and just got them a bunch of new clothes since they’re outgrowing things quickly. 

I was thinking of doing stockings for them full of snacks, and picking up some cute Christmas outfit for them to wear on Christmas morning and then leaving it at that. They’re too young to notice or care, but I’d love to hear what you fine folks would think of some new parents who just let everyone else buy presents for their babies? Is this reasonable or totally weird?",yw7e7b,234,236,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/yw7e7b/would_it_be_tacky_to_not_get_gifts_for_our_1yo/,parenting
860,Didn’t make the team,"My 5th grader tried out for the basketball team at school today. They’ve been bringing their ball to school every day this school year to practice, and have been wanting to be on the team so badly. They didn’t make it. I feel so horrible for my baby. There is a rec league in the city they can play for, but tonight they went to bed with so much disappointment and sadness. I just wish I could take it away. This sucks. I’m trying to be supportive and present and figure out what are the right things to say but it feels like not enough 😔",ywhom8,55,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ywhom8/didnt_make_the_team/,parenting
