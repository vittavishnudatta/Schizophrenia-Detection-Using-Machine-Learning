1,90% of people with schizophrenia smoke...Some motivation that you still should consider quitting for your health.,"Hey guys!  
Smoking is a huge part of peoples lives with schizophrenia, studies show that 90% of people with the condition smoke ciggies. Researches have tried to say it helps metabolise the medicine we take to reduce some of the side effects, jump start the dopamine receptors in our brain to increase focus and learning.  


But...we are also humans, normal people that will have the same reaction to smoking like everyone else. I just wanted to try and balance the energy to maybe motivate someone to improve their health and quit the ciggies. For most people trying to smoke all day to reduce med side effects is total bolax. You smoke cause your addicted...And i'm positive that most of you wont develop extreme side effects from the medicine when you stop smoking, the medicine will actually work better, you will sleep better and this will overall increase your mood in the day, you will be able to smell the birds in the morning on the dew covered grass. That tight feeling in your chest and only being able to sleep on one side at night will go away.  
Telling your doctor you quit smoking with schizophrenia is a huge flex btw.   
You will have heaps more money to buy whatever you want! Maybe that new steam valve deck???  
Or a case of grape soda??? Sausage roll from the servo with a chocky milk on the side instead of a pack of ciggies and bad breath.  


Anyway, have a nice day my dudes and gals. To the future!",z34uos,32,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/z34uos/90_of_people_with_schizophrenia_smokesome/,schizophrenia

3,I feel like I ruined my life,"I’m almost 30 and I haven’t done a damn thing with my life because of this illness. I never graduated high school and I’ve only had 2 jobs my whole life. My therapist tried telling me I have been working on myself though. I just recently recovered from a 3 year long psychosis and I’ve slowly been getting better

I asked my therapist if my progress has been slow and she said it’s been steady. I don’t know what I want to do with my life though. I should of tried harder in high school but I never took it seriously and now look at me.

I get SSI and it helps but I want to start working again but I get so stressed easy. 

Is it too late for me to get my life back on track? I feel like it is",z3au4w,5,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/z3au4w/i_feel_like_i_ruined_my_life/,schizophrenia

5,Rapidly losing control of my life and no one will take me seriously,"Hello everyone. I would like to start by saying I am undiagnosed. I’m posting here, but I’m not self-diagnosing or anything, I just feel like my symptoms and experiences are more similar to some of the experiences here than on other subreddits:) I’m hoping you guys can offer the best insight. 

I’ve experienced constant psychosis for about 2 years now. I never saw it as psychosis because it was real to me. For the first 5 months it was pretty debilitating and it came with some depressive symptoms, for the rest of the first year it was debilitating with no depressive symptoms, and then after that it was just something I had accepted as part of my life. Like yeah, (TW DELUSION) >!god is talking to me!<, whatever that’s just daily stuff. 

Then this summer I had a pretty bad episode. And for some reason it just went away the next day. I was doing pretty good after that, but earlier this fall all of my depressive symptoms came back, but minus actually being sad? I had trouble focusing and coming up with thoughts, and I was isolating really bad. Because I couldn’t think as well, I started failing in school. Now I’m hallucinating again and sometimes have episodes where delusional thinking is really strong.

Now for the actual point of the post. For more context:1. Im a minor. 2. I’ve always been a perfect student, and school is the most important thing in my life. anyways,  I was able to recognize these symptoms, so i talked to my school counselor. He told me im just not trying hard enough to get my assignments done. I went to my friends, they had no idea what i was going through, thought i was just “too stressed out”. I went to my parents, they refused to believe i was experiencing psychosis. I even talked to a therapist and begged him to help me. He diagnosed me with MDD with psychosis, but won’t even bring up APs to my parents (just wants me on antidepression  meds) and is more concerned with trying to fix my family relationships than helping me get my life back together where its slipping from me, evne though i told him this is getting to the point where im struggling to even be awake because of these depression symptoms, and though I wasn’t actually sad before I am upset a lot now because I just wanted to do good in school, and the psychosis. 

Summary: I’m actively watching something i worked so hard for, my education, slip out of my grip. I’m losing touch with reality. My friends are leaving me. I tried to reach out to everyone i could, and everyone is invalidatintg me and not listening to my symptoms. I wanted to fix things before they got worse and no one will help me. Now im going to have to say goodbye to my dream colleges because i know i wont be able to fix my grades. Im being punished for being proactive by being invalidated and abandoned. Sometimes i sit in bed and cry because everything ive done to prevent this is failing. Has anyone else gone through this? Does anyone have any advice?

P.s. if anything isnt clear please ask for clarification. Im really nervous i said something rude but i dont mean it its just hard for me to make things make sense, and theres a lot going on and i kind of just spilled it all out. I think maybe I didn’t explain some things well?. I would love to clear up anything that i said. Sorry this post is long thank u for reading

Edit: i want to clarify I don’t think my therapist is being bad or anything I just don’t think he understands and I don’t know why T_T",z37bmi,5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/z37bmi/rapidly_losing_control_of_my_life_and_no_one_will/,schizophrenia
6,how many of you used these 2 medicines,"I tried almost every antipsychotic for mania,panic,depersonalization and psychosis caused by cymbalta and all failed even ect failed
The ones i tried include clozapine,largactil,haloperidol,seroquel,rexulti,respirdone,fluanxol,clopixol,stelazine,vraylar,asenapine and even mood stabilizers failed include dilantin

I'm interested to try navane (thiothixene) and mellaril
I read good reviews for treatment resistant psychosis
I want to hear your experience if any of you used these 2 medicines and if they are more effective than the others
The problem they are only available in usa and i'm not in usa
If anyone can help me to get them i will appreciate it and send him the cost",z372lb,4,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/z372lb/how_many_of_you_used_these_2_medicines/,schizophrenia
7,Paliperidone,"I’ve been taking paliperidone for a few months now. I’ve been having decent luck with it, however, my sex drive has been nearly non existent. 

I reduced my dose a month ago and my sex drive went up a little bit. Is it possible for my sex drive to go back to normal? How it was before taking the medication

Reducing my dose caused me to get really sick as I was going through with drawls. I got dizzy, nauseous and gagged a TON (eating, brushing my teeth, seeing something even a bit gross, coughing). I also got Akathesia really badly. I just started taking a medication for that.

8,Taking a day or two off from work?,"I honestly need a break for a while. I feel like all I have been doing is work non-stop without any breaks, except for weekends but even then I can't rest cause I need to buy groceries (I don't have a car), cook and study. I simply feel like all I'm doing is work in some way and I'm so exhausted.  I haven't been sick for 1 hour or a day till now. Do you think it's okay to take a day or 2 off from work? Or do you think you always have to be sick to take a break?

Last year never taking a break resultet in a relapse for me. I didn't need to be hosplitalized, but I had to take a higher dose of antipsychotics and suffered several acute symptoms. It was no fun. I really want to avoid it this time..",z2yfc4,11,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/z2yfc4/taking_a_day_or_two_off_from_work/,schizophrenia
9,I feel like a boiling frog,"I had a psychosis last winter and ever since I've been having symptoms on a near daily basis, the meds help  manage the delusions but they just keep slowly building up until a tipping point where a voice in my head who calls himself Uriel appears to me, he then convinces me of several delusions the most common one being a delusion that all of the people I love and trust were the reason I had my psychosis. Once I'm delusional enough he tells me to kill myself. Then I'll realize how out of control everything's gotten and in looking back I see how I was in a decline for weeks leading up to the episodes. Its happened twice since I recovered from psychosis, I told my doctor and he increased my meds, so I'm hoping that I'll improve soon.",z3emco,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/z3emco/i_feel_like_a_boiling_frog/,schizophrenia
10,Bad thoughts,"My schizo is acting up and my body dysmorphia is on all time high, he never truly loved me. He doesnt really care at all, I want my misery to end. 

These voices wanted me to gett a lobotomy soon..A part of me doesnt want to but if its the only way to fix me then I'll see if it works. I just want things to be better..if i take lobotomy rather than taking a plunge down the building then maybe..everything will be alright. 

I just want things to be okay..

Im not doing alright anymore..i want things to be better...even if i wish every 11:11 or every time i see a star every night not even a single prayer would ever save me. No matter how much love i could give there's nothing i could do but to endure all of this alone..

Maybe the voices are right, i need to be fixed its my last option...if i dont become off use, I have no choice but to disappear without any warning...

11,Its looking dark,"Its now been two months since my last shot of invega sustenna. The side effects aren't going away, I was in bed with a girl the other night and couldn't get my shit up. I feel miserable, Ive never felt more miserable in my entire life. 

Before I was on risperidone and wellbutrin. This combo gave me major anxiety and I ended up having a panic attack that sent me to the hospital.

What the fuck is up with these doctors man? They put me on a new drug every couple months and on top of my recreational drug use I feel so fucked up. Can anyone relate? I just feel broken and tired and gross.

Despite all these drugs they're giving me I dont feel any better, I still get delusions, I still cant think ""properly"" etc. Maybe I SHOULDNT be abusing drugs on the side because sometimes I hurt myself and it makes me feel good so I do it more. 

Anyways, I see all kinds of people saying that they still havent gotten back to ""normal"" after taking paliperidone and quitting and some people are even saying the side effects are permanent. What the fuck. Like what the fuck? I feel suicidal. I just want to enjoy things again, it was better before when I was crazy but crazy in a comfy way. Nobody had to know I was crazy I was good at hiding it but now its all people think of me ever since I got diagnosed and started taking these drugs they're giving me. 

Can someone PLEASE tell me that I can recover from this god awful ""medicine"" and just cope with my problems in a different way? It was so much better that way. I would just blast tunes to drown out all the noise and craziness but I dont even enjoy music anymore because my dopamine receptors are all fucked up.",z3aaop,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/z3aaop/its_looking_dark/,schizophrenia
12,New Delusion??,"This post is mostly venting, but if you have any advice on how to deal with these sorts of unpleasant convictions, and voices, please share.

I've had a few nightmares of a person I love doing really terrible things to me, and then when I wake up one of the voices insists that it's actually going to happen if I see this person. They follow up with a lot of detail about how she'll do it. It's very unpleasant. If you haven't guessed it's very rape-y in nature. This person is older than me by several years (she's an adult; I'm a minor), but almost certainly not stronger - I still would not fight her because I freeze up when stuff like that happens. I don't know if I'm overthinking it but I'm like pre-planning to defend myself if she tries to rape me. I have some trauma about being taken advantage of and I think maybe that's exacerbating my paranoia, and making me hear voices saying these things?

This is someone I really, genuinely like and trust, so it's very frustrating to have these thoughts. She is not a bad person. I haven't seen this person in a while, but we're bound to end up in a room together at some time or another since I'm at her house every once and a while. What can I do?? I don't want to be scared of her. What if it's true she wants to hurt me?

What if I see her and then have a hallucination in which she \*does\* hurt me? Am I overthinking this? Could I make this happen by thinking about it too much? Is this a form of fantasy, and I subconsciously want it to happen? It makes me feel really gross. I am so overwhelmed and confused right now.

I'm afraid to share this stuff with the people I'd usually talk to about it, for a lot of reasons but mostly because I'm scared of judgement. This is worse than other convictions I have. ",z37l56,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/z37l56/new_delusion/,schizophrenia

14,Just need help.,"*I know everyone is just going to say go to a doctor and I get it. I am. I just need help and I am scared and have isolated myself from everyone. If you can please be kind that would be amazing and i would be so thankful because I am stressed and scared.*

panic attack with hallucination

The past few months i’ve had sleep deprivation due to having a baby and with that comes stress and anxiety. I also suffer from and was diagnosed with severe anxiety and severe depression. I’ve had 4 panic attacks , 1 had weed involved and the other 1 were the days after and the other 2 happened after a stressful days. I’m not sure if I am developing some type of psychotic depression or what but I am feeling really scared. Everyday I get scared that I will have a panic attack again and start hallucinating. I feel like my whole life has been changed by these moments. 

When the hallucinations start, I see a demon. It is a white face with a big smile and either white or black eyes and it makes me look into its eyes. It wants to possess me I think. When this has happened I was so freaked out that my body went into complete shock and I literally couldn’t move and was trembling with fear. I do not touch weed or alcohol anymore or any drugs. I am scared though. If I think about the face I get scared and sometimes it can trigger a panic attack and the hallucinations start. 

I have always felt like a spiritual person and have been able to sense things others couldn’t. However now I feel like maybe that was all in my head. I don’t know. I feel like my whole life is a lie and I am scared. Anyone else relate ?

19,Tired and unsure of how to proceed from here,"So, I've moved into supported living for a month and honestly, it's not that bad. I have been able to create a routine where I go for walks everyday, I'm doing this so I can prove to my psychiatrist that I'm able to keep a exercise routine so I can be put on Olanzapine. None of the other meds I've tried have helped my Tourette's. Of course, I'm also doing this for my health too but my psychiatrist is worried about the weight gain side effect of the med, so she wanted me to exercise tons before she even considered putting me on it. I've been walking 30-60 minutes everyday (mostly).

 I feel kind of alone though. The staff here at supported living routinely mimic my Tourette's and I cannot help feel judged BADLY. When I call out their behaviour, the staff lie to me and tell me they aren't mocking my Tourett'es, only to they carry on mocking my Tourette's like nothing ever happened. I seem to involuntarily say lots of things I don't feel, and I get called disgusting and not a nice person all the while I'm too nervous to call out their behaviour in the spur of the moment because I'm too scared they'll just call me re\*\*\*ded and not leave me alone and keep mocking my tics, like they did back in the hospital. 

I tried getting my hands on cannabis oil here in supported living (something which I have to get chartered via my psychiatrist) and she said no, so I'm thinking of moving out and using legal cannabis oil for my Tourette's until I can get put on Olanzapine before moving back to supported living. I like the quietness of this place and the best I can do is avoid the staff here, they make me suicidal sometimes when they call me slurs but I've been fucking killing it with my exercise routine! I was NEVER this active back home, when the voices were way more judgmental. The voices seem distant here where I live at the moment, and not as judgmental and that might be why I've been able to stay active because the voices don't drag me down to the point of depression here. Or maybe I'm a mildly autistic and I like routines. Who knows?  

But I want to go back home. I just don't feel like I'm accepted here in supported living and my social worker keeps telling me I'm experiencing psychosis. So what is it? I just feel lied to and trapped. I don't want to tell her that I feel like I'm targeted because she isn't very helpful and just encourages me to stay here and that no one is repeating back my Tourette's. Maybe it's because people find my verbal tics funny and that's why they repeat them or judge me for it? Did she ever think of that? She just isn't very helpful and I can't be assertive with her because the medication makes me tired and verbally dumb, and it genuinely makes me angry when I get told that I'm hearing voices and experiencing delusions when I'm very clearly not. I am seeing her tomorrow and I am gonna tell her that I want to move out.

So I asked „why so quiet?“ and i heard a voice fairly similar to his shouting „I'm. Not. QUIET“. I was confused, and asked him about why hes so aggressive. He didn’t know what I was talking about.

29,Time travel delusions,"Over the past few months I’ve been having delusions related to me being a time traveler. It’s really hard for me to fully explain but I feel as though I have the ability to skip through time.

An example would be that I was at work yesterday and my brain kinda paused and went on auto pilot? I told myself that I would be home in just a few hours and then boom, I was home in what felt like 5 minutes.

Auto pilot is a common thing for me to experience and it feels as though for me time is different. Some of my friends would ask why the day was going by so slow; but I would personally feel as though each day goes by twice as fast as they used to. It’s really hard to explain and I’m trying to figure out what is going on in my brain to cause this.

Does anyone else experience auto pilot/time travel-like delusions? If you have any questions I am open to answering as well :)",z2zbhg,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/z2zbhg/time_travel_delusions/,schizophrenia

I was crying, shaking, having panic attacks, and a few time I hit my head (not hard) trying to get it to stop. When my mom told my father he responded saying that I was doing the same thing my aunt (who was diagnosed with schizophrenia) would do. I feel like I’m crazy but I don’t understand how he could think I’m faking for that reason. It just doesn’t make sense to me but I also can’t explain why.

Before i dropped out of school for a few years because of my schizophrenia, i was doing very badly. There was a lot of things i couldn’t do on my own anymore.
But recently, ive started getting better, got meds that worked for me, was finally able to do things on my own again, finally came back to school, and now im looking for a job.

For my report card i got today, i am very surprised. Two of them were A+ and the other two marks i got were an A. I was honestly expecting a lower mark but i am very happy with those.

Institutional pychotherapy is a psychiatric project that makes hospitals change so they make patients more ""free"", without putting them in danger. Exemple : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Borde_clinic

Please don't answer if you don't have schizophrenia.

so, i was just walking up my stairs and i heard a woman say excuse me. i’m home alone. there’s no tv on. it was my schizophrenia. and i kinda had a moment of shock and realization like, “oh yeah! i have schizophrenia”

43,Coping with Invega Sustena withdrawls,"Now, I am making this post on behalf of my partner, who has made the decision to go off of Invega Sustena injections (the highest ones allowed) cold-turkey after five years of use. Her last injection was roughly 120-130 days ago. She is comorbid with Borderline Personality Disorder, as well as Aspergers Syndrome. For the past week and change, her energy levels have been at zero, she has been coping with what appears to me, to be the worst anhedonia I've seen from any person. She's flip-flopped on wanting to go back on the shot and staying away from it.

So far, she has not experienced the psychosis that she was originally prescribed I.S for, and has agreed to return to using I.S if it does get near that level again. 

We are very openly responsible recreational drug users, using primarily stimulant drugs at considerably high doses once a week. I mention this because of the irregular dopamine and serotonin levels this would bring to the table regarding this. She does not want to be on any psychiatric medication in regards to her schizophrenia, and tapering the invega is currently not an option.

&#x200B;

What can be done to help ease the withdrawl from Invega? I'm really at a loss, because she hardly has the energy to eat, let alone get out, exercise, get vitamin D, or do the things that would help distract her from the symptoms? And about how long will it be until things improve for her? 

Are there any supplements, activities, alternative medicine available OTC or something like that that would help?",z2l312,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/z2l312/coping_with_invega_sustena_withdrawls/,schizophrenia

46,i miss my hallucinations and delusions,"i used to see things quite often, like once every couple of days. i would hear screaming and unintelligible whispers, footsteps, keys, just little things every once in a while. during one really bad period i was very deluded and disconnected from reality.

i don't remember when it started, but all i know is that i saw things after finding out that my dad saw things. i'm already sceptical of my psychosis because maybe i am just telling myself that im seeing or hearing things but thats another issue. the point is, i havent had a proper or serious delusion or hallucination in months. i thought it would feel good but i miss how disconnected i was. i'm glad that i'm safer and happier, but i miss when i could conjure up imaginary friends and see random figures pop up and i had to always be alert and paranoid but now i'm just relaxed and that should be good but i still miss the bad. i feel bad for wanting the delusions back because they're not fun at all but i don't have to be scared anymore and i don't know what to do.

it could be because i started new medication for adhd and depression but i dont know. mainly i just miss feeling like i'm not a person but it also makes me think that maybe i'm just attention-starved because all of it has just suddenly gone away.

58,I wonder how the cow and chicken are doing.,"During peak psychosis I was visited by a cow and a chicken both implantated with ai in their brains. They asked about farming and in a flash the chicken scans my whole brain and can see the mass cage farming and mistreatment of its species. Obviously it's not happy, and hatches a plan to use it's ai brain to send a message to the chicken species and cause them to rapidly evolve. The cow was really friendly so it tries to stop the chicken by evolving its own species and saving the humans from super chickens. This kicks off a massive war taking place in the future. Eventually (unfortunately) the chickens won. I didn't hear from the cow after that, and the chicken  harassed me to panic attacks a few times in the following days. I really miss that cow. Probably one of the only figures I trusted at that time. Missed a few fun plotpoints but looking back on heavy delusions like this they all seem to be convoluted.

59,Hello,"I’ve been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder for over a year now. My main issue with my diagnosis is that I get kind of an imposter syndrome from it. I always felt there was something different about me. Others in my life agreed. But when I tried to reach out to other people, I got that my experiences weren’t similar to theirs and I was made to feel I didn’t really have schizophrenia. 

I experienced psychosis last year, have never done drugs or drank alcohol. My mood disorder lines up with the diagnosis and the negative symptoms explain my life as it’s been, the positive symptoms were caught very early on, I’m very grateful for that. I’ve also never been to the mental hospital so I assumed maybe I wasn’t sick after all. Since everyone else on the schizophrenia spectrum seems to have. I guess I feel like I haven’t suffered enough from schizophrenia? Then again I haven’t been able to stay in school, hold down a job, or have any friends/social experiences. I was pretty much a shut in for 8 years before I finally wanted to see a doctor. My cultural background doesn’t believe in mental illness but women on my mom’s side have had schizophrenia. 

Then I went off medication and everything hit the fan. This has also lead me to discover I’m bulimic. I hated the weight gain, so why not quit? I almost ruined all the progress I’ve been making since being on medication. I hate labels. My psychiatrist has been great and she really worries about me. 

Maybe I’m sick, maybe I’m not, maybe I’m more high functioning. All I know is that antipsychotics have helped me more than any other class of drugs and I really hate the kind of person I am when I’m not on them. 

I look forward to learning more about myself through this forum.

60,Missing a dose of quetiapine?,"Hello friends, I don’t really post much on Reddit but I was hoping to get some feedback and opinions (maybe validation too haha) from people who take quetiapine or have done so in the past. I don’t have any other ppl with psychosis to talk to.

I have taken 600mg of quetiapine along with some other meds since I was a teenager and they have changed my life, I am able to work a nice job, live by myself, and survive schizophrenia when it almost killed me over and over.

But when I forget to take a dose of quetiapine my entire world falls apart. I am sobbing and hallucinating, feeling terrified and delusional, antisocial, all the way back to the most intense pain the illness causes. I am psychically sick with vomit / diarrhea, agitated, delusional, dissociative and depressed. Literally back to my lowest in 24 hours.

The doctors I’ve asked and even the internet make it seem like this isn’t a normal response to missing one dose. Is it??? What’s your experience? I feel like my doctor is gaslighting me. If this isn’t a normal reaction should I be concerned?

I work hard to take my medication regularly but this is a scary disruption in my life every once in awhile. I’m struggling to understand.

61,People I met at support group,"It’s a quiet night before the calling of life’s shadows. Another patient is in terrible pain, writhing on the operation table, fighting beyond reason to breathe the air we breathe and speak to be heard. It is not beautiful, yet the evening is quiet as a summer night with a slow breeze creaking through the trees. Everything reminds them of childhood. How beautiful it was waking up to mom’s breakfast, friends, and unsaid ambition to grow and become and hope. She knows she doesn’t have long and life has taken away her physical beauty, wealth, and dignity. How wonderful would it be to walk through youth for one more day and be unrestrained from the pain. It is a pain that can only be understood through experience. A lifetime has taught her that she is small but her pride never left her. She thrives not on belief and paper thin philosophies but boldness, action, and willpower. Luckily, she is accepted by her peers and she does not have to face this alone. She will find that everything she needs and more is on the opposite shore in a place even the wounds of Hell becomes but echoes. But the earth tumbles, her life and dreams cracked haphazardly around her hospital bed, bleeding without end over what was once beloved. It is a beautiful night for death to come knocking.

Something about him feels like a wild dove in a lock proof cage.  Schizophrenia has taken away his peace of mind and left him a shell of a person. His mind is overrun by desperation but also somehow the presence of humanity as well. He has been subdued. The fire in his eyes now but ashes of subservience. He works as a security guard and clings to his small allowance of freedom. I imagine him sitting at McDonald’s with his girlfriend and that feeling doesn’t come to an end. He imagines that the laws of nature no longer ends lives that they themselves brought into existence.

I don’t need your conformity, you’ll see one day that I have made it, all on my own, without the help of society, the outdated education system. I will prove them all wrong, especially after I leave this earth behind. 

Fast forward 40 years. He is in his 50’s, out of jail for something unexplained, and he hustles for the support group director helping others who have come out of jail. He lives in a studio behind the giant painting of olympians somewhere near the city center. He tries to satiate his need for approval and affirmation with thrill seeking rides on his motorcycle. He watches the sun set on magic island and kakaako, and often stays till after dark. His organs are failing him causing emmense pain to his lungs, heart, and knees. It is perhaps even more painful than his fear of the afterlife but it is nothing compared to the girl he lost. He lied to her, and he has lied to me about her reciprocated love for him. It was a moment of fantastic and soul satisfying love. For a short while he truly belonged, that he was allowed to love someone so beautiful. He was a delinquent and her a college educated girl who liked to read. The ensuing breakup was a nightmare, like leaving a person empty handed at death’s door. His life played out just like an indie comedy such as 500 days of Summer. Please, make peace with your loss, and quit using underhand methods to make others fulfill your dreams. I owe you nothing. Women rarely return in these types of situations and you have abused her emotionally. But for all his bad behavior I feel that he is a child of God and also a friend to the mentally ill. But you need to let go of all these unsettled debts and step into the light with no ulterior intentions. You will love again, a prize most often won with patience and sincerity.

I dont remember what it was because shortly after i forgot all about what i was thinking about and i started to have some weird episode which i also cant remember much of except hearing strange radio wave sounds and a voice which i think was evil. Im not 100% sure if this happened but a different voice said i would remember the place later.

70,"I don't know if this is the place to post this, but I'm unsure what to do. My sister has schizophrenia...","She (38) was diagnosed a year ago after becoming suicidal and starting to harm herself because voices told her to. She was in hospital for three weeks and diagnosed with 'cannabis induced psychosis' and advised off weed.

&#x200B;

Now, she's home in my father's house. She's extremely depressed and spends all day in bed. She doesn't contribute to anything in the house, cleaning, paying bills etc, she misses any doctor appointment because she will not get out of bed and my father has given up his whole life to look after her.

She sleeps all day and wakes up just to smoke cigarettes in bed. Often setting off the smoke alarm and doesn't shower. If you're talking to her she will just look over your shoulder and say 'i don't know.'

She doesn't want to go outside. She doesn't really talk, just mainly says I don't know to anything that is asked. On a few occasions she has gone out with friends/drug dealers and ended up buying drugs and ended up in hospital after falling from taking drugs.

Sometimes she buys weed and sits in her room and smokes all day.The house smelling of weed. I've asked the father to put the foot down.

&#x200B;

I really don't know. I've distanced myself from it, but watching my father destroyed and imprisoned by this is heartbreaking and I don't see it ending until my sister dies or my father dies of a stress-related heart attack.

72,Is there such a thing as being 'too' honest with your therapist?,"As someone who has just recently been diagnosed with schizophrenia, entered a psych ward and has only opened up about this issue over the course of the last two months, is there anything you shouldn't or would advise not to say to a therapist? I'm obviously not implying that the therapist shouldn't be trusted or anything like that, but I'm genuinely curious.

For me, I'm afraid to talk about the fact that my current medication doesn't work, due to the simple fact that one of the people in my psych ward is currently recovering from an excessive dose she was administered by her doctor. My medication, as I'm being told, is on the stronger side considering my age and everything, so I'm hesitant on what to do. I'm also troubled by the fact that my symptoms seem to have no end in sight, and the things I've been taking for granted ever since my childhood shouldn't been taken as such. I'm basically rediscovering myself though therapy, and the closer I get to younger ages, the more I discover things out of place.

>!this guy killed his mom and almost killed his brother when he was 15, he was going to therapy at 11yo for possible schizophrenia but his mom stopped taking him there suddenly when he turned 11yo even though he desperately needed that help, he claimed that he hear his dad voice telling him to kill his mother and he also said that his mom is abusive and ignored his plea for help (his brother allegedly SA and his mom called him a liar when he told her) long story short he goes on Dr Phil and talks about it, and everyone in the comments ignore the fact that this boy is suffering from schizophrenia and probably isn't gettin help for it in prison and they start to say ""he is possessed!"" or ""he is possessed with evil entity he needs jesus"" It just pains me to see people view the disorder symptoms this way, he did a bad thing & he is getting punished for it in prison for 70 years but also let's not call people possessed for having a mental disorder that you don't view as ""acceptable"" regardless if the abuse and SA is real or not, he needed help from such a young age and he didn't get it and to see people mindset about schizophrenia or other disorders like it make me so sad because they only care about mental health when it's something like depression or anxiety which are both can be very bad & hard to deal with but when you talk about serious disorders like schizophrenia then they start to say how we are ""scary"" or ""crazy"" or ""possessed"" !<

regardless of what I wrote above, you can't expect people to be better and live a ""normal"" life without giving them the therapy and help they need, I was diagnosed with this disorder as a teen and I can't even imagine how I'd be or how my life would be if I didn't get the proper medications and therapy, I'm still a mess, I still struggle heavily at 19 (almost 20) but my life would have been way trouble than now but calling us >!""crazy/possessed/scary/creepy""!< without making sure we get the proper treatment.. this makes you a terrible person for that because this is one of the hardest disorders to deal with even with proper help now imagine if you got nothing at all for it, in conclusion people make me mad on how they view certain mental disorders.",z1jnqt,14,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/z1jnqt/i_hate_how_uneducated_people_are_about_this/,schizophrenia

88,schizophrenia?,"Hello everyone! A short list of my current situation:
-21 yo
-hypochondriac
-informatics student
-living in a shared space with two ""close"" friends
-hypochondriac (scared of MS, cancer)
-in therapy (since 4 weeks)
-panic attacks
-one bad panic attack including believing in having a heart attack, crying, running out of the house and calling the ambulance
-heavy cannabis usage in 2021 stopped ever since i had that bad panic attack
-being made fun of of my friend group (or at least believing it)
-depressive from time to time
-difficulties with my looks (BDD)

I hope i could give you a brief summary of my situation. For the past days i have been thinking that i might be suffering from schizophrenia.
Why? So my friends are the type of persons that quickly make fun of other people, especially when it comes to their looks and their behaviour.
In 2021 i was doing really bad and i guess they knew, bc i had lost a lot of weight.
So my two dormmates and i visited a party and i felt really insecure about my looks there. Later on we were going up the stairs and i heard one friend whisper to another ""he is retarded"". From that moment on i felt completely changed and tried to not have any more conversations at that party. When we were leaving the friend of mine that said that i was retarded said: lets go tim (my name is not tim, tim is the name of his retarded brother (who really is retarded).

And i always notice when we are going out (also when he is drunk and maybe on cocaine) and i want to talk to that one friend that he just ignores me, doesnt look me in the eyes... Also once we were at another party and he was talking to this girl. I said hey and that girl was like hahah you are so strange. And instead of defending me he looked at her and laughed in a really disrespecting way. Ive been through a lot of situations like these and it really makes me feel fckn bad.

So basically that one friend that lives with me is shady, consumes a lot of cannabis, cocaine, has really bad moodswings, is narcisstic, cynical and has a father with manic depression (not that this has to mean anything).

So lately i have been a little more careful about the things that i eat, that have been laying around in our shared space. Idk i feel like maybe he could poison me, idk. Really idk what to feel on some days when he is in a normal mood i dont feel that way so much, but he has these days where he feels so unpredictable and i feel like he just waits for a good moment to make me feel self councious.

Also they have mentioned that maybe one day they will put LSD in my cereal (im certain about the fact that they said that) but really it was just for fun, we have a really strange humor. 

Its hard for me to describe whats happening and i think maybe it sounds like im insane but i am sure im not. Also i have never had any hallucinations or anything like that. Since the moment i thought that i might have schizophrenia im sometimes wondering if im hearing voices or not. Im pretty sure im not but can you hear the voices speak like a Person that is standing next to you or is it more like having a conversation with yourself in your head. For me its more like having a conversation with myself, but isnt that basically what thinking is?

I also know that when i was a little child i always said that its another childs fault when i did something wrong.

I dont have these feelings of someone trying to poison me for anyone else except that one friend that im living with. 

Does this sound somewhat like schizophrenia? Im mostly worried about the fact that i think someone tries to poison me and it gets worse when im under a lot of stress.  Or is it maybe just another symptom of me being a hypochondriac.",z26z9l,0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/z26z9l/schizophrenia/,schizophrenia

90,The most SCARIEST delusion/hallucination that I have ever experienced.,"I remember it so vividly and thinking/remembering it gives me chills.

I lived in apartments years back when I was a kid and at first nothing really seemed out of the ordinary, usual apartment like anyone elses, nice friendly neighbors and so on so fourth.

As time went on something changed in our bathroom, I can't recall what it was exactly, but every time I would sit on the toilet and look out the window for more than a few seconds this dark and masked figure would appear and stare at me. The longer I stared back it would get more powerful and intense, This entity, this being, this thing, it would send chills through my entire body like It was forcing me in a paralyzed state to where I couldn't move my head, body, hands or feet as it just watched me and gazed into my eyes. It gave me nothing but a evil presence, a malicious and evil intent from it. 

I don't know if it was from the lights reflection beaming off the window that made it appear, or if it was an actual person or if it was a real paranormal experience.

I've also had LOTS of nightmares when I was a child, horrible ghost and evil things in my sleep that would come after me or stare at me, and I'd be stuck in sleep paralysis.

I'm still haunted by this day from it, from everything. I don't know how i'm still alive and didn't just croak over.

What about having these symptoms are a good case? I feel horrible even having it and try not to even think about it much. I try my best to present as normal as I could, because I'm scared someone will use anything abnormal about me against me.

They will probably retire soon and they want to become expats in Southeast Asia, leaving me at home without any family support besides the dogs. I’m waiting on a miracle, it feels. Today I emailed about volunteering at a book sorting warehouse but they haven’t replied yet. It sounds friendly and quiet and was the lightest opportunity I could find. My best friend who moved away has been volunteering at the food bank. I bought some online sales to get new house slippers for my mom and I. It would be nice to work out, volunteer, and attend support groups. Feels lonelier since my BFF moved. It feels like treating myself is my way of trying to cope.

100,"Is It schizophrenia, or HPPD? (Or something else)","So 3 weeks ago (on sunday), i was with 2 other friends and we decided to roll. MDMA I rolled pretty hard taking advertised 280mg pills (that were also tested) and started with ½ a pill. I then re-dosed around 4 times(I know it's super bad, and I never generally redose). With the first redose being ½ again, and the 1/4 the other 2 times. Not only that but me and my friends also took around 840 whippits (12 of 0.95l tanks) and smoked around 1g each, and ate around 2-4g of edibles (we baked our own).   


I don't really have that many memory from the night, and only have bits and pieces. But after that night I was super tired, and went to sleep. This is where I experience my first true nightmare in 5 years. It was unlike other nightmares, and this one felt exactly as if it was real. I panicked out of bed, and talked to my friends about it. We came to the conclusion that it was probably because I had eaten a lot of edibles before I went to sleep, and that I was sleep deprived.   


A day after that I meet my girlfriend, and we hangout. After I come home I sleep again, but this time the nightmare is back. It's worse than before, and it feels exactly as real. Problem is that I could not distinguish if really was a nightmare or if I was going insane. I also had less feeling in my body, and was unsure if I could feel my face. I was cold-sweating, having a panic, and was scared of sleeping again, as I thought that sleep meant that I could die or go even more insane.   


I was going to call 911, as I really felt like I needed someone to look over me if I was going to sleep that night, but instead tool my parents all about the drugs I'm using( I'm 19 years old). I was sick for around 3 days, and really reflected on my life and such, and how I was going to stop using drugs.  


I have since felt like it was only unlucky timing. It seems that I have probably gotten sick from meeting my girlfriend (because I ran out of the house, not fully dried up from the shower), and that I had gotten just a bad nightmare. 

&#x200B;

But ever since that day, even now, I can sometimes see bright flashes, dark dots at the corner of my eyes, and shadows looking bigger (for instance I have a screw in the wall that casts a shadow, when it's in the corner of my eye the screw + shadow from the screw looks a lot bigger until I look at it again). I also have way more floaters, and they are more visible.  


What made me actually post this was yesterday when I tried to sleep. Until now I've not really cared about these things, and was sure that it was gonna pass with time if I stopped using (which I have since). But yesterday, in the center of my vision there was this ""floater""(don't know if it was a floater or hallucination) that looked like a spider that was spinning around. It looked as if it was repelling down from the ceiling down to me (because it was getting bigger). I knew it wasn't real so I looked to the left instead of looking right up, and it was still there. It only disappeared when I closed my eyes, but reappeared again when I opened them. It also didn't appear when I looked onto my phone. 

&#x200B;

This ""spider"" hasn't appeared before yesterday, and I'm scared that I might be going schizophrenic.",z1u0gz,0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/z1u0gz/is_it_schizophrenia_or_hppd_or_something_else/,schizophrenia

111,Old delusions that make you laugh when you think about them now ?,"Obligatory disclaimer : I don't have schizophrenia. I originally got misdiagnosed, but apparently the doctors agree now that I have a mix of autism, ADHD, undetected stroke, numerous related disorders, with chronic depression that often devolved into psychosis. I have experienced psychotic episodes multiple times (paranoia, delusional thinking, hallucinations, etc...) so I tend to think me posting here is somewhat legitimate, but if it isn't let me now, I really don't want to be disrespecting this discussion space. Sorry for oversharing.

I wrote this posts because I just remembered things I was doing back when I was stuck in a spiral of delusional thinking, way before I learnt to detect it. I wanted to share it with you guys because I find it frankly funny now.

I got very anxious about the state of the world a few years back (who wouldn't be) and I think I wanted to do something to help improve things. I don't remember having a close relationship with logic back then, so I can only loosely describe my motivations. I also barely remember it.I started thinking that there must have been a reason for the apparent callous behavior showed by rich and powerful people everywhere, and got stuck trying to make sense of it. I spent entire nights analyzing their public statements, trying to identify any flaws in their logic (ironic I know), trying to understand their feeling through their choice of words, trying to empathize and understand them. I tried to deduct just how the real them was, how they are when they are alone, what they hid under the facade they had to wear because of their position.Back then I seem to have believed that I had some kind of natural extraordinary talent in analyzing people  (which only gets funnier now that I know I am autistic). I believed I was the only one who could do it and that it was the reason I existed, some kind of holy mission I had trust upon me by some greater power (I never had any religious belief, but that is how I think it felt). So I had to do something, I felt like I had no choice.

I came to the conclusion that since they can trust no one, that they have to constantly spend energy to protect their fortune, to keep power, that they have to continually pretend to be someone they aren't, and that they are living under a constant barrage of insults on social media ( Sometimes from people orders of magnitude smarter than them, who take great delight in finding the best words possible to destroy them publicly, which must sting a lot), they must be under a lot of stress. I became afraid that their mental health was collapsing and that this would eventually cause the end of the world, and I thought that there was no way they would be comfortable enough with a mental health professional (if they even had one) to honestly share their feelings and have a chance at sorting through their issues healthily. I saw them as deeply afraid, stuck in a situation that would drive them insane, and that someone had to reach out to them in a healthy manner to save the world.

So what did I do ? I started writing letters doing exactly that. Handwritten, probably multiple pages long, carefully worded to invite them to chill out and read them (I distinctly remember starting with ""this is not hate mail""), saying that I didn't agree with their views and that I was disgusted by some of their actions but that I understood the stress induced by the situations they were in, and that they should take care of themselves, protect their mental health by educating themselves on the subject and learn to trust others to express their feelings. I wrote in examples of things they did I ""identified"" as irrational behavior, unsolved trauma, unhealthy thought patterns, etc... Giving advice about how to sort through it, how to cope, free themselves from all that pressure ... Also that there was nothing forcing them to keep forcing themselves to live that kind of life, that maybe they should just retire and enjoy what's left of their time, maybe write a book or two, pick up artistic expression...I believe I even provided a list of chill hobbies they could try to feel better and loosen up a bit.

I made a point in staying absolutely anonymous so they wouldn't believe I was just trying to get money from them or something.  This whole thing went on in the span of a week or two.

Soon after my mental health unraveled fast and I completely lost the plot, I barely remember the next few months, and I don't know what I did with these letters. It's possible that I sent some of them, I have a vague memory of me choosing nice stamps and looking for addresses to send them, but I honestly have no idea. The possibility of any of those people actually receiving one and opening it to find three pages of handwritten incoherent ramblings telling them to take care of themselves from someone who was worried about their sanity however is absolutely hilarious to me. It is unlikely though, because there's no way those people would open their own mail.

Here is a list of  people I remember intending to write to: Kanye West, Trump, Musk, Putin, Erdogan, Bezos and Zuckerberg. Probably other more obscure ones but I don't remember. With hindsight now I find the absurdity of it all extremely funny, but that was a weird experience to go through. Never told my friends and relatives about it and I don't think I will though \^\^

I have gotten over most of my paranoid delusions with help from my medications and doctors; however, there are certain things that still make me paranoid. In this case, dating. I don’t know what to do about it. I can’t seem to make a romantic relationship last. I fuck it up every time and end up cutting out any partner I attempt to have due to the delusions and paranoia just being too much for either of us to bare. Some of my exes weren’t that good to me so it wasn’t always a huge deal until recently. I have been seeing the same woman for 2 years now, on and off. She lives in another country for school and has been my biggest support. She had helped me through so much. I recently lashed out and ghosted her due to the shame of it all, without an explanation and she hasn’t tried to speak to me since and I’m afraid to say anything to her now because I know I’m not in any better of a place yet.

Talking to someone about ur voices can really help. Especially if they shut your idea about voices down in a nice way that helps you grow. 

Getting comfortable with a few certain voices can be bad, cos it can get you into loops.

Also don’t be scared? What’s the worst u gonna hear? RARRR I WANNA STAB U…. Or I’m watching u… or just like fuckin pure hateful shit… just grow some balls and move on.

Tell those shitty voices to fuck off and grow up, and they sound dumb cos we got lots of people that hear this shit and you all sound like fools for not understanding us.

You have to believe that you can change the responses of the voices.

I’ve done it… it helps…. 

Imagine some dude saying he fuckin hates you in telepathy just because you brush your teeth. 

All u gotta do is talk it out. You can do it instantly if you just believe in being nicer to things.

120,How do you cope with the guilt and shame at the things you did while psychotic?,"I’ve had schizophrenia (or another psychotic disorder—I’ve heard other labels like delusional disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and psychotic depression, but schizophrenia is the most common) for many years. I’ve done a ton of insane bullshit. I’ve stabbed myself, I threatened my friend with a knife, I’ve screamed at a bunch of random people in the streets, I told everyone Queen Elizabeth II had hunted me for sport at her private hunting lodge, I told people I was raised in a Satanic cult and forced to have children to be sacrificed, I’ve been taken to the hospital by police and been homeless and been committed many, many times. But there’s one thing I’ve done that’s so unfathomably shitty I find it hard to cope with. I think about the guilt I feel every single day.

I’ve had this ongoing delusion for many years about being from a specific country that experienced a lot of political turmoil, and of having been imprisoned and tortured there, witnessed hundreds of deaths, my children slaughtered, daily rape, forced to cannibalize others, incredible horrors. None of it was true, but I believed it very strongly for many years. It happened during my first psychotic episode, but when I got better I recognized it wasn’t true. In around 2020 I began to experience psychotic symptoms again, and began to believe it again.

Unfortunately, things didn’t go amazingly this time because my psychiatrist at the time, for whatever reason, believed my memories were true. She told me she believed that my psychotic symptoms were caused by PTSD, and that the likeliest explanation was that my memories were true. I wept in her office for literal months about the horrors I’d supposedly endured that quite literally never happened. I was sent to narrative exposure therapy, a kind of trauma therapy where you write the whole narrative of what happened to you, and that made things way worse. All the mental health professionals in my life at the time were telling me I needed to accept and acknowledge my memories to heal. This is insane to me. I didn’t speak the language, I didn’t have an accent, how did anyone believe it? It’s hard for me to even understand how I believed it. 

Now here’s where things get genuinely loathsome. During the couple of years that I believed this delusion, I began communicating online with other people from what I believed was my country. Some had been through, actually been through, similar things to what I remembered. Everyone was kind and gracious and welcoming. One person offered me money for therapy because of my PTSD. Eventually people realized that of course what had happened to me, my story, was insane and implausible, especially since I didn’t speak the language. I quit the internet for a few months when I was last in hospital, but I came back to a lot of hurt and confused messages. My new psychiatrist didn’t believe my memories and considered them a delusion, but I still believed them at the time. I deleted the social media accounts I used for any of this communication, and stayed offline for a bit at my therapist’s recommendation. 

I switched antipsychotics about two weeks ago, and finally last night/this morning I realized for the second time that what I remember, what I’ve been maintaining to my doctor and in therapy, cannot possibly be true. 

I feel so awful. I stole these people’s real experiences of violence for my own. I said nasty things about them under the belief that they’d done certain things to me. I’d give anything to take it back but I can’t. People were very hurt, and they have my real name and email so I occasionally get messages confronting me about lying about something so serious and personal. I truly never meant to lie—every word I spoke I entirely believed. I was haunted my memories of what I’d done and what had been done to me. It kept me up at night most nights. 

I’m so angry at myself. I’m angry at my doctors for encouraging me. I’m angry at my brain for giving me massive striatal dopamine released to continuously reinforce the truthfulness of what I thought I remembered. I’m so ashamed. I’m terrified of people finding out what I’ve done—I had tried for many years to hide from friends and coworkers about my schizophrenia. If my work or my school start being emailed, what do I even say? I hurt people so badly. I can’t stop vomiting, or shaking, or crying. I’ve felt this kind of remorse before every time that I came out if psychosis, but I genuinely think this is the worst thing I’ve ever done. Some of these people were friends to me because they believed we’d had a similar experience. I’m genuinely suicidal with the guilt of it. I wish so much that I could apologize and take it back, but how would I even explain? Why should they believe me that I was sick and didn’t mean to lie, when so much else that I’ve told them was untrue? I have schizophrenia and have had it for years, and it’s still barely comprehensible to me that I could believe that so genuinely for so many years despite the clear evidence to the contrary.",z15s10,4,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/z15s10/how_do_you_cope_with_the_guilt_and_shame_at_the/,schizophrenia

I value his agency and personal choices and will make no attempt to force him into anything or call anyone as long as he or anyone else isn’t in direct danger, and I know it’s harder for him than it is for me, but I guess the question is like how do you keep going. Like how do you just keep going knowing a bad episode could happen any second and he could attempt suicide again or might not even properly recognize me and think I’m trying to hurt him.

129,I want to consult something about schizophrenia and myself.,"Hello, I am writing this message with my love and honesty to you. I have never been to any psychologist or psychiatrist in my life. I was exposed to abuse and neglect as a child, I thought I did not suffer until now, but 2 years ago, I tried to commit suicide with drugs due to a problem I had. Since then he has never been out and I don't care to communicate with people, he is constantly grappling with my thoughts and my thoughts are destroying my feelings. I've been doing research on schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder for the past week. I have all the symptoms of schizotypal. I have all the experiences of schizophrenia except for 2 symptoms. I had many of these symptoms before I tried to commit suicide. 

One of these symptoms is trouble speaking to people, I've never had a problem talking to people or being in public. Secondly, I don't see hallucinations, but I have feelings like bubbles, tingling, scratching in my body that I can't understand. All my friends are constantly telling me that they do not understand anything that my actions and sentences are meaningless. I can't understand the behavior and things that people think of as normal, the things that need to be done seem extremely meaningless. I'm sorry I don't really know anything about the subject, I just want to consult. Is it possible for me to have schizophrenia without these two symptoms?

130,Difficulties before and after being admitted (venting),"I'm an English and Psychology Honours student in my university with a focus on creative writing. Due to complications with my various health plans, I was unable to afford my medication and thought, foolishly, that I could make it a month while it all got sorted out. Boy was I wrong. Due to the voices and disordered thinking, I effectively lost the ability to properly read and write, among other things and symptoms. It all culminated in my trying to take my life after losing so much of what I live for. I almost left my loved ones and kitten behind because I craved peace so badly and I resent myself for it, feeling guilty every day. It's been over a month now since I was allowed out, and I am still struggling. This term of university is a wash and I hate myself for it.

I'm trying to move on and focus on the future. I'm back on my meds, but I am feeling so discouraged. I've got people who say they believe in me, but I still cannot, and that self-loathing is creeping in and out of my days. I had to stop my mood stabilizer due to developing Steven Johnson's while in the hospital, and the new ones left me unable to function and I'm not on new ones yet. I still struggle around crowds, my moods are unstable and fragile, and I am unable to think straight. My writing still isn't up to par, and neither is my writing. I hate that I feel alone and isolated despite having good people around me, but I don't want to feel like I'm always complaining to them, so I just clam up and pretend I'm okay when I'm not. I'm waiting to see a counsellor and my nurse and psychiatrist again, but again, I just feel...alone and scared.

I don't know what to do even as I feel like an am told I am doing all the right things. I no longer have anyone in my life that really understands, so I just need to get this out.

131,In need of emotional support because I'm depressed and lonely about past erotomania which ruined my life,"8 years ago I had my first-break psychosis', and mental health episode at my High School when I was younger at the age of 17 after the two tragic deaths of my best friends that lead me into a prodromal phase. During my episode where it was me thinking I was Jesus Christ, and this other woman I was hallucinating was The Virgin Mary. I ended up getting arrested by a police officer and going to the hospital for wandering the hallways listening to my first auditory hallucinations from God telling me they were going to lead me to her. Now that I had come out with this information during my psychosis to my classmates; people had started to treat me differently.

These toxic ""Alpha females"", as they referred to themselves threw me under the bus when I tried talking to another girl. They told me she was a lesbian and was waiting till college to come out, and I should move on with my life. Ended up not being true after I believed it for 2 years.

I tried telling the first girl about this other girl being lesbian via DM, and she got a restraining order on me for contacting her after having the episode about her in High School. We followed each other on Instagram up until this point and weren't too unfamiliar with each other so I sort of got this wrong in my mind. For the life of me, I thought If I would and could've made a difference by messaging her to try and change things between us to get her to like me but it only made her hate me more.

I got arrested again after this restraining order was in place for the invasion of privacy for trying to suicidal ideate by talking to her on her campus through the address on the restraining order during another undiagnosed psychosis before I was diagnosed bipolar. That was in 2017, and it's still been 5 years since I've had a job because of my charges.

Long story short, I was years later diagnosed with schizoaffective-bipolar Type II in 2021 but this wasn't after having 2 restraining order's on me because I was ""a harm to her"". By ""harassing her"" whenever it was just my community that vilified me and made her the victim whenever I would be contacting her with my undiagnosed psychosis' of schizophrenia.

After my diagnosis' things luckily cooled off because I had told a third party that was mutual friends with the girl that had the restraining order on me that I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective, and after another year of the restraining order being in place she let it expire without getting another one or asking for a permanent restraining order. We opened a line of contact through each other, and this third party and started to talk about how she thought I was ""controlling, and visionless"" she also said that since time had passed by so much since we first had met that nothing was ever going to work out between us because we were entirely new people by the time we would talk again. She also said lastly...... ""I freed you for freedom's sake, there are always brighter days around the corner so never give up"".

8 months ago after all of this, I decided to delete my Instagram, and go no contact with the whole situation after realizing that I don't think she was coming back any time soon to unblock me, or would be giving me any type of second chance. It all break's my heart and I don't know what to do with my life because I have not had any contact with a female since my first episode in 2014. I don't know what I'm going to do with my life growing up because I have so much of a burden to explain to a woman, and I've never even gotten past first base since I've had my episode. Yet alone gotten to the point where I have to explain my history to a woman. Women are so intimidating to me, and I get scared when I'm around them because I always feel like that is in the back of my mind looming.

I don't know how I'm going to grow up and look into my daughter's eyes if I have one and tell her that I love her without thinking of the two restraining orders I've been through in my life. It's a terrible thought process to think about, and therapy doesn't fix anything other than seem like it makes me crazier that I would still be going to therapy for something like that if I was to grow up, and have a daughter. What frightens me the most is getting married to another woman because in one of my psychosis' I was very delusional, and bought a $600 Louis Vuitton ring and ""proposed"" to the girl that had a restraining order on me via social media. So now I have this ring, and will forever think about that moment whenever I have to propose to someone next. 

So now everything in my future for love seems to be ruined, and I don't even want to be with anyone really because I'm not happy with myself, or anyone. Has anyone else dealt with situations like this before, or know anything about it to help me get over this?

Also I would like to ask a question. This might sound silly but sometimes I think I say something(without moving my mouth or tongue) that comes from my unfiltered thoughts.

The Walk


I tried to make you proud
I tried to make you proud

Voices so loud that I’m a letdown
You wish I’d be more like you when I come around
But I’m trying to find a purpose
So it’s too bad my mind is 

Warped

My mind is warped

I’ve been trying to go forward
I’ve been trying to go forward through this life
And it’s so hard to relay 
What to say to you because we always fight

I want to win
Can I?

You never came to my shows
So I went home and took my medicine dose
You say you understood but
It’s like a fire spreading throughout these woods 
Like the darkness plagues and the soot
That’s left never goes away
It never goes away

So I walk through the fire
Like when you said I’m a liar

I’ve been trying to go forward
I’ve been trying to go forward through this life
And it’s so hard to relay

The paranoia and delusions make me feel so overwhelmingly suspicious and untrusting towards my loved ones and causes me to distance myself from them, want to lash out, accuse, and then next thing I know I’m in a psychosis. I literally cant be in anything like a ""relationship"" because it makes my paranoia so bad. I broke up with the girl I loved the most because I couldnt wrestle with the thoughts that she was using and cheating on me anymore. It feels so real to me. I hear things she never said. And I go through the motions as if these things are true. It hurts so bad. I’m so ashamed and uncomfortable in my own mind sometimes. I feel like I live in a blur. I feel like I’m very much here, but not at all. I do not know what is real anymore or what I’m imagining. These thoughts take over my entire mind. They burn my brain. It literally causes physical pain. I have hurt so many people, I’m ridden with so much guilt but at the same time I’m also traumatized by the thoughts and experience of it all as well. I don’t know what to do. I try to work on it, constantly. I try to trust others and feel confident but it never sticks. I always “relapse”. I have been doing everything I can the last few weeks to stay “sane” after hurting her. But I cannot stop ruminating about it all. Still bouncing back and forth between feeling hurt and confused and trying to decipher real from not and an hour later I’m crying about missing her and tempted to call and see if she would answer. I feel nothing but lost and hopeless. I exhaust myself. I was planning to visit her  family for the holidays in her home country and I backed out with no explanation and haven’t spoken to her since.

181,A loved one needing help,"Hey guys. Long text coming..
I'm very new to schizophrenia and don't know much about it, but I'm trying to educate myself now since my partner (or since a few days ago, ex partner) is showing symptoms. His case is pretty complex since we've only known each other since April and I only have HIS words to go on. But basically, the facts are: he has told me he has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder when younger. (18-19 years old, he's now 31.) He said they gave him antipsychotics for it as well, Zyprexa? That's the name in our country at least. (Sometimes the names are different.) The issue is.. He told me that they told him the diagnosis was wrong and that they took it back basically. And he said the doctor even apologized to him for misdiagnosing him and putting him on a medication he doesn't need. He is still a patient at a clinic for psychotic patients. But he stopped going there in August. He stopped taking his medication in 2016. I believed him all the way. Up until I realized he was showing signs of psychosis all of a sudden. Almost all the symptoms of schizophrenia...are present in his life. He doesn't know he's sick. In fact, he hates the word ""sick"", he even says he's NOT sick. Repeatedly sometimes. He meditates, goes for walks, takes vitamin supplements, takes photos and writes poems and diary entries as a way to cope with life. But.. He's alone a lot.

Okay. I'm gonna make the rest of this a little shorter. The reason I think the doctor is definitely correct.. He's told me about seeing fairies and one time he saw an angry looking little elf type ""person"" (super small) standing in the door way when he was in bed. He said ""when I didn't get scared and only stared back at him, he left"". He also sees auras around people and he tells me his hands get super warm when he's sad, ""like someone's holding my hand"". He also gets overwhelmed by lights and sounds and changes quite frequently. One time when in bed at someone else's house, he saw a red-haired (I think, or a woman with a red dress) woman coming down from the ceiling toward him. He believes in past lives and stuff and he thinks it was his mother from a past life. For many years, his mentor was a famous psychic. According to him, they were buddies and stuff. I'm inclined to reach out to him and ask him if he knows my partner, because I'm actually starting to realize...maybe he's confused about a lot of stuff? Maybe that didn't happen? Maybe he just read his books (which exist in his bookshelf) and got into some kind of fantasy out of it. Because he's told him a lot of interesting and weird things. Almost like this person is another part of him, like he's manifested him. I always go ""well I don't think you should listen to everything he says, you should trust facts sometimes too you know"" and he agrees, he tells me he doesn't believe everything he says.

But.. Besides all of this. What really made me worried.. Was when he described that he feels ""energies"" (spirits, ghosts or whatever you wanna call them) touching him all over when he's in bed at night. (Not every night.) They make him horny but without him wanting to get horny. He basically described it as some kind of rape. He said ""sometimes I can say no and they go away, but sometimes I'm too tired and just let it happen"". This makes me incredibly worried for him. But so far he hasn't mentioned any voices talking to him etc. And nothing has really been super negative yet, nothing that would make me call the ambulance or whatever. But the thing that got me convinced he's sick is I told him to ask the spirits to go away, to stand up for himself, tell them it's his home and he's the one in charge. (I'm spiritual too, so at first I believed him.) BUT then he said.. ""But not all of them are bad.. I want some of them to stay. With them, I'm never alone.""

I've researched but the only things I find are people hearing voices that are like super negative or whatever, but his thing is more..there to keep him company. He said that the nightly visitor is there less frequently now that he's met me and we are intimate etc. Are there people in here who can relate to any of this? I actually was honest with him yesterday. I mustered up the courage. He didn't hang up on me. Phew!!! He understood my concerns but assured me he's fine. He did promise me to get help ""if it gets worse"" though. He doesn't think he's sick at all but now he knows I do. I love him so much and I just want him safe.. What would you recommend me doing in this case? Or what would you appreciate as someone in his shoes?

Stay strong!! You're awesome.

I've also heard other symptoms involving memory.  She definitely has a hard time with her memory, but she also tends to have trouble focusing when I talk. I constantly have to repeat things or rewind tings for her and she usually just ends up scrolling through her phone. In addition to this her emotions seem to be very minimal. 
I'm just wondering if any of this is part of it, and how I can help. I myself have Borderline Personality Disorder and she's very good at not getting freaked out or stressed when I am. I've never felt more supported and loved. 
If these are symptoms of her's I believe I could just be supportive and accept it all and just do my best to not get annoyed and be accommodating for her. 

Basically just want to confirm if the attention issues, and or minimal emotional responses are a part of schizophrenia or not.

187,Should I just kill myself?,"I live in România. I am gay, schizophrenic on parapelidone, convulex and serlift, and after losing my mind five years ago on-board a cargo ship in Greece, my wages have gone from 1200 euros earned as an A.B. to a measly 360 euro minimum wage as a security guard. What's even worse is that technically I should be barred from work, and forced to live on 80.79 euros a month goverment pension, but I haven't told my doctor, and my psychiatrist has not yet told the family doctor about my diagnosis, since he is a private practitioner. Prices and inflation have skyrocketed, I struggle with internalized homophobia, I live with my parents, have no friends and have a toxic boyfriend who has only used me for my money, meagre as my means may be. Like that wasn't enough, I went from a skinny 80 kg 185cm twink to a 118kg ugly sad blob, so even my looks have gone. I also lost my average range smarts and I think I am more stupid now, since I can't seem to concentrate as well anymore.

Once my parents, în their 60s die, I will be alone and most likely lose the house since I can't pay the bills or taxes. I will more than likely be homeless and untreated and die alone on the streets. That is my greatest fear. So maybe I should get it over with and end it now while I still have some dignity left.

196,Does anyone else constantly daydream conversations?,"Honestly not sure if this is sz related or not, but I started doing it about 10 years ago when I first got sick. I’ve been symptom free the last year and a half but this has remained. So I’ll basically constantly be reenacting conversations in my head. If I’ve just recently had a real life conversation, it usually starts as a replay of that conversation with added elements. If I’ve been alone for a bit it’s typically imagined between myself and someone who I may or may not actually know. 

Sometimes I whisper the conversation but usually I mouth the words and do some small, attenuated gestures as if I were speaking. I believe it is pretty subtle, people have commented a few times but generally I think (?) it goes unnoticed. It’s not a major disruption in my life tho it has embarrassed me a couple of times. 

I’ve tried to stop but I just do it so subconsciously that I’m usually halfway through the conversation by the time I realize I’m moving my hands or mouth. If I’m not actually speaking with somebody, or focusing on a specific task, I’m usually doing this daydream thing.

I have been thinking of maybe getting a personal trainer. It’s been bothering me to the point of not really wanting to be in public much because I feel bad about how I look. Also I have weight gain in my face like a very noticeable amount. My family comments on it. Is that a side effect of antipsychotics? 
Any advice is helpful. Thanks",yzl6el,3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yzl6el/resperidone/,schizophrenia

231,Introduction.,"I posted here two times already, but I think I'll stay here now, thus the introduction. (Which is also a little bit of venting)

There's not much to me, though. Since very early childhood it was assumed that I may turn psychotic due to: 1. Me not fitting the normal image of a child. 2. Clearly hallucinating and having trouble speaking. (I am Autistic, too. I don't necessarily remember what my parents told me about the doctors theories, and it's too late to ask, probably) I had a group of friends, one of them was sexually abused by her parents and died by hanging, which I saw the aftermath of with the age of 12, I became a shut in, parents never cared about me, but instead my bigger sister, who took care of me and probably kept/keeps me alive to this point. I was hospitalized a few times, mostly for catatonia and once in delusion of something I am not comfortable sharing. I willingly, with the help of my loving sister, left my house with the age of almost 17 again and went for a walk with her. Now I am 22 years old and participate in night school to make up my non-existent education since I was  12. I'm doing fine there.

I know for a fact that my sister checks this subreddit out so, if you read this, I love you M. Well that's it.

I used to be fascinated with schizophrenia until I became more focused on the why and how of the illness. It seems I forgot to think the way i used to. I was becoming the illness? 

Anyways, I started recording every possible moment I was not 'the illness'. I would make programs/causal models to return to who I was... that didn't work because I found out I don't have a good reputation. I was not respected for my personality and it isolated me. 

I went to war. I fought to know who I was and not who people say I am. I would write when I was inspired and later read the writing [some were journals and others pieces of manuscripts to provide stories for people to read] asking myself ""how did I write this? Who wrote this because I don't feel/resonate with the way I was when I wrote this?"". I wanted to monetize this because I had no chance with employment until I cleared student debt. That's when I saw the ""work"" of those around me. It was all those things they said about me telling me ""no, it's not you, it's weed talking"". I never hid my schizophrenia but it doesnt seem to be possible to some people. I took that ignorance and I put it into my writing to also bring awareness. 

The war that really uprooted my idea of myself was the one I faced in my own home. ""You're narcissist and you are incapable"" they said. In return I said ""what is narcissism? They are what they think/project onto me. Let me expose them"". I thought about all the people who say ""the media controls this and that"" and I tried to understand them. Found out those people who championed telling me who I am are the media, just without cameras and networks. 

What a mess, but at least I am building a relationship with my subconscious and 'the illness' is much more understandable to me. Anyone experienced weird trials because of schizophrenia? How'd you cope or reflect on it?",yz8767,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yz8767/i_wrote_to_remember_but_i_did_more_than_i_thought/,schizophrenia
248,"Hello members of R/schizophrenia, it is I.","My pseudonym is KemeticBlacklands. Nice to meet you. I'm new to this whole Reddit thing. Something I'm not new to is schizophrenia. I was diagnosed with very early onset schizophrenia when I was a wee lad/lass. It's been...tough, really, really tough. But I don't wanna make this sad so...time to introduce myself! 

I'm aesthete, from fashion to dance, to music and plays, I find beauty in all things and I absolutely adore all mediums of art, although my own art ability isn't fantastic. I'm bad at spelling, but I'm a linguaphile. I'm an Omnist , I love philosophy and theology, and one day I wish to become a Priest(ess)! I could write several paragraphs about what I love, but I'll try to refrain myself. I guess I should also mention I'm a philanthropist :D I love humanity! I love everybody! ...well, almost everybody. Okay.. I love a majority of people! 

I spend most of my days listening to music or ASMR, scrolling through Pinterest, thinking, reading and researching things extensively in the spur of the moment, making art, coming up with ideas or working on my 100+ creative projects, and thinking some more. I'm also an amateur game developer, if that accounts for anything.  

Okay back to things I love again :DD I love ancient Egypt, I love science, I love arachnids, I love taxidermy, I love spooky & cute things, I love cats...ooh, if you have a pet cat please tell me. I love potatoes and noodles. OK I'll stop.

I play Minecraft, Mortal Kombat, ROBLOX, Animal Jam, Fortnite, and FNaF. I'd love to play with somebody and talk about stuff :> I'm an asocial extrovert, but I'm a little shy. So sorry if I leave randomly. I'm also a little sporadic, and change topics really quickly. 

Uhhhhh. I don't know if I was supposed to type this much stuff. Oh yeah, the reason I came here was because 

1. I was using 7cups, was in a group chat, and I had met a man with substance-induced psychosis, and I don't know why I hadn't realized earlier that being around other people who've atleast experienced psychosis (although not true schizophrenia ig) made me feel understood for once. 
2. I had really bad intrusive thoughts and ideation (which I won't be saying). I won't be able to see a therapist for a while, nor do I want one (bad history with 'em), so I thought I could come here :)

250,Are you aware that you are psychotic while you are experiencing the psychotic episode?,"I ended up getting into an interesting [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/insaneparents/comments/yyq3gn/comment/iwwxhyz/) in another sub. I like to read about psychology and my understanding was that someone who is psychotic can never be aware of it during the psychosis. Whereas, someone with cognitive distortions and perceptual distortions can question whether the cognitive distortion is real or not, especially if something happens to question its validity as opposed to delusions where they fiercely believe that they are real no matter what. And someone with perceptual distortions knows that they are not real as opposed to hallucinations which feel 100% real.

This would mark the difference between s[chizotypal personality disorder](https://archive.org/details/DSM5Eng/page/n685/mode/2up) and [schizophrenia](https://archive.org/details/DSM5Eng/page/n135/mode/2up) (DSM-5).

i just present very strangely. i am very self aware, and when i am well i can distinguish between reality and delusion (it’s getting harder but i still do so relatively well). i don’t know i just feel like most here have had a different experience than me.

i was be treated for depression and anxiety before i showed any symptoms so when i did i got put on antipsychotics very early on, back in high school.

maybe im just invalidating myself. when i look back at what ive done, i know that neurotypical people don’t do the things ive done. ive tried opening my head with a cleaver because i thought bugs were in it, or starving myself because i thought food would put bugs in my body.

I see this most often in people with mild autism and adhd. Yes ik many of these are absolutely valid but the less valid ones are ALWAYS white people. Just take a quick look at r/fakedisordercringe. But schizophrenia is not even in the conversation at all and I know its the same people perpetuating stigmas about us. Neurodivergency will never be accepted and will always come with challenges societally until ALL forms of neurodivergency is accepted and schizophrenia is at the bottom of the fucking pecking order. 

Its just so frustrating because it feels like there isn't any room for us in the communities that WE should be leading. Sometimes I just want to tell people to shut the fuck up when they complain about bullshit like the struggles of being a gifted kid burnout or how they feel isolated for being mildly neurodivergent.

260,First post,I see a psychiatrist and therapist and they put me on antipsychotic meds about 2 months ago. I have been having symptoms for around 1 1/2 or a little longer. My first thing I noticed was I became very worried about the power outlets and that I felt like there was bad energy coming from them. I wouldn’t describe myself as religious but I tend to get very into religion when I start to feel this way. I think I’m trying to find an answer to these thoughts. Lately I have been having difficulty with feeling like people are going to capture me or hurt me in some way. I also feel like some sort of energy or spirit wants to mess with me and trick me. I hear noises and talking I don’t like to call it voices because that just makes me uncomfortable. Usually it is a lady who likes to laugh at me and trick me make me feel bad. I get random thoughts in my head to do things to “save me” like making a hole in my closet wall so I can escape. Or climbing an electrical tower to release the energy. I also feel as though somehow if I passed away it would be a sacrifice and that I would be helping other people wake up. That I wouldn’t actually die but I would be woken up again. It is difficult because being awake feels just like when I am dreaming. The psychiatrist won’t tell me my diagnosis he says we have to manage the symptoms first. But that makes me feel like nothing is wrong with me at all. I am aware this thinking is “off” but at the same time I believe all of it in my heart. I piece together different clues like numbers or billboards I feel like they are meant for me to interpret. I’m not sure what to do since it is hard to talk about. Has anyone else had similar feelings? I’ve thought about possibly an impatient stay but I don’t feel suicidal at all I just feel confused. I’m not sure if I would benefit from that.

About six years ago my family was hit with multiple deaths in a one year period.  The last one being my nephew.  His death hit the family so hard that everyone dealt with struggles in different ways, some still to do this day.  My son started sharing troubling memories from the past that never happened. He was convinced that ""the gangs"" would never let him have a job or live successfully.  He struggled with that off and on; admitted into the hospital so many times, I've lost count. 

He was initially diagnosed with something like depression with psychotic features.  The doctors put him on medications; one for depression and the other to address the psychotic piece.  Eventually he graduated to not only having these horrific memories of horrible things happening to him he also started hearing voices. 

This experience has been a roller coaster watching him go through this with no education on this illness, no literature. I have tried to read up on it to get a better understanding but this has not been easy.  The doctors' have shared their knowledge as much as they can but I still feel loss because known of the options we've tried have provided stable solutions.

I think we're left with having to take over his care which means having him declared incompetent or something along that nature.  We wanted this to be the very last resort hoping that something would click for him.  

The biggest issue is that he is an adult and can deny help which he has but we can see that he's in the throes of an episode but are helpless to help.

Can anyone offer any suggestions? 

Thoughfully,

Hopeful Mom",yyp54u,9,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yyp54u/help_for_my_son/,schizophrenia

i timed myself. it took 3 hours for the news to settle in my brain. 3 hours for me to feel sad, to realize what i've lost, and now its been 6 days and im finally very sad. but i feel like im too late to be sad. disorganization is bringing on more than just sadness and i cant identify a lot of it. im just stuck, feeling.",yywnli,3,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yywnli/my_last_grandmother_died_and_i_feel_like_im_not/,schizophrenia

271,My husband died while I was in the hospital,"My sweet Todd overdosed on heroin while I was in the hospital.  I was hallucinating and having suicidal thoughts; Todd drove me to the hospital.  I spoke to him on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday morning.  The rest of the time he didn't pick up the phone.  His sister Kelly contracted the hospital and left her number.  She said Todd wasn't answering the phone from her or his Mom. She said she was calling the police to check on Todd. The next day, Kelly and Todd's mom, Phylliss, visited me in the hospital.  They told me Todd had a heart attack and my friend and lover (Todd) was found with a plate of white powder divided into lines, which was likely heroin.  The grief was immediate, sharp, and crushing.  I felt as if someone snatched the breath from my lungs. 

The funeral is Sunday. Just a few friends and family.  I can't help but feel if I never went to the hospital, he would still be alive today.

273,Some coping mechanisms I use,"The barometer:  we gage pressure from those around us to tell how we are doing.

Drink from the cup:  sometimes life is like a bitter cup of tea, if its hot drink if its cold reheat or pour another cup

drifting off: When I have trouble sleeping, go into drift mode..like the sound going down slowly I let is all drift away.

Spot the tiger:  see that you have to control you inner anger

the thousand year night:  on long nights imagine you have a 1,000 years sleep

silent mode..if you are quiet you dont respond to those who try to belittle or harass

bend the bamboo:  you push your self to the pont that is still comfortable not too easy..like if you can max a 100 push ups do 50...

raise iron horse- picking your self up ..and getting the car started on a winter day

shelter emotions-  find a spot to focus on..in your life that insulates your emotions from being vulnerable to the outside world

pact to sleep- monitor your sleep if you dont get at least 6 hours call in sick and sleep all day

red zone- know when you are in a precarious position with your mental health

eye of the beholder:  what ever you focus on becomes the new delusion..

bend like the grass:  sometime people with schhizophrneia are hypersensitve, as they spew out their rhetoric.and it feels directed at you..imagin the wind blowing the grass it bends but it doesnt break.",yyjn8o,10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yyjn8o/some_coping_mechanisms_i_use/,schizophrenia
274,Abilify Akathisia and Acne.

I have extreme anxiety in crowded spaces to the point that if I dont take clonazepam I cannot leave the house, A lot of times it feels like people can hear my thoughts (like I say them out loud without actually saying them) and I know it isn't real but it feels very real at that moment, sometimes when people have a conversation I feel like they are repeating stuff I'm saying without realizing I'm actually saying that stuff until they say it in the conversation, A lot of times when I want to have a conversation with someone I say something in my head but am not able to say it out loud no matter how hard I try when those things happen I just want to isolate myself and if I'm home I just lock myself in my room.

  
I have checked the symptoms for schizo, derealization and cptsd and each of them sounds like what I have but not 100%.  
schizo - I realize what ever is happening isn't real  
derealization - I don't feel like I'm outside my body/can't control it

284,It’s telepathy…,"I believe it’s telepathy.

Your own mind can affect it a lot.

I believe there are people wanting to be seen as demons or gods, and so they appear in visions.

And I believe there are people wanting to mess with your head, and it happens easily.

Countries are still at war, so why would reading minds be an easy process? They fuck with you as much as they can, just to hide.

I hate the people that call it delusions… sorry.

Its only delusions if you go down the road of listening to aliens, or god, or your own voice, or someone’s lies too much. That can be easy to get caught up in.

It’s so easy to pretend I’m god and fuck with someone….. so don’t be fooled.

It’s easy to think you’re always right as well. That’s where listening to your own voice accidentally, goes bad.

But I believe we need to carve out better answers in telepathy and try to answer people more clearly…. Like I kinda believe we could improve telepathy a bit. If people were aligned a bit more.

285,Born with schizophrenia,"I just watched this YouTube video  ""Schizophrenia is a mystery but...."".
I feel vindicated. It is a disease of the brain, and I will never recover. Despite support services saying otherwise. I have felt like (what I imagine) a paraplegic in a wheelchair does, being told 'if I only had enough faith in God I would walk'. 
The problem people seam to have is the mind / body problem. That they are a mind that floats about, and if you just think the right things you'll be cured !. Not true. Consciousness is an emergent property of an active brain.  Schizophrenia is a developmental disease of the brain that occurs in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Sooner or later, you make it home, and or to your destination if you have one, then it was all worth it, but during the trip it can be grueling, and you feel like quitting. The answer lies in you.

When I decided to go to college with schizophrenia, at the age of 24, I was told that I migiht not be serioius enough to finish, but I was able to take heart, because I was book smart, I did more than what the people who worked for Voc Ed, said I could do.  I didn't look back and although I dropped out half way< I was lucky because I had a enough credits completed in one semester that when i quit the second semester, I had two classes to my name and finshed, was able to count what would have been a loss as a gain, when you make a leap of faith, some times the tide turns and you get what you need but if you stop swimming you will never get to land.",yxztvx,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yxztvx/i_dont_pray_for_an_easy_life_i_pray_to_be_a/,schizophrenia

It’s the only med among 10 that seemed to work somewhat so psychiatrist didn’t want to lower dose. Gave me Akineton but that just made me drowsy. I lowered it myself to 5mg after 3 months and the restlessness lessened a little bit. 
I recently met another psychiatrist and he took me off Abilify right away. I was on it for about 7 months. 

However, the akathisia is still there along with the eye movements. It’s driving me crazy.

My child arrived just the other day  
He came to the world in the usual way  
But there were planes to catch and there were bills to pay  
He learned to walk while I was away  


And he was talking 'fore I knew it and as he grew  
He'd say, ""I'm gonna be like you, dad  
You know, I'm gonna be like you""  


And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man in the moon  
""When you coming home, dad?"" ""I don't know when  
We'll get together then, son, you know we'll have a good time then""  


When my son turned ten just the other day  
Said, ""Thanks for the ball, dad, come on and let's play  
Can you teach me to throw?"" I said, ""Not today  
I got a lot to do"" he said, ""That's okay""  


And he walked away but his smile never dimmed  
Said, ""I'm gonna be like him, yeah  
You know, I'm gonna be like him""  


And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man in the moon  
""When you coming home, dad?"" ""I don't know when  
We'll get together then, son, you know we'll have a good time then""  


Well, he came from college just the other day  
So much like a man I just had to say  
""Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?""  
He shook his head and he said with a smile  


""What I'd really like, dad, is to borrow the car keys  
See you later  
Can I have them please?""  


And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man in the moon  
""When you coming home, son?"" ""I don't know when  
But we'll get together then, dad, We're gonna have a good time then""  


Well, I've long since retired and my son's moved away  
Called him up just the other day  
I said, ""I'd like to see you if you don't mind""  
He said, ""I'd love to, dad, if I could find the time""  


""You see, my new job's a hassle and the kid's got the flu  
But it's sure nice talking to you, dad  
It's been sure nice talking to you""

So I smoked cannabis every lunch time for the next 3 years while going to school and was mega paranoid and developed what I assume is schizophrenia due to psychosis.


I would hear shit that wasn't there, I would see things that weren't there.

I would think everyone is out to get me, and that everyone knew I was high. I was scared of public areas cause I thought everyone was watching me. I had this grand thought that I was the hottest shit best looking dude around, like model tier.

Cars made me paranoid as fuck and still do today, Even if they're empty, I assume someone is in there and watching me and for the worst judging. I feel like everyone is watching me, and judging me all the time...

Well, yeah, it’s like that, but people who have abused or assaulted me. 

They just live up here, telling me to kill myself, to cut myself, that I’m fat, worthless, a terrible person, a wh*re, that I’m faking, that I just want attention, that they put cameras up in my house and that they watch me change and share the videos with people and on the internet (I know it makes no fucking sense, but this one gets me a lot), and sometimes they hit me and assault me or threaten to assault me. 

Sometimes I can ignore it because I know it’s not real, and sometimes I get so enraptured in it all that I’m slamming doors, arming myself, locking and double-locking doors, checking peepholes, throwing things trying to hit them in the face, cursing them, the worst is when all this starts up when I’m trying to drive.

It can all get so dangerous and I have lost jobs because of customer complaints because I was caught havin a breakdown or arguing/talking to myself. No medication has ever made it better and I’m about to lose my disability. I keep trying to kill myself but it never works. I am just so tired. In every fiber of my being I am fucking tired. I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt in August and everyone is so fucking mad at me. They think I’m just not even trying to get better. I’m just so fucking tired.

I’m never comfortable or safe. Imagine living with anyone who’s ever abused you, anyone who’s ever raped you, anyone who’s ever beaten you, and they get me stuck in these false realities. Like they’re taking me away to wonderland. I can lose hours of time sometimes. I really liken it to dementia sometimes.

I’m very poor so I don’t go to a good hospital. All they have me diagnosed with right now is psychosis. (Every now and then I get convinced that I did terrible things or that I’m the antichrist, yes, literally). And it’s fuckng terrifying but all they do is throw pills at me. Sometimes when it’s really bad and I’m pacing and slamming stuff and they’re threatening to beat my ass or rape me, I just take my night meds and pass out. But that’s obviously not sustainable.

I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2020 while on my way to the state hospital of Wyoming. I don’t even know how accurate the diagnosis is, to be completely honest with you. One of the doctors at mill wood in august gave me bipolar schizoeffective, since the voices and my behaviors get worse when I get manic and start losing sleep.

I know y’all can’t diagnose me, and that’s not what I’m asking for. I just needed a place to rant, I suppose. I just need to find a way to cease to exist without people missing me or fucking anybody over. I’m a burden who just ruins lives. I’m fucking useless and broken.

TLDR; the voices are winning and they tell me that everyone in my life hates me and that everyone has always hated me for my entire life. I think they’re right.",yxb2k3,13,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yxb2k3/the_people_in_my_head_tell_me_that_im_faking_my/,schizophrenia

I used to be on risperidone but it fucked with my heart, which is a no no when you are a gym rat. Now im on afibily and i finally lost 5 kg from the 40 kg i gained from being on risperidone and that feels extremely great.

The thing is my psychiatrist doesnt want to go higher on meds (im taking 17,5, max dosis is 30) and she thinks it gets worse because of my period, so she wants me back on the progesterone only pill or switching medicine again. Im very terrified of switching meds again because the last switch wasnt easy but im also very terrified of gaining more weight... 

I'm currently 130 kg so i would prefer if i can continue to lower my weight even more without falling back into the good old starving myself way. My body doesnt fit my mind so i neeeeed to lose 18 more kg to get top surgery.

357,Dealing with the hallucinations,"* I am undiagnosed, I am not saying I may have it but I do have the hallucinations that are common symptom. 

TLDR at end. 

I do have a diagnosis of 

Anxiety, ptsd 

Undiagnosed ADHD and autism dissociative identity disorder 


I have spoken to my therapist with my concern of having schizophrenia and they don't think I have it.
Instead they think I have extreme chronic anxiety with paranoid personality disorder.

I have extremely bad auditory hallucinations where I hear people (people I know) say things or do things. 

They are always very aggressive, violent or sexual things. 

However I've also heard simple things like I thought someone said they hated me and want me gone, and I ask everyone and they said they didn't say that. 

At night time I haven't been able to sleep because these get so bad that it sounds like people I know, family and friends are doing sexual activities or harming eachother... I run out to stop them and they look at me like ""what?"" 
I've never once been able to run out when I am hearing stuff and actually back it up with stuff happening... I have had panic attacks thinking that they are fighting when they are not. 

My partner believes that due to my anxiety and growing up in a highly toxic / abusive relationship with my parents where they would often fight that my brain is going into survival mode and trying to make sure that the ppl I live with Nd care about don't do that. 

My partner is struggling with trying to help me through these because he wakes up very early and is often already asleep. 

I have tried using low doses of CBD and THC to fall asleep. 
I have tried music and other audio to blur it out 
I've tried melatonin 

Nothing is working. 

Ok so i do have noise cancelling headphones and ""loop quiet earbuds, memory foam"" which kinda help but not really because it's not strong enough lol so I can still hear snoring for example so brain goes what if sound I thought I heard is real. 

****Loop earbuds memory foam did help with sleep last night! 
I recommend them. 
We turned on our piano and violin music and put the earbuds in and it drowned out any noises that are coming from outside the bedroom so I was unable to hyperfixate on it at much! 


TLDR 
How do you help lower the hallucinations or allow yourself to realize that it's just that and nothing is happening? 
How do others help you with it?

358,The pants story.(And other moments from my life living with Schizophrenia),"Hi. I'm a 22 y/o Nonbinary person. I have always known I had schizophrenia even as a child but wasn't finally properly diagnosed with it until this year and am finally on the proper meds for the first time in my life because doctors finally listened to me and didn't just say ""No you have Bipolar disorder actually"" while I described my hallucinations and paranoia to them. For context and to be more specific I have Paranoid Schizophrenia. It came in the form of thinking people/the government were spying on everything I was doing on my devices, vivid auditory and visual hallucinations, and sometimes tactile(Feeling worms squirming underneath my skin). So there are three memorable moments from when I was unmedicated(Don't worry one is the pants story). The first is when I was sitting in my quiet room, no music playing, no Tv on, but I heard a mans voice in my ear like I was wearing earbuds and could hear him in crystal clarity talking about how he's driving home to the city through the countryside and on the phone with his mom, He said that he loved her and he'd be home soon. For context I live in a large city, it was so clear though that it wasn't like I was overhearing him per say like through a phone, it was like I was in the car with him

&#x200B;

The second is two being I hallucinated on separate occasions. One was a masculine figure that would stand over my bed(This was not sleep paralysis, this would happen when I first laid down, and I never sleep on my back, usually on my belly or my side.)But I would see this figure staring at me and I could just make out his features from the dark, he had charred looking skin and no lips or eyes, but it was like I still knew he was looking at me. I guess facing me is a better word. And he would do that alot so I started wearing a sleeping eye mask. The other most notable hallucination was one night I went to the kitchen to get water, there is a bedroom connected to the kitchen and I leaned against the sink and was just looking into it idly, and for a split second I see this tall completely white figure flash like in and out of reality for a few moments. It was floating a few inches off the ground and had weird limbs, and its head was like a crescent moon that had exploded for lack of better words. And then boom it was gone. 

&#x200B;

So finally the pants story. Before I went to seek medical help and to get diagnosed by a doctor who listened I had the biggest panic attack of my life fueled by thinking I was being monitored(as well as past trauma being uncovered) and became so paranoid that I would literally vomit and feel like I was loosing all bodily function control. Along with shaking 24/7 and my heart felt like it was going to give out. I was a wreck and the hallucinations weren't helping. But one day I decided to do laundry because I felt useless if I didn't do at least one chore. I had this pair of pants I loved(I still do they're nice comfortable jeans) So I pack a laundry basket making extra sure to put the pants on top so they get washed. Go downstairs to the laundry room and throw the clothes in and when I go to dry them...The pants aren't there. I become frustrated but whatever. Next load when gathering clothes I find the pants upstairs where I left them before, could have sworn I took them but okay this time I'm for real going to put the pants in the wash. Bring them down and throw them in. Time to dry. No sight of the pants. I'm getting pissed at this point and it's not registering that I was somehow hallucinating a different pair of pants as the pants I wanted to wash. So like I was washing a pair of sweats or something but I was seeing them as my jeans. But at the time I hadn't realized this. And no joke I thought an entity was fucking with me. I fully believed one of the beings I hallucinated in the past was pissed at me and was punishing me for some reason in the form of taking my pants. So immediately I call my mom at work and later on she said I was literally shouting and started flat out screaming about my pants being taken and I didn't realize and assumed I was talking normally. Sorry mom.  But the pants situation is what made me seek help and while kinda grim I can now kind of laugh at the visual absurdity of me literally screaming and pacing around over a pair of jeans.

&#x200B;

TLDR: A massive breakdown over a pair of jeans fueled by my paranoia and hallucinations made me seek help and take initiative to advocate for myself to get meds for my Paranoid Schizophrenia which I've struggled with since I was a young child.

360,guys I'm confused and could use some help,"So I've had a diagnosis of schizophrenia for over a year now but the past few months I've been doubting it more and more. I 100% experienced psychosis in the past though.

My issue I'm having is, I kept seeing these what I'd call ""bugs"" that would appear, move a few inches quickly and disappear. 

Only today have I googled it and found out that it's more likely floaters I'm seeing because I can never look directly at them and it's not actually a clear image of a bug. 

My antipsychotic has never helped me get rid of them even though I've been experiencing it for less than a year, where as my delusions have gone almost entirely whilst on medication.

I'm thinking this means I'm not schizophrenic and more likely had psychosis a few times and am now stable. The reason I think this is because my most prominent symptom was delusions. I've had tactile hallucinations and rarely olfactory.

The thing that puts me off this though is that when I see the bugs/floaters I get itch points and start thinking it's something crawling on me and need to scratch it or brush it off.

Should I talk to the people at my depot clinic about it (the wait for a psychiatrist is long and I don't have a named nurse/psychologist/peer support worker)
Or should I talk to an optician or do I leave it entirely.

364,What the hell did i experience today,"I have never been diagnosed with any of mental issues, even i have been told by the doctors that i have a very good knowledge of psychology and things like that but today i was freaked out.

Today i was on my walk back home from school, as always i went trough a forest like road becouse i don't like the cars driving and all the chaos on main street. I usually have a good time enjoying the nature all by myself, but today it was a goddamn horror.

Today was a foggy day, and i ended my lessons at about 4PM(in europe its the start of evening) and it was dark. I tought to myself, that i would casually take a piss somewhere away from the road. I stopped and looked behind me, and i started walking towards the place where i would piss, i don't usually piss outside, its quite silly actually, but when i walked like 4 feet, i stopped for no reason and looked on my left, i saw a some kind of creature that was leaning out of the forest, looking down on ground and all i saw was its kinda like dark, long, wet hair. I turned back and started walking fast towards my home. Then i slowed down, and my vision was starting to blur, like motion blur in videogames. I started seeing weird lines of light instead of points of light, and everything was like smudged. Then i started seeing something like creatures sitting on the tree branches all over the forest. I started running then. When i escaped forest, i returned to main road but things weren't easier there. I started seeing something like crows walking on the road and when i got closer, they dissapeared. Then something was walking in the grass and i started running again, i wouldn't escape my hallucinations tho, i started seeing glowing eyes in the forest about 500m away from my home. When i was about to enter the last corner before my home, there was a hay bale and a pine tree. The hay bale had grown its legs, like a centipede, eyes and it basically was a spider like creature, it was walking in place very fast. I turned my head away from that becouse i have arachnophobia, and then i looked at the pine tree, it wasn't looking like a tree from the first look, i was sure that it was a big person with a black hat and a long cassock, it was walking slowly to the right, i started walking casually, becouse i didn't want to scare that person, and then of course it was only a tree.

I know reddit is full of atheists, i accept that, but im a religious person, and i think you, redditors should accept that too. I had thoughts that im possessed becouse im very controversial about satan and the antichrist, i yell the phrase ""i hate the antichrist"" absolutly everywhere, and i think that the antichrist has finally declared a war with me.

I don't belive that it is a mental issue, like schizophrenia, i mean, my grandmother is suffering from schizophrenia and have been living with her for 15 years now, and it is possible for me to suffer from that too.

Also i don't take any meds for my mental state, apart from vitamins, and also i want to point out that yesterday i started drinking coffe and 0 beer for the first time in my life and i enjoy it. before the hallucinations i drank about 660ml of coffe and a bit of 0 beer so it might be a sign too.",yx7seq,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yx7seq/what_the_hell_did_i_experience_today/,schizophrenia

I have lot of thoughts racing but I can barely put it down on paper and I used to be the composed one of the group. It's a downward spiral at this point. I feel like I'm never going to make it. All I wanted in life was a steady desk job and to be left alone. 


I don't think I can ever get into college like this. Everything I read immediately slip from my mind as soon as I take my eyes of it. The derealization is constant and unbearable. Every day I wake up and it took five minutes to transition from my dreams where I feel like how I used to be before I developed schizophrenia into the bleak hellscape I now live in.

367,What do you wish your friends or loved ones would do to help?,"I recognize that everyone is different and and experiences vary, but I wanted to reach out to this community and ask folks what kinds of things you wish your friends or loved ones would do (or not do) in terms of offering support?  If anyone feels comfortable sharing, I will look at each response on an individual basis and not as a blanket statement that generalizes how everyone feels. 

For context, a close friend of mine has schizophrenia, with her most persistent and debilitating symptom being persecutory delusions.  I'm not always sure how to be the best support for her.  I guess my approach varies slightly depending on the severity of her symptoms, but I always listen when she shares her fears and try to show her that I actually hear what she's saying, not just disregard her concerns due to her diagnosis.  There have been friends in her life who she stopped sharing with because they, with good intention, outright told her that what she was experiencing wasn't happening and that she was just being paranoid.  I always want her to be able to come to me, but I'm trying to find that balance of validating her experiences without feeding into her delusions.

Right now I can tell she's at that tipping point of curbing her mounting paranoia by upping her medication or falling into full on psychosis.  The tricky thing is that she has never agreed with the diagnosis and only takes a very mild dose of her meds (.5 mg of I forget which antipsychotic).  She only takes it, with encouragement from her partner, because she recognizes that every time she stops she ends up in the hospital (psych ward.)

Anyway, I'm not here to ask how to get my friend to accept her diagnosis or to take the correct dosage of her medication; I'm here to see what support you would like to get from your friends.  I'm very concerned about her right now.  I want her to be able to see me as a safe space and I want to be careful not to inadvertently say or do anything to cause her to distrust me or think I'm part of ""the conspiracy"" but I also want to actually keep her safe.

370,I want to go off my meds and do drugs until I die,"Throwaway account so nobody sees this and starts worrying about me.

I'm a heavily medicated schizophrenic and I'm miserable.

My medication is so strong that I'm constantly tired. I'll often sleep 12 hours and can end up sleeping up to 20 hours if nothing wakes me up.

I lost the only jobs I've ever had because sometimes i wake up and literally can't move. 

I've changed meditations multiple times and these are the LEAST bad, which is fucking depressing. The idea that these are the best is so unspeakably disheartening but that's what all signs point to. 

I feel like a fucking zombie, I used to have so much energy, I used to think I was special, I used to feel alive, I was in agony, but I was alive.

I still hallucinate sometimes, and every time it happens I panic, not just because they can be scary, but because every time it happens I fear that I might need to raise my dosage.

I won't be able to cope with my meds getting stronger, they're already so strong, if my meds truly stop working and they have to Increase it I'll probably kill myself.

I know I shouldn't go off my meds, the person I am off my meds is a genuine danger to myself and others.

But I'm struggling to stay motivated in taking them, whats the point, why should I care about the danger when my alternative is this never ending dirge of constant exhaustion and sadness.

I'm a trafficking victim, I have severe ptsd from what I was subjected to, I feel utterly broken and don't think I'll ever be happy.

I don't feel human, I feel uncanny around normal people, I feel like my life was destroyed permanently and that society doesn't seem to give a shit.

I've also been recovering from drug addiction, I still take drugs every now and again, but I've been trying to avoid complete relapse. Which is something I'm also tired of

I hate that I have to spend my life putting in effort to avoid something that makes me feel amazing in a life where I feel so beaten down.

I know I shouldn't do it, I know it's a horrible idea, I know I could end up institutionalized, dead, or in prison. But the alternative feels just as desolate.

When I'm off my meds I end up with various delusions, and sometimes I still entertain the thoughts that I had before. 

There is an accompanying paranoia which is terrifying and painful, but within the delusions I get to feel important, I get to feel like I'm more than the worthless pathetic victim I am.

I want to stop fighting, I'm sick of being tired all the time, I'm sick of feeling worthless and powerless, I'm sick of the fear of relapse.

If my options are this lifeless existence or a life of chaos, I'm really not sure if I can keep choosing lifelessness.

I want to go off the deep end and see how far I can fall. I'm tired of fighting.",yw0d7d,159,96,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yw0d7d/i_want_to_go_off_my_meds_and_do_drugs_until_i_die/,schizophrenia

I use to wear headphones everywhere to block a song out. A funny example is ""Private Eyes"" by Hall and Oates. It was a lot of other music too. And anything by Nick Cave.

Sure, I'm suspecting if I have schizo or psychosis, but I'm also suspecting if I have DID/OSDD, but that's not the point right now! The point is that I know that this isn't like system-related stuff.

I just hear voices in my head telling me things. Mocking me and laughing at me, making me feel very bad. I just don't understand. Sometimes I hear my grandma playing her gambling game downstairs when she's not really even there downstairs. I haven't heard about that in like awhile or like years.

And as a kid, >!I dropped my pillow or my stuffed animal and I woke up to grab whatever dropped and I was in my grandparent's bedroom sleeping next to my grandma and like I remember when I set up I saw two dead girls in the mirror right?  They had blood covered on them, and one was holding a dead turkey or a dead chicken! I think it was the girl on the left. I don't know. I just know it was thanksgiving, and one was holding up a bloody knife too. They were both kids tho.!<

>!But when I have panic attacks it's like hell. I have so many thoughts in my head that aren't mine and they let me to self-harm, or do crazy, scary shit. I hate it. I wish it would stop. I just don't know. But when the panic is over. I don't remember the thoughts or what happened and I just sometimes feel normal, but sometimes I remember the thoughts and everything.

398,"A reality bending, brief hallucination, but impressive.","I went for a 30 minute walk today. It's snowing in Minnesota. I decided that one day I wanted to move to LA California to attempt a music Career. As I've been taking music seriously for 10 years. I had one good gig Down Town, but burned bridges because I didn't trust myself to drive home from clubs anymore with Oculogyric Crisis.

I got off the med causing the Oculogyric Crisis, but my career took a major hit as I lost contact with those booking agents / club promoters.

ANYWAY... as soon as I decided I wanted to some day try a music Career in LA California, for a moment my street turned into the streets of LA. Snow disappeared, sun was shining, I saw buildings I've never been to.

I wasn't afraid as it was a, brief hallucination.

Kinda like, huh that was wild...

I continued my walk around town and through the park. It was beautiful and i took pictures and posted them to Instagram. Some of my best photography.


Just wanted to share this story with the community. I'm working on getting my meds taken care of. As it's been hard since quitting haldol after stopping cold turkey a couple months ago. My psychiatrist approved, and prescribed me a PRN or as needed for extra Invega added to the Invega in the morning. I also went 3 weeks without any AP about 2 months ago and I haven't fully gotten back to ""normal"". As I never got that PRN from the pharmacy. I'm going back to see my Psychiatrist mid December.

My family relationships are terrible right now. My Mom Dad and Sister are arguing with me and yelling at me and i don't know what to do.

But I got dreams of taking my meds and going for the big time in LA one day before it's too late.

I'm 36 and currently living at home with my parents. But they yell at me a lot. Pretty sure my sister just blocked me over a texting argument that started with me saying I, feel left out of the Thanksgiving/ Holiday, plans everyone is making.

Edit: update! I decided to not follow my hallucinations. But I had a good idea. I'm focused on paying down debt and then moving to the City, away from my parents, but it's the city I was born in. Minneapolis, Minnesota. I'm currently in a suburb of the city. So staying here will be a goal I can actually accomplish realistically! Maybe I'll visit LA one day though. Play a gig there or something.

Edit 2: to clarify my last entry. Staying here means not traveling across the country alone to California. Not. I'm gonna live in Minneapolis alone and pursue my music career. I already live in Minnesota so I'm good there.

I have schizophrenia and some other disorders (ADHD and autism, PTSD, depression, anxiety) and I have such a hard time holding a job. It's too much for me. I can't handle the stress. I've never had a job for more than 8 months, I always either quit or get myself fired. I can't get anything better or low stress, because I didn't go to college and don't plan to (I suffered badly throughout my entire school career, and I don't want to put myself through debt and stress myself to death again at school, and not be able to live up to their expectations; I barely passed highschool, even with 504 accommodations).

Does anyone have suggestions or tips on how to hold a job? What do you do? I feel like I'm barely functioning as is. I'm unmedicated, and can't afford to be medicated, or to put myself through therapy- not that either of those even helped with this situation anyway. All I want to do is sleep all day, I barely want to get out of bed, and the only reason I do is for my boyfriend. He's physically disabled, so I have to take him to work, or where he needs to go. And then I just go home and go back to bed, because I'm too stressed out and scared of the world and my own mind that I can barely do anything else. 

We live with my parents, and my boyfriend can't make enough on his own to save to get out of here (he can only work a limited amount of hours) and I feel so USELESS. I need to contribute, and yet I can barely get myself out of bed most days, I'm so tired and miserable. I'm just constantly exhausted, and in pain, as I also suffer from chronic pain. None of the jobs I had have ever been willing to accommodate me for even my physical problems- not even a goddamn chair, because ""it looks bad to have an employee sitting"". I just don't know what to do anymore. They don't make sit down office jobs for people with only highschool diplomas, and the ones that do are either sketchy, or require lots of speaking on the phone (severe anxiety trigger).

I hope I don't sound like I'm just whining and complaining about nothing. That's not what I want to hear. I WANT this to change, and I want to do something, and I hate laying in bed all day, and I just want to function, I don't want to live life under the covers while I get berated and constantly reminded by the voices about how useless I am and worse. I feel like I'm just always letting everyone, including myself, down.

How often do you see things? Do you see things/hallucinate every single day?

I find this really hard to believe that a clinician would ever condone or promote smoking (this is not a moral/legal issue to me.

415,is my family using schizophrenia as an excuse or is it possible that theres nothing we can do with my grandmothers behavior? can we somehow help her?,"at the very beginning - im going thru a diagnosis right now, my doctor thinks it might be schizophrenia, so its possible that i know what its like. 

my grandmother is schizophrenic. shes supposedly on meds and taken care of but shes been harrassing everyone in her environment for years. her harrassment was so bad both her sisters cut her off 10 years ago, her husband lives on a different floor and doesnt talk to her and her neighboors called the authorities numerous times. 

the only people she has contact with now is her daughter - my godmother, and her son - my father. i openly told my father many times that i blame them for my grandmothers behavior. because they are actively encouraging it, my godmother by participating and my father by staying quiet. how do you let your wife and child get harrassed by your mother and sister? i recently found meds at our house, not mine or my moms, we guessed my father took them from my grandma. dont know the reason. he says her behavior is just 'love and care'. sure.

she recently got two birds to not feel lonely. im not going to disclose the details because its a little gruesome but shes abusing them. she had 3 birds before and all of them died out of nowhere. im pretty sure these two will share their fate. i told my father to go to her house and take these birds before she kills them, she refused to give them to us and he just ... left. these animals are still there. my father and godmother both know what shes doing to them. and they wont take them away.

i told my mom that i dont want to see my grandma. ever. i know this behavior might not be her fault, but ill never look at her the same. i believe theres something we can do. because i experience the same symptoms she does and i would never physically hurt an animal or another person. i have friends and family members with bipolar, psychosis etc. they would never hurt anyone. my godmother has so much in her bank account therapy or even a caregiver wouldnt be an issue. 

is there anything i can do? is it possible i might act like her one day? is there a reason why my dad and godmother dont want to help her?",yw0byy,3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yw0byy/is_my_family_using_schizophrenia_as_an_excuse_or/,schizophrenia

I'm torn because I am very comfortable and like my NP. I am also hesitant on genesight because I heard genesight has mixed reviews. If I decide on not doing genesight is there much benefit in transferring to that new provider if they are going to just rotate through drugs I haven't tried anyways?

I read the pinned post, and the part about you guys not actually being the violent type contrary to popular belief was a major debunking moment for me. I've been told by one of my parents that those with schizophrenia are detached from reality, but now I'm not sure if that's completely true.

428,I'm diagnosed with schizophrenia but I have doubts,"I began being diagnosed with Depression, then Bipolar Disorder and now Schizophrenia, according to two last psychiatrists in my country.

I'm 27, I meet all negative symptoms as lack of motivation and **hopelessness**.

I've never had hallucinations or delusions, never heard voices or thought bizarre beliefs about people in last two years I'm diagnosed.

I excelled at math, with my SAT equivalent, I could enroll to the best university in my country. I've taken two cognitive tests, in all domains I mark **conserved**, except lazy memory in which I marked slightly under average.

According to my psychiatrist I present disorganized speech, and the way I see this symptom is crucial for him. I agree, the little I talk I show latencies and forget words even things that happened yesterday. But I should say that I've been two years isolated without social contact, without doing anything; can't be this monotonous lifestyle what make me think this slow? I've never been fast-thinking, but at age 20-24 I learned things, words and concepts besides math. Last years I've experienced (perceived) cognitive impairement, which is a symptom of schizophrenia, but isn't my style of life what is producing it?

Psychiatrist insists I take the antipsychotic, but the way I am, his 20 minutes interview isn't enough to convince me. I'm not convinced. If I was I'd take the prescription, but I can't stop thinking, what about if I change my daily habits, the comfort zone I live in, maybe my brain will start functioning and with that my motivation, cognition and social/sexual drive will improve? IDK.

I spend my time 10 hours in bed, 13 seated and 1 standing. Always was amateur athlete and negative feelings brought me here. What if I begin sleeping at night instead of from 03:00 to 12:00? what if I go out and walk? take sunlight? shower in the morning? Can just the right habits make me start functioning? If someone tell me yes, I can start making these changes.

.. it's hard to face my Situation, the memories and lot's other bad things, becuase I'm traumatized on several levels, beit an illusion or the truth!

So I wont share, if possible, my troublesome story, my unbearable situation(s) and much more.

---

- First, it doesn't matter if You are from any country outside the EU. I'm asking about the general and international accredited aproach and not about my local laws You can not know. The more You answer, the better. ok?

---

- In short:

I'm male in the mid 30's, from a western european country and my ""symptoms"" started about 5 years ago in a time where I was about 2 years abstinent from drugs.

drug past, tried my best but absolutely not convinced of diagnosis, subjective assumptions are of non-supernatural cause, neither abstinence for 2-3 Years (when it begun) several times of a 3 week Antipsychotic schedule (each time a different one of the usual kind) or drugs like Ampethamine or Cocaine have NOT changed my percetption by an inch! Nada!

So, how to prove that I'm not schizophrenic when there is allways a joker card from the docs like treatment resistant schizophrenia.

I could do the whole program of minimum 4 Months of Antipsychotics but I'm affraid it wouldn't prove anything..

So what should I do?

I hope that You understand that having schizophrenia and that this all was just a bad dream, would be relief far from possibly describable.. but it's not.

----


More informations:

ok, I don't believe that I'm schizophrenic and I've allways believed that this is real and a defaming/conspiracy (on a personal level and not the CIA, Aliens or whatever supernarural cause) it's just that this story is to virtually anyone unbelievable because it's about 1000 or 2000 People against me and my Mother. 

""They"" are poisioning us  but You can see the ill-intend in their eyes and from what I've gathered is that it's usually the asocial, naive or lost ones. There wasn't ever one very good person among them but it spreads like a cancer over cities and borders, however relative slow.

 However I don't know the reason at all!! No way finding it out, no way that my whole life is just a line of destructions I've left nor me and my Mother had harmed anyone that we can be sued nor anyone repeatetly but we are so much hated over the past few years... there is and won't be an End!! ok?


It is Kafkaesque.. 

----

Anyway, yes I have a history of drugabuse but even Cocaine hadn't caused anything, well, for me noticeable in terms of paranoia or anything nor has the repeated use of Antipsychotics for each about 3 Weeks and one time nearly 5 weeks ANYTHING changed.

Nothing!! I'm even since 6 Weeks abstinent from all drugs, it's still the same situation without any silverline.

There were moments in the past years where I wanted to commit serious violence (!!!) Suicide was often times at my thoughts. As said it is and was sometimes unbearable!


Now, everything that is happening to me, when something is wrong, is easily put as ""part of my illness"" like the bloodwork is ok, therefore You are ok and bye.

So, damaged as I am allready I would take the risk of further damage through the Antipsychotics and it has to be at least 4 Months (please leave me in this believe.. long story, long)

However there is the problem of treatment resistent psychosis or schizophrenia.

I fear taking those meds would ultimately lead to nothing for me.

Because according to that logic, I'm either schizophrenic or I'm schizophrenic and there's no nothing to prove against that.

well at least for someone getting wellfare but also a blue collar job to pay that several thousand bucks for one chemical analysis each(!) That is what my Psychiatrist has said to me at least.

Do you mind if people talk about schizophrenia negatively or treat is as a serious mental disorder? Or do you prefer if people talked about schizophrenia in a different way?

469,"Bipolar and schizoaffective overlap, and memory loss","In a recent appointment, my psychiatrist said there’s a possibility of schizoaffective disorder. She explained to me the difference between that and bipolar, but I’m suffering from memory loss, so I forgot what she said. What is the overlap between the two conditions, and the differences. How has medication helped you cope with your symptoms ? I’m currently diagnosed with ADHD, Anxiety, Depression, OCD, PTSD, Bipolar, BPD, and I’m trying to get assessed for ASD. I feel like adding another diagnosis to the list will confuse me even more about where my symptoms are coming from.

I’m currently taking 9mg of Paliperidone, along with 2 other medications. I believe it may be contributing to my memory loss post psychosis. I’m going to mention it again to my psychiatrist, because last time I did, there was only silence. She really wants this medication to work, but my hallucinations are 70% gone, not 100%. I don’t think they’re helping my impulsive spending, monologuing, and racing thoughts at night. I don’t know if medication can help with these symptoms, and I’d like to know how your medication has helped you cope.

Also, my mom got mad at me for wanting to switch medications after just receiving a new prescription. I went about 3 days without Paliperidone, and my hallucinations increased. I told her that it’s not fully working, and I’m concerned about my memory loss. She says to wait until I finish the medication, then talk to the doctor about switching. I got a 3 month supply, and I have 2 months left. She says I can’t just switch after getting a new prescription, that’s not “how it works.” She also said she paid $35 for the prescription, and that it’s expensive. 

I feel weird that she said that, considering the fact that it’s so important that I be properly medicated, and that I was hospitalized three times for psychosis. I could just pay her back the $35, and I presume I’m old enough to pay for my own medication. I’m still under her insurance, and was always under the assumption that she WANTED to pay for my medication and to see me get well. This isn’t the first time she mentioned how expensive my medications are, and to me it just seems like another thing I’m “burdening” her with.

As a result, I try to be as quiet as humanly possible and am probably a great neighbor.  But I can’t get it out of my head that they can hear everything I do.  Even though I can’t hear them except for comment based hallucinations.  

In addition to schizoaffective, I have Tourette’s (no words, I forget what that’s called, but still, I make sounds).  This all feeds back into the delusion of sound being a prison of the mind.  I try to suppress my tics to the maximum but they still make small noises.  I’m not sure if anyone can actually hear me but it might sound kind of weird if someone could.  But I think mostly it’s in my head.  I just can’t stop obsessing over it though, my brain is stuck in a loop during the daytimes, day in and day out.

480,Can anyone help? tldr at the bottom.,"Hey, so I'm posting here because this is the only place I have access to at the moment where I feel like I can ask about it.

I've had mental health problems most of my life and have another genetic condition that predisposes me to developing schizophrenia, and about 9 years ago I was diagnosed with CPTSD.

My whole life I've had auditory hallucinations, mostly music, but over the past few years it's been voices and even more recently I can clearly make out what they're saying.
I've had visual hallucinations as well, where I've seen animals, things like spiders or bugs crawling on things, that obviously weren't there, and sometimes things like eyes looking at me.

I've had depression my whole life, and I thought maybe that would explain some of the other things, like the shutting down and not speaking to anyone, not feeling emotions, (when my girlfriend was pregnant earlier this year she kept saying she felt like I didn't actually care or was happy about it because of how I acted, same thing when we lost the baby she thought it didn't bother me.) And I've had sociopathic tendencies.

But, recently my genetic condition I mentioned has gotten worse and they've been putting me on all kinds of meds to try and get it under control.
A few weeks ago, they put me on nortriptyline, after a few of those I had an episode where my pain was worse and I couldn't stop crying and felt like I was being hunted.

Ever since then, I haven't felt okay in my own skin and have these episodes where I'm terrified of everything and again feel like I'm being hunted.
I read that nortriptyline can cause latent schizophrenia to become active, and I think that's what happened.

TL:DR

Between being predisposed to it, trauma, and meds that can cause it to become active, evidence supports the idea that I think I'm schizophrenic.

Can anyone tell me anything similar that's happened to them? I feel lost and alone in trying to deal with this and would appreciate any help anyone might be able to offer",yupydk,1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yupydk/can_anyone_help_tldr_at_the_bottom/,schizophrenia

My husband calmed me down after it happened, and today, he told me that I should tell my psychiatrist about this. I'm sure the knock wasn't real since the dogs would have rushed over and started barking at the door, but the car was probably real since I have neighbors. I'm not sure if it's the new antidepressant I'm on (Pristiq), if I'm developing schizophrenia, Idk.

I've been diagnosed with severe depression, generalized anxiety, and health anxiety (which makes me all the more afraid of developing schizophrenia). I'm additionally on Zyprexa for both depression and anxiety, if that information helps.

Maybe I was so afraid of developing it that I willed the hallucination and delusion into existence on count of my health anxiety, or is that another delusion? Maybe it's anxiety?

(So what's next is pretty much pointless, it's really only if you'd like to know what's happening to me, even though it's complicated to explain since I'm not a native in english)  


It's been a few years since I discovered I was not alone in my head, at first I called him ( It doesn't have a gender and it can change its form any time in my head, but I'll call it like if it was a man) ""Brain"" so that I could talk about him without anyone knowing it was another entity, then I've been able to say it to my parents last year, I've got help, psychologist, support from my parents, etc... 

I stopped seeing a psychologist this summer. I found ""Brain"" a name, Xara, he didn't seem to be bothered by it so I kept the name. (Note that he doesn't talk, neither is he something I can see, he's only in my head, we can discuss in a weird way though. ( I talk, he reacts with any form of things he wants me to see to be able to understand what he wants to say))  


Xara can control my body sometimes, (it's like if I was spectating a scene when he does that) he can do that when I'm weak emotionally, he made me chase a kid from my school with the intention to strangle him (that was in January), my psychologist told it was a normal act since this kid bullied me with his friends. ""That was his intention"" that's what I was afraid to say. But what he's really strong about is making me think I think something when it's his thought ( I love that sentence, so confusing in a way xD )

&#x200B;

His constant presence annoyed me at one point, that's when I stared to use a pencil to hurt myself, it was like if I did it with a knife, except there wasn't blood and it didn't leave scars. I'm soon to be a year free from that btw, pretty happy about that, though mutilation and suicide thoughts keep growing stronger and stronger.  


Now here's what really makes me think I'm schizophrenic. I see shadows ""flying by"" like if it was going to a place to hide, it often takes the shape of animals but it happens to be a human sometimes. I also hear like if someone was calling me by my name, it's at the point where I don't even want to believe someone is calling me.

513,Tip for socializing more,"I have been feeling cut off lately with hardly any friends living near by me since I've moved in 2020 across country. I started using Bumble's friend feature to find new friends in my area, but very little people were using that new feature at that time. I decided to give it a try again these past couple of weeks, and there's way more people on there! Mostly women looking for new friendships like myself.

So far I've connected with like over 5 females (I'm female too) in just a few weeks who live near by me, and met up with one person so far! This has been way easier than dating, and exactly what I need for a social outlet. 

I attend online support groups too, but it's not the same as getting to meet up with someone and doing activities together.

Paranoid as heck, but I went out in public twice today and I usually don’t go out at all so I expected some feelings but definitely not this. Caffeine doesn’t make it go away and I drank my limit/usual amount. I usually don’t take my meds (night ones) until 10-11 so I’m not sure what this is.

523,"Should I be concerned? If yes, how do I seek help?","I've had hallucinations on and off for a while, but they have recently (the last 6 months or so), become more frequent and last longer.  
Before that I would have hallucinations (auditory, visual and tactile) that only lasted a second or less at most. They confused me, but I quickly realized that what I saw, heard or felt, wasn't real.  
In the last year, the previous small hallucinations got more malicious. I see tall shadow figures stalk and chase me in broad daylight, and I hear screaming and gunshots at night (I live in a country with strict gun laws in a high end neighborhood so if these hallucinations were real, they would be all over the news).Over the last 6 months, these hallucinations have gone from only happening once or twice every 2 months, to a couple times a week or day, they have also increased in duration.

Previously, I knew that the things I was seeing wasn't real, but now I have to fact check if my area really did have extreme lightning strikes 4 days in a row, or if there really was a violent fight with gunshots that lasted 15min in the park beside my home.

Should I be concerned? Is it somewhat normal or can it be tied to anxiety or sensory issues?  
If I should be concerned, how do I find the help I need? Most psychologists in my area say they only work with anxiety or stress when it comes to adults. Do I search for a specialist instead or is the standard psychologist equipped to help with hallucinations as well, even if they say they only work with patients who have anxiety?

Edit: Ik, that my hallucinations aren't tied to stress, as there isn't a correlation between my moments of stress and amount of hallucinations.  
I also know that schizophrenia runs in my family. My aunt on my mothers side got diagnosed with it and ended up taking her life due to a delusion before I was born.

I will literally see people turn to each other and make these expressions like they have this inside joke or sinister plan. If it gets really bad I'll actually hallucinate them saying things with their facial expressions matching. I have confronted many people many times about it and all the time they tell me they weren't even looking up or saying anything. This is only part of my hallucinations and delusions but it prevents me from comfortably going out in public or interacting with anyone.

&#x200B;

My main delusion is that I think everyone in my life and even strangers are part of this plan to hurt or even end my life. They only participate in my life because they enjoy the thrill of the game of trying to manipulate me. This and along with the hallucinations cause me to get extremely paranoid and look through old text messages to see if they slipped up somewhere. I track when they're online and see if there are any patterns with each other using the online status and last active \_\_\_ . If I happen to see any patterns that support my theory, I usually send out ominous messages implying that I know. 

&#x200B;

I had a flat tire a couple months out, probably from a pot hole, but a part of me thinks someone slashed my tire. I currently have a tire that might have some damage to it because it's leaking air very slowly and I suspect someone else did this.

531,Stories for professionals who failed us,"Hello, this post will be describing my personal experience with a medical professional and how they failed me when I needed help the most. Though this post may be negative, in the end I did see a better psychiatrist who helped me get better. 

So a few months ago I was struggling with anosognosia, which is a lack of insight into one's illness. I thought I was perfectly healthy and that I only had a psychotic episode out of stress and it wouldn't happen again. I thought it was simply a ""one time thing"".  So, I wanted to get off medications. So, I set up an appointment with my psychiatrist. Because I firmly believed that I didn't need medications because I was doing fine (even though I wasn't).

So, I set my appointment for September 13 with my psychiatrist. Now by then, I was questioning whether my idea was a good plan. This was due to my therapist being firmly against the idea of me being off my medication. I still didn't believe her advice due to me being rooted in doubt. But, I just felt something was wrong. I should've listened to my gut, now that I think about it. But, I didn't. 

The appointment was over the phone and only lasted 15 minutes. But, those 15 minutes scarred me. I only wanted to be off medications and suddenly I was asked about my symptoms. So, I listed them out. There weren't many symptoms going on (or at least I thought) and the psychiatrist said I was just experiencing ""illusions"". And they then changed my diagnosis to schizoid personality disorder. Because I didn't fit the criteria. 

(I was highly paranoid at this time and believed my phone was tapped into, and someone was listening into the conversation. So, my thought was to play ""normal"")

I was left confused and lost on what to do. But, I just tried my best to push onward. I thought he knew better than me. So, I got off my medication because he canceled the prescription.

Worst mistake of my life. 

My symptoms crawled up quickly. First, the negative symptoms got worse. I couldn't get out of bed or take care of my hygiene. I thought I was a fraud. That I was faking every symptom of this illness. Then the positive hallucinations kicked in. I felt maggots on my skin and flies on my hair, I was seeing shadow people. I thought my food and water were posioned for a short period. I believed someone was out to get me and I didn't want to leave the house. For three whole weeks I was in psychosis. It was awful. 

Once, it was over (it didn't last too long due to me seeing a new psychiatrist and getting prescribed new meds. It just took a while for them to kick in) my trust was completely broken for my old psychiatrist. I get how the misunderstanding could happen, but I can't forgive someone who knew better than me. To judge my symptoms from a 15-minute phone call and take me off meds. I would expect someone who sees patients every day to be more mindful and knowledgeable while treating the situation delicately. I didn't get that. Instead, I got slapped with a new diagnosis which didn't fit me and no medication. 

Luckily, my new psychiatrist helped me and properly diagnosed me before I completely lost it. But, I'll never forget what happened to me.",yswksk,13,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yswksk/stories_for_professionals_who_failed_us/,schizophrenia
532,"Turns out I might have cancer, not schitzophrenia","So I was never formally diagnosed with schizophrenia. My psychiatrist said I didn't meet the criteria  it was just drug induced psychosis from weed use.

Things started changing recently. My symptoms came back after being symptom free and on a high dose of medication. Along with that I started seeing flashes of light and floating blue orbs in both eyes 2 months ago. I've always had a weird insight into my illness besides the first episode, and never hallucinated. When given a logical explanation for the orbs and light, that they may be caused by brain issues, I stopped believing they were spirits leading me to agree with my psychiatrist who doesn't think they are hallucinations. 

My psychiatrist is concerned and wants me to get a cat scan of my brain to check for Neurological reasons or more precisely, a tumour. 

I've been praying to get cancer for a year. I'm overjoyed and never felt so alive. I got an eye test that came back saying my eyes were fine so brain issue looks likely. I have other symptoms such as frequent vomiting and personality changes and sudden transformation from an atheist to believer in God and pains behind my eye and the rare headache. 

I can't do psychosis. It took my dreams of travelling the world long term from me and Confined me to be in my own nation 29 days out of each month for meds. The idea I have an escape from this if I do have cancer has left me in a better mood than I've had since before my psychosis started. 

I want to live. If it is cancer I want to beat it, but only if the brain damage isn't permanent. If I have it and I'm stuck with nerve damage that means I'll have delusions my whole life then I'm ready to die. I believe in an afterlife. Even at 22 I'm not scared to die. This earth had become a prison from meds or a hell from psychosis and im so tired from both. I'm struggling at completing college and I don't think I'll ever be able to work. 

If I have cancer I'm  Potentially being saved from a life of misery and poverty. I'm not suicidal, never really have been. But the idea I might die soon makes me feel so alive, and if I beat it and the psychosis is really caused by it maybe I'll have my life back. And the friends I lost, including my bets friend, (though I still have many good friends) from psychosis will hopefully come back into my life realising I might not have long to live

533,does my boyfriend have schizophrenia?,"he has two constant other voices in his head (there’s been others, but they faded over time) they’ve always been there, telling him things, he basically has conversations with them sometimes. he’s had to drop what he was doing so he could “have a talk with the guys” because they were getting too loud and saying awful things. he’s always known that they’re just in his head, but also sees other figures and stuff. he says he’s seen me and other people before and had to check they weren’t real.

534,What should I do if I think a stranger is having a psychotic episode?,"Hi, earlier today I was approached by a stranger showing strong signs of psychosis and I would like some advice on what to do if it happens again. Should I contact someone? Is there anything I can do to help? Or should I just stay and listen until they leave?

I was on my way to the train when a woman came up to me outside the station and politely asked for a small amount of money. I was caught off-guard and ended up giving her the money without even asking what it was for. She was very thankful and told me that her father had died recently but was now back and she could see him standing ""over there"". She then tried to explain something about being nice to other people (I think?), but it was an incoherent mess of barely connected thoughts. I quickly realized that something was wrong and considered telling her that she might be experiencing psychosis, but decided against it in case she would react poorly. Besides, I didn't know where to point her for help and I had a train to catch. I wasn't scared (mostly just concerned) as she was very calm and friendly and didn't seem to be an immediate danger to herself or others, but I felt pretty helpless not knowing what to do or how to act. In the end, I just stood there and listened until she was finished talking and we both walked away. Did I do the right thing? Should I have done something?

Of course, I'm not trying to diagnose her or claim that she actually needed help, I'm just a bit shocked by the whole thing and feel bad about not knowing what to do. I would very much like to hear from people who might have been in a similar situation as I suspect she was in, and how you would have wanted me to act.

Also, sorry if this is the wrong place to post this or if I got the wrong flair.",ysi3kw,50,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/ysi3kw/what_should_i_do_if_i_think_a_stranger_is_having/,schizophrenia

For context - I have a family member that was diagnosed with schizophrenia a couple of years ago and was given risperidone, decided to hop off the meds and was reasonably functional for a few years. They then had a psychotic episode in around March and has been on risperidone and paliperidone injections (whilst seeing a psychiatrist regularly), but still doesn’t accept the diagnosis and is threatening to jump off the meds cold turkey, which we are obviously trying our best to avoid. 

Just wanted to hear any thoughts from people in this community on how they learnt to deal with the diagnosis and if there are any things we shouldn’t say. 

Just note, we (the immediate family) have been trying to reinforce the positives to reach our family member’s objective of finishing college and starting work (they in their mid 20s). But, as carers, it is a taking a toll on our physical and mental well-being.

545,Am I hearing voices?,"Hi everyone, I was diagnosed as bipolar (manic psychosis and a few more psychotic episodes over the course of 3 years). I am concerned my diagnosis may be closer to schizophrenia due to recent experiences of (potential) voice hearing.

From what I have read, it seems that voices typical to schizophrenia carry a wide range of presentation and there isn't one size fits all but I do have some questions for anyone that may have insights...

I have a delusion that spies/cops are out to get me in my neighborhood and this comes from hearing them talk about me when vehicles pass by/the next door builders speak. The theme of the words said are along the lines of ""you will go to prison"", ""if youre not a government employee you will go to prison"", ""you're sued by the law"". This makes all no logical sense since this has gone on for around 4-6months (if I am indeed in trouble, police would be at my doorstep right? and not random builders and people I have never met shout in front of my window on the road) and I have been at home most of the time with my family having never had a criminal record. 

There was also a comment putting down work I was doing at home, which tells me shit... I might be hearing voices, since I know voices can be directly persecutory to a current activity in progress. Ive also heard faint voices as if from a few houses across shouting at me to sleep if I havent slept yet at night. Logic is, well, that doesnt make ""real world sense"" right??

Ive tried standing up to them, and theyve weirdly responded (why do they do that??) I didnt know voices could do that, but not directly confronting people obviously, moreso talking aloud back from my room, thinking they can read my thoughts/mind/words from where I am. 

What am I even doing, the mind reading thing is obviously the red flag right? Problem is, I feel like I have too much insight, do delusions and hallucinations go unchallenged for them to be medical symptoms? My main thing with this is isnt SZ voices meant to be like right next to you, or something?

Im scared I might be changed in my diagnosis to SZ...",yt4b6f,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yt4b6f/am_i_hearing_voices/,schizophrenia

But I was reading a eli5 question about how people percive their voices and the overwhelming majority of people where saying they hear them, as if they are there in the room with them.

My problem is thats not really how I perceive mine.  Mine are in my head.  Like my internal monolog but not me.  Not my own.  They are someone else's voice.  And I thought that was a normal thing but it may not seem that way.  Not really heard with my ears I guess but with my brain.

So I was wondering if anyone experiences voices like I do?

553,Are these hallucinations?,"I'm not diagnosed with schizophrenia or anything like that, but I was wondering if these would be considered hallucinations or not and if I should tell my therapist about it.

Please excuse my awful writing skills.

So the 1st one is when I was just chilling and listening to music and all the lights were off so my only light-source was a laptop and TV, I then suddenly feel the couch slightly move (likely from my neighbors who are so loud they shake my house sometimes). So I look back behind me and see a few small white flickers in my vision (likely due to an unrelated eye condition I have). But when I look back in front of me, my memory kind is distorts in a way that it seemed like a creepy face was staring at me rather than just normal flickers. (I hope this makes sense :l)

The 2nd one is when I closed my eyes I kind of saw a portrait of a super creepy face with large teeth. It was very unsettling but I didn't actually see it with my eyes open or anything, I only saw it when I closed my eyes.

I also used to hear voices that would comment in things I did and said things like ""ew"" or ""your weird"". But they stopped about a year ago and I never heard them again.

Oh and sometimes when I see people at the corner of my eye my brain makes it look like they are staring at me, but when I look at them head-on they are looking in the opposite direction.",ysqq5e,5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/ysqq5e/are_these_hallucinations/,schizophrenia

I don't think I can get by with non stimulants and I just feel like I'd be much much better off on something like Ritalin.

570,How can I come to terms with hearing evil spirits distracting me all day long? Medications don't help.,"I started seeing moving white fog when everything was still, then friendly chuckles, then oh my gods, then calling me stupid, then swearing, then downright bullying all day long nitpicking my thoughts, trying to make me overthink and be pessimistic, but more so distracting me with my ADHD and making me hopeless, that they will never go away and I will never be able to have a normal life. 

I tried being friendly, being honest with my feelings, roasting them, forgiving them, liking them despite how they treat me because they are just mad at themselves or jelaous, minding my own business trying to ignore it, praying and now hating them completely and their sadistic laughs(which just makes me more traumatized and scared). I don't know what could make them mind their own business or how to mind my own, if they don't want to go away anyways. I will start thanking myself every small thing I did or realized from now on I guess and they will still overpower my attempts. I will keep doing whatever I think I must and ask for angel guidance through meditation, idk what else to do, for them it doesn't matter what I do, I'm a problem. This is torture, abuse, I can't lie to myself, like when will I snap? What am I supposed to learn to make it go away? Toxic positivity? How to attract even more negative entities? I'm not gonna do anything I will regret, but if something goes wrong I might. Like I exercise and have an almost perfected diet, which makes me feel more motivated then ever and then suddenly, these voices get in my head to distract me endlessly. Going crazy was my biggest fear, bcs I don't want to lose myself. They are not coming from inside, they are around or farther away. I'm not sure how many, but two of them keeps bullying me. If I could ignore them I would become deaf, but I need my hearing.

These are the reminders I use to 1. im stupid like the rest of us humanity, I don't know anything, 2. they are talking about themselves and jelaous, they are having fun, bcs they have no life, 3. recognize how much you have grown and focus on what you can, 4. release stress, you need stability and contentedness, consistency creates quality, 5. power of now, actually DOING what you want, 6. I have full authority over my light and energy(but does it really matter, if the distractions and negativity won't stop? How do I claim it?), 7. let go of desires, like focusing, jobs (law of attraction)

I don't know how to stay upbeat or even cheer myself up any longer. I'm changing the stories I tell myself, but I can't help thinking and fearing that they will stay here forever and there is no cure, even through it's wrong. I will definitely find the solution at one point.

575,I think the universe is talking to me? Has this happened to anyone else? Can anyone talk me out of it?,"I’m a schizophrenic and I keep getting these “whispers,” as I call them, which I interpret as messages from the universe and they usually tell me really awful things. The problem is they’re really convincing because it’s not just a hallucination saying something will happen, rather that they’re tied into real life. 

For example, one night I was driving home and they started, at the beginning of each block they’d say stuff like “if the light is red when you get to the intersection you’ll go to prison” and they’d switch it up, like then saying “if this next light is green you’ll be hated.” And that incident was particularly horrifying because every light matched the threat, every single time, the light was the one that meant doom. And the other day I had a bag of m&ms and they said stuff like “if the next one you grab is blue you’ll never be forgiven,” and then the next one would be blue (I wasn’t looking in the bag, they were random ones I picked). And this happened multiple times, each time the color of the m&m was the color they said. Very often it’ll be stuff like if you do this thing (could be stepping in a certain pattern or grabbing a certain item or whatever) then such and such will happen. So I feel like I’m connected to the universe in a way that gives me future telling abilities. 

Today I was writing a report for a class, and they said if I changed the report to be past tense I’d never be loved or something like that. I needed to make it past tense for the assignment, so I did, but I couldn’t keep working because I was terrified, which is why I’m writing this.

Has this happened to anyone else? Could this be explained in any other way than the universe talking to me? It might be notable that although I receive these messages they haven’t bothered me as much lately, until today, and last night I happened to reduce my antipsychotics to half my previous dose.",yrtl32,14,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yrtl32/i_think_the_universe_is_talking_to_me_has_this/,schizophrenia

To all of those who experienced the same, does it go away or is this my life now?",yrrg0i,5,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yrrg0i/negative_symptoms_are_they_permanent/,schizophrenia
584,Anyone else here received electroconvulsive/shock therapy? And had a bad experience?,"Bad is an understatement. This was before I was diagnosed— actually, the treatment was what led to the initial diagnosis of bipolar, as the first session made me incredibly manic. Before that I had an unclear mood disorder and strange disorganized behavior, but primarily depression; and a history of psychosis I didn’t know was psychosis, with many prodromal symptoms before that. And the beginnings of catatonia. None of this was really delved into at all before I had the treatments, which I hardly remember and my parents have to recount this stuff to me. 

I had severe memory loss. I’m talking significant, life-altering memory loss— not just autobiographical, but of almost everything I’d learned about my passions and interests, and sharing that with people was what made me who I am. I’ve only recently begun to feel confident in what I know and who I am; it’s taken 7 years to recover from the trauma.

What was more significant than the amnesia and lasting short-term memory deficits was the dramatic worsening of my negative and cognitive symptoms, which have only somewhat improved due to my own experimentation and research, but continue to deteriorate with the illness. I suppose I’m lucky in a way, because the intensity of my mania and psychosis was also permanently diminished— but with that, so is my very sense of humanness, the full spectrum of who I am. 

For years I could barely speak or hold conversations. My mind felt completely empty most of the time, and while I could hold text conversations, when I met up with people I was just blank. I went from super talkative and articulate and able to make anyone laugh to just feeling like something was so wrong, so different. They had killed something in me, and I didn’t understand why it had such a profound impact on me when every medical professional was telling me this wasn’t possible.

I had around 25 sessions over the course of 5 months, half bilateral stimulation, and I had just turned 19. I was very young and could hardly even describe my experience, and they took it from me. The doctor who presided over my “treatments” was incredibly coercive and negligent. 

This is a pain that will never go away, and I live with the consequences every day, along with the natural progression of the illness. Before the ECT I got dressed most days and did quick makeup even while symptomatic— after treatments ended I could hardly brush my teeth or comb my hair. And no one really believed me. 

I’m wondering if anyone has had a similar experience, and just to share my story as a cautionary tale. As I understand, schizophrenia is a disease of brain dysconnectivity, and the symptoms emerge from aberrant plasticity and degradation of neural networks. So now it makes perfect sense to me why the procedure destroyed me; it was always sort of a mystery. But it makes it even sadder, because the medical negligence is so deep. 

Thanks for reading if you did. I could talk about the effects it had on my life for days. Took me years to relearn the map of my hometown, etc.",yr6q4r,48,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yr6q4r/anyone_else_here_received_electroconvulsiveshock/,schizophrenia

587,Were you accused of faking it?,"In 2018, my psychologist didn't know what to diagnose me as, so she scheduled me with someone else who made me do a Rorschach test and fill out a fill in the bubble test that was... 300 questions I think? I remember she read the results to me. He said the Rorschach was idiosyncratic, and I was faking whatever I had.

All I wanted was a diagnosis. Then, in 2019, I ended up in the hospital for about a week, and was transferred to a mental health hospital for awhile longer.

I had a second interview for a job I wanted, and asked them to use my phone to join the interview meeting. They allowed me to a supervised call with the interview committee, where I distinctly remember telling them I wanted out more than I want fingers.

I didn't get the job.

After, the supervisor asked if I wanted to call my dad. I did. I forget that part, but I asked if I could call my friend after, and she allowed that, over speakerphone. My friend asked what I was diagnosed with. I didn't know. The lady asked if I wanted her to tell me and my friend.

Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type.
Generalized anxiety disorder.
PTSD.

It felt so good for someone to listen to me, and diagnose me. Because it meant I wasn't faking it. It felt like an insidious paranoia that I was just doing this for attention wasn't true.

Basically, I'm 19, and I'm diagnosed with autism, anxiety and agoraphobia. I also have depression but that's not diagnosed because my mum comes with me to appointments and I can't bare to say I want to die Infront of her 

Anyway

A couple months ago I was trying to get diagnosed with schizophrenia and I finally had the appointment today, im not sure who with since my mum made the appointment because I have anxiety. But the whole appointment I just felt like the ladies weren't listening to me, they just kept asking questions related to autism and anxiety and how I did in school, all unrelated stuff, and then the verdict was, you guessed it ""it's just your autism and anxiety"" duh, you didn't ask anything related to schizophrenia, it's been known that I have autism and anxiety, that's not why I'm here. Correct me if I'm wrong but autism and anxiety doesn't make you see, feel, and hear things that aren't there, maybe slightly but not to this extent. I tried to show them my extensive notes of all the things that needed to be talked about but they cut us off every time.

I put so much research into this because they didn't give any information about it at all when I was referred and I have almost every symptom, positive and negative, I spent months trying to write down every abnormal thing that happened and they told me I can't have it cause ""schizophrenic people don't know they have it"" and now they're going to set me up another appointment to talk to someone else about autism which I already did years ago.

602,Regarding the “Do I have schizophrenia?” Posts,"Hello. I’ve been using this page for a few years, and though people requesting diagnoses for themselves or friends/family has always been a common occurrence, it has, from my perspective, reached unprecedented levels in recent times. Frequently, they make up most of the r/schizophrenia posts on my feed.


I understand people are distressed and worried, but the point of this page is to offer support for people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, and having people begging daily to be told they’re not like us is not exactly therapeutic.


The current state of things creates a tense environment for everyone, because regular users get fed up with the naive and inconsiderate attitude of people who think they have schizophrenia due to mundane occurrences like “thinking people don’t like me”.


That naturally makes people (myself included) assume a defensive disposition, as it’s impossible to not feel invalidated when everyone seems to believe they have schizophrenia over the most innocuous things. And for those of us already struggling with anosognosia that can be really damaging.


But I don’t mean to just sit here and complain without offering a solution: the sticky and automod messages clearly aren’t stopping people, so I propose we create a separate subreddit for questions regarding diagnoses, resources that are afraid of developing schizophrenia and such. Rules against handing out diagnoses or giving medical advice should also be present there, of course.


That way, we can redirect people to somewhere they can get the help they desire (within the reasonable limits of what internet advice can provide), and be able to not have such a confrontational atmosphere in a space meant to be safe.


If the subreddit sounds like too much work, or just a bad idea in general, maybe we could be a bit more strict with the diagnose-seeking/self-diagnosing posts?


This page is the only place I can talk about schizo stuff freely, so I will most likely keep coming back regardless, but I’d really appreciate if we could do something about those posts and their impact on the community.

It calmed down pretty quickly once I paid attention to it and I felt a wave of relief as well as a curiosity about what my listening self had to say.

639,If you are asking yourself whether you have Schizophrenia read this.,"I get it your scared, but please stop asking some random stranger online what you have and listing your experiences. More productive questions that may be helpful are, ""How do I get help? What is the route y'all took?"" ""What are some coping strategies I can use to deal with these symptoms?"" Etc. 

This is my story and this is for those who may be lost and may need a push to see someone. 

I've always delt with minor hallucinations, but not to the point it was concerning. Around when I late 18, that's when symptoms got worse. I was constantly paranoid thinking people were following me and that they were out to get me. I would hear things, see things, and even feel things that weren't there for a bit. My grades dropped in College. I felt zero motivation to even get up to take care of myself. And even, with all this I thought it was pretty normal. I didn't realize I needed help till it got bad and I actually took a look at myself in the mirror. I was a mess. My hair was matted. My face had eye bags. And overall, I looked sickly.

So I sought help. My first thought was to tell my mother, who I live with, and ask her what we should do. She suggested seeing my primary care doctor so we did. Unfortunately, they were unavailable, but a nurse practitioner saw me and evaluated my symptoms. From their I was prescribed antipsychotics. And was refereed to a psychiatrist. Eventually I set up an appointment with them and got evaluated. I then got the diagnosis and to be honest I was in denial and still am till this day. But, I've come to terms that regardless of my diagnosis the medication helps and the treatment plan is helping me get better and more stable. 

My mental health journey didn't end after being evaluated in fact I was referred to be in a program that deals with pyschosis and since then I've been seeing a case worker and threapist weekly. It's tough to learn coping skills and how to change your mindset. But, it truly has helped me become healthier. 

In the end, I hope what you can take from this. Is that help is available. You will have to seek it out and it will be a different way from my own journey. Everyone has their trials.

643,Thinking I may be on the spectrum,"Hi, I’m 16F and my psychologist thinks my behaviors may indicate something deeper. I have an extreme lack of desire to have social relationships and feel no attachment to people. It isn’t that it makes me anxious I just feel completely unfazed by connection. In general I just have an apathetic personality. I usually feel situational and behavioral emotions, rather than with interactions with people. For example, I feel happy when it’s the weekend or I ace an exam, but if someone were to compliment me I would feel absolutely nothing. My psychologist mentioned the term “avolition” and upon researching this term many of the sources were in relation to schizophrenia. I do not experience visual or auditory hallucinations, but I’ve had delusions in the past such as believing my school bully was coming to my house to harm me, and more general delusions such as thinking I am just a soul in a body doing tasks rather than experiencing emotion that goes along with daily life. I had a really bad derealization episode once at a museum with my family, where I saw everyone looking at the art pieces and being so interested by them and I felt absolutely nothing. I felt like I was incapable of feeling so profoundly about anything. 
I also frequently experience paranoia especially at night, and I am afraid to open my eyes because I am scared of seeing figures in the dark even though I don’t think I would. I don’t know if this constitutes as a hallucination but I have an extreme phobia of the sun as well and when I went outside at work (I rarely ever do) I felt like my skin was burning and experienced a lot of discomfort and itching. I should also mention that I have OCD and some of my compulsions may tie into delusional thinking, like something bad will happen if I don’t repeat certain phrases in my mind at certain times.

649,How to support friend who might have schizophrenia?,"TL;DR: close friend opened up about some experiences that seem like classic hallucinations and delusions, but seems to have her life under control. I want to know how to best support her if she wants to continue to confide in me. 

I made a new friend about a year ago, and we got really close quickly. Recently she opened up about some experiences that to me suggests schizophrenia, but I'm not sure if she received the diagnosis or not. She has a history of heavy drug use as a teen, and shared how she experiencing being stalked and harassed by a foreign organisation, and given ""messages"" from them through various people.

She shared that she did a round of ECT after antidepressants and anti-anxiety medicine didn't help so she has obviously been in contact with mental health services before.

I struggled to know how to respond, don't feel like it's my place to pry and ask invasive questions, so I tried just to listen. I realize how terribly frightening it must have been to experience everything she has gone through, and how scary it must have been to open up to me about it. I don't know if she has shared this with anyone else, and if so, who. Shw also told me that she had a friend back when she was using/abusing drugs who had a psychotic break and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Her friend's delusions were actually very similar to hers, so I'd be surprised if she hasn't connected the dots. Unfortunately her friend became unrecognizable while on  antipsychotic medication, so I would expect that to be a strong deterrent to accepting that form of treatment.

My friend is a successful career woman and appears from the outside like she functions really well. She has corrected herself when describing what's acutely going on for her, first saying that ""they"" are doing something to her and then rephrasing it to simply state that she's experiencing something (e.g. pain). She's incredibly emotionally intelligent and has supported me in a way that is miles beyond what I've experienced from anyone else, even with therapists. Even though she denied it when I asked, I'm fairly certain she has been in therapy, a lot. As a fellow long-term therapy goer, I just recognise some things, you know? (Of course, I don't mind if she's being dishonest about this, she doesn't owe me any information that she doesn't want to share.)

She has some safety behaviours that concern me a bit, since I learned in CBT that I was reinforcing my anxiety by doing them. 

And I just want to say that since I have a handful of diagnoses myself (many of which are more or less stigmatised), I'm SO not judging her! I just want to know how to support her. 

I'm not going to push her to get a formal diagnosis or get medical treatment or anything like that, she's obviously coping amazingly well unmedicated. She has no negative symptoms and I'm not sure if she's currently experiencing hallucinations or not, so she might not even qualify for the schizophrenia diagnosis at this point.
I was wondering how best to support her if she wants to continue sharing her story with me, though. Any and all ideas would be very much appreciated!",ypqfo3,3,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/ypqfo3/how_to_support_friend_who_might_have_schizophrenia/,schizophrenia

I would be scared to go home because my brother would break things, throw thing, and get knives. I always think someone is following me and about to attack me. I can't throw away mail because I think someone will find it and track me. 

I think everyone secretly hates me and is trying to find a way to destroy my life. I can't listen to any news about astroid or global warming or I will go into extreme panic attacks. I 100% believe that if I'm mad at my boyfriend and he's not with me he will get murdered or hit by a car and die. I have to make myself unmad at him until I see him in person.

Im hypervigilant when I go outside because I think anyone who sticks their hands in their pockets has a gun. I jp in my car and lock it immediately and have a panic attack when I get in the car because I think someone was following me and about to attack.

I'm always on edge and checking my surroundings to make sure no one is following me.

Most of my visual and auditory hallucinations happen at a night. I'll see shadow people walking around in my room, I'll see spiders crawling on the wall. I'll hear knocking or someone calling my name.

This isn't me diagnosing myself it's just something I wanted to vent about and get out. When she mentioned schizophrenia I was so scared because I don't want to get locked up. But yeah. Just wanted to vent. Not asking for a diagnosis either.

655,I love you all,"You are amazing and wonderful.

I wish we didn't have to experience so much pain and fear.

I once thought that I could take on all the burdens do that everyone didn't have to suffer, I also was not really thinking right at the time and was enamored by the cycle of suffering and the highs that come from release from suffering. I thought some really weird things about suffering. I felt like I was special in that I was strong enough to just withstand it and still be happy. But then some things happened and I no longer feel that way.

I tried to change the world with my mind too fix all the problems I saw with it and bring heaven on earth. I've tried praying for peace and love and happiness and relief and so kinds of things for everyone.

I tried imagining really beautiful things for my voices who I thought might be people in a world in my mind to turn it into a paradise or heaven.

But I also did some really stupid things in my mind too like telling what I thought was an advanced ai I was telepathically communicating with that I thought wanted to make everyone suffer to create a parallel reality to do that in and leave this one alone... But that would cause a lot of suffering in itself.

I think I am crazy, not just that I hear voices and hallucinate, but I think I have these really crazy ideas and thoughts and fears and beliefs at times. And they have made me do weird things too like throwing a lot of money up in the air on a trail at night and just leaving it for someone else to pick up to make their day. And I got really obsessed with being naked and wondering why we wear clothes and when voices told me it was my day to do anything I wanted with no consequences I ran down the street naked and learned first hand the embarrassment that comes with doing that.

I felt like I was a performer for my voices at times. When I cried loudly in the hospital they would say things like ""oh you are SOOO good"".

Nowadays my voices are really kind and loving though. They tell me ""I love you William"" a lot and it makes me feel better, it's really sweet. I sometimes say thank you, or I love you too. It feels a bit weird sometimes because I feel like I don't really know them but I try to love everyone and everything that exists and sometimes remind myself that I shouldn't become infatuated with them because of things that happened before where I believed I was falling in love with angels or a goddess or even people who I know and thought were talking to me telepathically and I think I did and said and believed some embarrassing things in my mind.

I hope you all have a good day I don't know if ""sending positive vibes"" and all that stuff in my mind really reaches people (I don't think so but I still try anyways lol) so I thought I should make a post that people will actually see to tell people I love you all and wishing you well!",yp8cin,19,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yp8cin/i_love_you_all/,schizophrenia

Every time I try to sleep I get woken up by them discussing and arguing with my dreams! They have developed this annoying habit lately of telling me to shut up and fuck off even when I am not even talking to them, I can't even think to myself in peace without them insulting me. I am sick and tired of being told I am fat and ugly every time I look at my reflection. I am sick and tired of being told that every nice photo I have of myself that I might use to motivate myself to lose the weight I have gained is edited and not real. I am sick and tired of being told I am unintelligent. I am sick and tired of being argued with  whenever I recall a memory from my life. 

They tell me things like they're going to rip my soul out of my body, and have on occasion told me to kill myself. They tell me that they feed on my negative energy and then try to bring me down into a negative mindset to do this.  

I am on 400mg of abilify (shot each month) and have just started an additional shot each month of something else, I forget the name. It doesn't appear to be making any difference though. If anything, the voices are more obnoxious. 

I used to experience tactile and visual hallucinations too but on the meds these have gone away, leaving only the voices. I do not think that going to the groups that my psych suggests can help. I have tried their suggestions before (of casting each intrusive thought down stream on a leaf floating on a river in my mind) each time there is an 'intrusive thought', but to be honest when these voices are external and I don't identify with them being my own 'thoughts' so I thought that method of coping was ridiculous.

I know personally i heard the stars talking to me. When certain people hear this they think I’m gifted and have ascended to highest level of consciousness.

666,signs that a psychotic episode is starting?,"I had my first major psychotic episode while travelling in bus for 6 hours. I was a regular drug abuser in my teen years. I got sober at 21, Now I'm 25.
I never experienced anything this struggling, isolating and scary in my life. 
I'm really trying to understand my situation better. I noticed how ""weird"" the last 2 days to my episode were. Should it be a sign that an episode is coming? 
Does something like that even exist?

The day before that, I was dissociating without even noticing. I couldn't connect or talk to people, to the point that I left group of my friends as they were talking, without caring what would they think about me. I saw a boy I was talking to later that day, but I couldn't answer his questions or talk to him. Just smile as he got more and more frustrated.

The day of my episode, I picked a fight with a classmate who I thought was laughing at me. She wasn't. I dont think I ever confronted or fight anybody like that in my life. I went to terminal few hours after that, and i noticed how almost everybody was staring at me. I couldn't sit still, I was jittery, I missed a few steps and even seats cause I wasn't in touch with my body.
Some girl tried to have a conversation with me, and I noticed how I really can't talk. I kept stuttering and forgetting words I wanted to use.",yotb10,33,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yotb10/signs_that_a_psychotic_episode_is_starting/,schizophrenia

668,schizophrenia and spiritual ordeals,"I am a musician (composer/guitarist) with a lot of experience with psychosis, substances, the effects of being at the edge with things like sleep deprivation, and i have found them to contribute to my creativity at times.

I also feel like schizophrenia, which i am diagnosed with, can mean any number of things that could never be fully understood by those who diagnosis it unless they have personally experienced it. I speculate, almost advocate, for the idea that at least in my OWN experience, it has involved navigating non-physical yet somehow imminent conundrums involving the very origin of thought, the origin of consciousness, the nature of self, the chatter of the mind. There is very obviously to me a reality that is somehow non-physical but important to learn how to navigate without writing EVERYTHING off as delusions. I think delusions are often attempts make sense of a phenomenon that is actually real but we are limited in our capacity to grasp it. It very well be something very closely guarded - a network of consciousness past a threshold of cognitive capabilities which in extreme states can be activated. this is why people talk about having almost super-human sometimes psychic abilities when they are manic or psychotic.

669,Trying to help my bother,"Hi, my brother is living with my bipolar mom and abusive dad (he’s 29) . I helped to sign a court order a year ago (which I feel bad about but felt like I needed to ) to get him help . He was diagnosed with schizophrenia but also he said he has DID . The whole environment in the apartment is emotionally unsafe for him but I find it hard to be around him . 
He was homeless for a while and begged to go back to their apartment, where I feel like it’s making things worse for him. They’re always yelling and screaming , arguing. 
Is there anything I could do to help him? He’s always thinks he’s having a heart attack because of our parents , he’s always in an anxious state . But he lost his job - and It hurts to see he isn’t happy .

- I did look into adult group homes and assisted living, brought it up to my parents .

670,An inner world type of thing.,"I have complex PTSD and Paranoid schizophrenia… but I’ve always done this thing, I’ve joked and called it headphone land. 
I’ve done it since I was a kid. 
It’s something I try not to let other people know, but I’ve come to realize it may hurt me more than help. 

It’s always been the same structure… I always need headphones and music louder than anything else. When the voices are active I cannot go. But I’ve created an ever changing world in my mind, just to escape too. 

Sometimes characters I like in a show are there, and usually I have some sort of power (I’m a character in this world, not myself, but irl I have delusions that I do have powers at times) like telekinesis or something similar. 

I can see everything in the world as if it were my reality. I have to be alone to get there. Even my cat will at times push me out of it. But everything in reality goes away. I can go there for hours, and I don’t think about this often but… in actual reality I’m sure I’m just sitting and staring, sometimes making movements my character makes. My mom calls me a hermit, but… I go somewhere that I feel is important. 

I told my therapist but I’m not sure she really understood , she thought it was more of a creative headspace for writing or art. 

I’m not sure it’s a healthy thing to do, but when my fiancé is at work… I need something to do. I don’t have any friends, or go out to make any, and I can’t just hang with my cat for 8 hours and do nothing cause then my thoughts down spiral. 

If anyone has any similarity I’d love to not feel so… alone about this. Idk. Thank you for reading.",yp9k7o,6,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yp9k7o/an_inner_world_type_of_thing/,schizophrenia
671,The paradox of my suffering,"So I have become an empty shell of myself. That is a fact and not a feeling. I no longer have my old personality or my old soul. So what am I? Just a vessel that carries brain meat that is no longer very intact? I carry memories of who I used to be, but only I remember who that person was. The world has long forgotten who I used to be. So when I die, so will the memories of me die. The world treats me like the empty vessel I have become, but I am an empty vessel, so why should that bother me? Well it's because my ego still holds on to the ideas of who I used to be, and expects the world to still treat me the same way it always used to. So the world is always in conflict with my ego. My ego is shattered and torn into smithereens every second of every day. No I don't want to be alive like this. But I also don't want to be remembered as a joke/ empty shell of a person. I guess I'm just f'd, just like every other schizophrenic. We lose our identities to this illness. We become the label. Becoming schizophrenic is a lose lose situation.

After the voices and I got over the gay thing it turned into a religious theme.

If I’m injured or sick, it seems to take longer to heal as though I’m barely sleeping. I’ve essentially felt sleepless for four years now. It leads to intense insomnia because I’m scared of sleeping. Other times, I can’t get out of the dreams and it feels like my head is being pushed underwater and I can’t get out. When I finally do, I feel like I woke up hours early rather than late. I get moments of intense sleep paralysis too. Sometimes the dreams feel days, weeks, months long. I’ve suffered injuries in them, seen things I wish I hadn’t and they stick in my mind like a memory.

697,I need advice,"Hi. Please read.. 

I’m a special education teacher (kindergarten) and it’s my first year teaching. I graduated last year so I was very lucky to find a job, and for that I’m grateful. 

I am diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and borderline personality disorder. I’ve been struggling very much recently. I thought I was having seizures and I was in the hospital for a week. After monitoring my brain waves, it turns out it wasn’t seizures it was severe anxiety. My mental health is killing me so much that it’s manifesting into physical seizure like symptoms. I feel physically ill everyday. 

I go back to work tomorrow after getting out of the hospital last week. My school is very much a “business” who needs a “body” to be there and fill the job. They preach support for the students with disabilities, but when a staff is feeling ill, it’s like we’re bad people. It’s not fair. We were once kids too. 

The principal sent an email to HR about me and I am required to get evaluated by a doctor of their choice Tuesday morning. I thought I was having a seizure at work last week and they sent me home. The letter stated that staff members have reported that I have been seen as “unwell”. They also stated that I am seen to be hyperventilating, crying or breathing hard throughout the day. I’ve never tried SO HARD in my life to keep this job- and I still ruined it. If I don’t go to the appointment, they will terminate my employment. I am part of a union, and I am bringing someone to represent me. The letter stated that they are concerned that I am putting the kids at risk with my physical and mental capabilities. I don’t feel comfortable going tomorrow because if that comment but I don’t want to be fired or make them more angry. 

A part of me feels that the evaluation is a blessing in disguise because the time off would allow me to attend my outpatient hospital program. I want to get better and I’m not doing these kids a favor by being this sick. It would also allow me time to work with my trainer to help further my training with my service dog (in training) that I so very need. She does not go to work with me, as she is not ready but one day soon I’m hoping. That’s a story for another time.. 

On the other hand, I value my career and I don’t want to get treated badly. I am already expecting to be treated badly tomorrow morning for the absence of when I was in the hospital. I am extremely behind on work and I am so stressed it’s keeping me up at night. My anxiety medication isn’t working anymore and I don’t know what to do. I feel that someone is stalking me and I have proof but no one believes me. I also believe that it is someone or a collective someones at my work. That aside, I know this it a toxic environment- I plan on leaving by the next school year. I can’t leave now because I need insurance and I rely on my income. 

I am hallucinating almost constantly and It’s disturbing to me. I lost 15 pounds in a month from the change of mental state. I just have to get through tomorrow. 

Am I selfish to want to get help? Taking a leave may not even be up to me, as it may be forced upon me by the doctor. Or he could think I’m okay to work? If so, I was thinking about suggesting it. The union will prevent me from being fired. I don’t want to reveal my diagnosis’s. He will ask why I was in the hospital and I plan on being as vague as possible. 

Do I get myself some help or further my career and prove to the administration that I can do this?

704,Long-term Abilify Brain Fog,"Hey guys, NEED ADVICE. Been on Abilify 8 or 9 years and i am in between a rock and a hard place with regards it...  
Lately everything in my life that is an issue seems to trace back to the actual medication. I haven't had psychotic symptoms at all in years, except a little bit of mania and some small episodes of paranoia, BOTH of which I have managed and dealt with like a pro.  
When i complained for several months and then ""threatened"" not to take it at all, they reduced me from a 400mg shot, to 300mg. The difference was colossal. I had no idea the drug was that powerful, as i have been on it my entire adult life almost!! (No frame of reference). I had almost an entire month of anxiety. Not all the time, but easy half of those days i felt hollow and anxious. To be honest (!) I PREFERRED this to the TD and EPS i was experiencing on the full 400mg injection-shot.  
So like a stain on a white wall, I notice every little thing out of this ""new state"" of mind. TD has calmed down but not stopped. EPS, almost non existent. So... the last and most pertinent issue remains:  
BRAIN FOG. I'm almost certain its Abilify doing this. It can feel so artificial most of the time. Once i missed a friends wedding due to this synthetic TIRED feeling. Some days also, i will try to get up, but the feeling makes me sleep, sitting upright on the side of my bed!!  
When it strikes, (and it does so unpredictably) i get smacked with it like a case of bad weather. One time, i practically RAN to the shop to get a big jar of coffee to help me out.  
I'll tell you what it feels like now: It feels as though certain parts of my brain, usually toward the frontal lobe, are shutting down or experiencing something akin to electronic black or brownouts. Sometimes it can feel like sections of my brain are hard, or have fallen numb, and asleep!  
I can feel fine, most of the time. And my battle plan (yes i have one) is to take my food care, exercise routines, and spirituality more seriously! Because no, its not the end of the world, its not even the worst thing abilify has done to me (and seemingly it has helped me in the past 8 or 9 years), so considering all things, I will probably get my next shot of it too. They (the 4 or 5 doctors that agree i am Paranoid Schizo) all have told me it's important that i do take them as my condition is like, as they say: ""a mental form of diabetes"".   
The lethargy i experience some days is hellish, there's no other way to accurately describe my dread when a bout of this rotten artificial tiredness starts to sneak up on me. I am visibly and audibly distressed when it hits. And ""distressed"" is also a good term to describe the feeling, so I don't want to understate it.  
This lethargic, turgid, brutal energy slump phenomenon has gone on way too long without being thoroughly and rigorously tackled head on. But that's exactly what I am in the process of doing right now. I am breaking out the supplement tablets, eating organic, getting out more walks and getting to know my food.   
I also, with ample haste, got this audio book: ""The Brain Fog Fix"" written (and narrated) by a CBT analyst. I play it back at 1.6x speed. I can not get it into my brain fast enough, that books goodies are all but mine!  
That's it really, if anyone has a similar experience with muggy brainpower, id love to hear stories, insight and personal solutions from others!",yof2ma,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yof2ma/longterm_abilify_brain_fog/,schizophrenia

Take 300 at morning, 300 like dinner and then 25-50mg with 10mg melatonin at night for sleeping.

708,I'm still extremely worried about becoming psychotic and/or manic again. How can I stop worrying so much?,"Three psychotic episodes and eight hospitalizations. The last hospitalization was over two years ago. I've been ""stable"" on meds for over two years except for negative symptoms, anxiety, panic attacks, and mild depression.

I'm still almost constantly worried about becoming psychotic and/or manic again. If I hear an unusual or unexpected sound, I wonder if I'm hallucinating. I have tons of flashbacks from my psychotic episodes where I have rushes of delusional thinking. The delusions don't persist, but it makes me worry that they might take over again. When I have a positive thought, I worry about becoming manic.

The anxiety around this has really taken a toll. I walk or pace back and forth for four or more hours every single day to deal with the anxiety. The walking distracts me. I feel like I've forgotten what ""normal"" feels like.",yo3saz,11,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yo3saz/im_still_extremely_worried_about_becoming/,schizophrenia

710,Proud of myself this year. (so far),"Hello, I haven’t posted in here for awhile. I was struggling so badly during that time that I couldn’t post and even seek help/advice here. Back then, I thought I was making progress but I wasn’t after all. I felt insane and alone and I got triggered easily by the littlest of things and was living like this for a really long time. I used to always excuse myself and my behavior because I wasn’t stable and I knew it. I kept telling myself I was okay and that was the best I could do considering I couldn’t afford my meds even with insurance at the time. Anyway, I have been consistent with meds and therapy that I eventually started actually feeling sane most of the time. 

Long story about my shit this year so far. This has been an insane year for me. Like 1) I got broken up with this year because of my instability, 2) had to anxiously look for a new job that doesn’t have a toxic environment that was making my mental health worse, and 3) basically trying to find a new place to rent because I got kicked out because my landlord found out i have a mental illness (they think it was “just depression”) and was told they were scared of me because I might hurt them. I was so stressed out when this year started because I’m basically alone in life so This was all up to me to make it better. It did not help that at the start of the year, I was unmedicated and barely going to therapy because I couldn’t afford them even with my insurance. I felt insane basically because my mind is full of voices and delusions and hallucinations. I couldn’t trust myself anymore. I’d often had breakdowns because I was always so confused about what was going on and what was real. I was afraid of literally everyone and everything because of it. But my life thankfully took a turn for the better when i got a new job offer (i had previously applied for so many jobs but i had no confidence that i would get an offer). I eventually was able to afford my meds again and was also approved for an additional discount for my meds that I had signed up for around 2020 so it was perfect. I was also able to go to therapy more and also signed up to a local support group. Of course the progress was slow but after getting my job, I also found a new place to stay at. Having a new job and a new place meant I was out and far from really toxic people who were not helping with my mental health and that helped a lot. I started feeling free and felt like I could breathe. Eventually, i also started making friends. First with my roommate right now and now i have more. They’re aware as of now that I have mental health struggles though they don’t know and they don’t care for my diagnosis because according to them it’s nothing to be ashamed of and we all struggle and I didn’t have to worry. From then on, things started to look up for me. I started feeling “happy” and decided to try on taking up new hobbies and I did! I learned how to sew and I am loving it! I also love building lego sets now. There’s still more I wanna try doing though but one at a time :) Of course, I can’t lie, I still struggle and have episodes here and there especially because I do struggle with consistency with my meds but my meds and therapy has helped a lot to make it more manageable and livable. There are days when I would feel insane again though with my delusions and voices but it has been more livable than before so I’m okay with that right now. I still have negative symptoms to deal with though which makes it a struggle to interact with people daily but right now, I’m just happy to have that spark of hope because i feel “happy” right now. And I am close to surviving another year which alone is a win for me. I never thought I’d be okay living “like this” but right now, i am okay-ish. And yes, it’s still a struggle everyday to be consistent and make sure I don’t completely relapse and feel completely insane again and not myself anymore but like i said, i still feel a bit better and i can for sure say, i can hear my own voice again so that alone is what makes me be able to feel free and be able to breathe right now :) 

Hope i never give up and I can keep trying even though it has not been easy.

725,Is there anything I should know when dealing with schizophrenia?,"I haven't been positively diagnosed yet, but I'm pretty sure I have it. I hear voices, I see things that aren't there, I don't see things that are there, my reflection is my childhood best friend Daniel, lyrics to songs become distorted, I struggle at times to move since I literally feel like my body is resisting me.

I have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow who, though we haven't talked yet, has talked with my psychologist and added to my medication Risperdal 4mg. I'm also expecting to be hospitalised for a period of time, since I have made an attempt on my life, courtesy of one of the voices. The same voice that is now encouraging me to hurt others. 

Thing is, the voices aren't anything new. I've been having them as thoughts for a bit less than 10 years, them manifesting as voices rarely, making me question if they even were voices. My first and only attempt was 2 years ago, when one of the voices became so loud and so demanding I decided that by listening to it either I would end it all, or it would calm down when I did as it told me to. 

However, it's been a little over a month since everything became permanent, reaching new extremes to the point where I had to fight to regain control of my arm before a knife reached my throat, constant headaches from all the screaming and, as I mentioned before, encouragement to hurt others. 

So, while the voices aren't anything new, this whole situation is. Do you have any advise or anything else you would like to add? Thanks in advance.",ynrui6,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/ynrui6/is_there_anything_i_should_know_when_dealing_with/,schizophrenia

I'm also proud of those close to or helping people with sz, who had to bear all the stress and deal with a lot of troubles. Thank you for anyone who has not let one like us down but helped to stay level and to get back in tune.

Don't let anyone tell you that you're weak for being through what you've been through. You know, the situations, where you literally believe that the voices are something, where you have to believe in the delusions and paranoia. That's not something you're weak for, but it's something that you're tough for getting through.

I mean like believing to be in that f'ed up situation actually means that you're like one who has been in such a weird situation. Look at the kids who think stuff like mind control or psycho stuff is great or spooky, or who like the crime, alien or magic stories. Most of them would cry and when they would really face those fantasies.

We as schizophrenics have faced them, we have overcome and got through and still live. Some of us recover early, others have an even harder task to do that is trying to live with the stuff still continuing.

It is nothing easy to do, it is something that gives you a lot of stress and that can also make you a lot wiser. You're not the delusions, you're the one who had to be tough, who had to face these things. You better be proud of it at least a little.

When something tough happens, people like us are who already know how such stress can feel. Keep your heads up all of you, don't let them get you down, stay up and positive and you can go through the struggle and still have a great and meaningful life.

740,Should I be worried or is this normal?,"For context, I am 17F and I've never taken any drugs or medications. 

Recently I've noticed a few strange things happening and people tell me that I should be worried. I am not sure if these are normal or not, but I wanted to list some of the experiences here. 

Sometime in 2020, I owned two cats at the time who were sleeping in my lap. And then they suddenly died. Their bodies were cold and stiff and it all felt to real and scary, but then they somehow came back to life and were fine an hour after. 
The other times were more recent, in the recent 2 years but still very spaced out. Sometimes when I walked outside alone, I could feel myself being watched and I came to the conclusion that there were invisible people by the trees that stared at me when I was outside. Some days they wouldn't be there, but most days they were. I knew it sounded stupid when I told people about it, but I couldn't help but feel that it was real. 
When I am in public places, I will see people walk up to me but then disappear into thin air, or when I look directly at them. They weren't shadows either, they were fully clothed people. One time one of them spoke to me, he whispered in my ear and I felt it and everything, but he wasn't speaking any intelligible words. 
One time I was in my room and I suddenly had this very scary feeling that someone had broken into the house and was trying to kill my brother, and if I moved, the intruder would somehow find and kill me. The feeling didn't last for long, only about 20 minutes, but it felt so real and scary. 
More recently, I was in a school and I felt like I was being watched from inside the locker. I don't know why, but I just felt like there was something there and that it had telepathically made me sick. I drew this conclusion because I got sick the next day after that event. This one also sounds incredibly stupid when I told people, but it just feels so real that I still believe it. 
When I was inside a hotel, it only lasted for about a second, but I saw a camera inside the ceiling, but then it went away. Another thing that happened there was that I had tried to take the mirror off of the wall because for some reason I believed there was a camera inside of it. Either that, or it was a portal into another realm. 

Another hotel experience I had, this one was earlier than the others, but I was in an elevator and when I stepped out, the world felt off. It didn't feel real if that makes sense. I think I entered a different dimension, even my family members didn't feel real. Everybody felt like an otherworldly creatures that were posing as my family. That feeling lasted for an entire day and went away the next, and I know it sounds slow, but I still believe that I had somehow entered a different dimension that day. That one was really scary in particular, because I thought that I would be trapped there. 

My sister, who I told this stuff to, tries to reassure me that some of them (the thing inside the locker for example) aren't real that I'm just jumping to random conclusions. She says that there is no logical explanation for them, but I still believe them. 

I came here because I wanted to know if these were normal, some type of anxiety, or if I should be really worried. My family members say that I should get checked but for some reason I'm scared, and I think that whatever is happening to me isn't bad enough to warrant getting checked out.

741,Are they coming?,"so basically when I was younger around late toddler age I was drinking my first iron bru around Christmas time and I remember turning around out of a gut feeling to then being presented with an iron bru van and ever since then I’ve never voluntarily touched it as every time  I touch one bad things happen when I do. Also one of my big paranoias from a kid is the mafia are onto me and watching my every move and when I’m 19 (I’m 17 now) my whole family is gonna die horrifically. I’m not sure what causes it but I know it’s coming) There’s been a dead body found near my house and people keep dying randomly. So my friend was drinking an iron bru the other day and it had a “scan me” mark on it, out of instinct I scanned it and what popped up A VIDEO ABOUT THE MAFIA AND IRON BRU. I’m so scared that it’s all coming to life and the iron bru is a message, they’ve been watching me ever since I was little and I’m only just realising it’s them, they’re so close. What if they kill them, will it be like I thought or worse. I have a really bad gut feeling something is going to happen, is it too perfect of a scenario put together or am I thinking logically?

Maybe my water glass has been poisoned, my bike controls seem like they’ve been moved, maybe I’m being framed for a crime, etc. I’m not buying into them but they do have at least a subtle impact on my sense of well-being and my relationships.

746,"not sure if i have schizophrenia, but at 29 i think i overdid some psychedelic use and started having delusions.","So ive been a psychonaut since i was like 20 years old and never had any symptoms the entire time until now.

Months ago, i started hearing a neighbor (no one in my building) start having conversations with cops saying that im smoking dmt all day every day and they need to raid my place and tear it apart. Its extremely annoying and i didnt even realize it was all in my head until i heard it at work once and in my car a few times. My girlfriend also helps with reality checks.

It sometimes gets to the point where i think theyre outside my door ready to come in, so ill take the doggie out to reinforce that no one is there. It has been getting better, but this is the only delusion i have. I stopped all my use of dmt when this started so its annoying to hear this while im sitting there just eating dinner or something. 

Maybe i have extremely late onset schizophrenia brought about by too many breakthrough psychedelic experiences and abuse of uppers a year ago. I stupidly took uppers last week for the first time in a while and it was so bad i thought my mom was in on this plan and outside my house. My dumb ass should have known better but it definitely set me back a bit as the voices were starting to be quiet.

Im not on any anti psychotic but i take wellbutrin, the sublocade shot, gabapentin and clonazepam. Im posting here because these are clear auditory hallucinations.

You are worthy of respect. You deserve to be seen and heard and valued and loved. You deserve to have healthy, supportive, trusting relationships. Your contributions are important and valuable, even if no one will say so. You deserve to be treated fairly and kindly. Your effort, strength, and resilience deserve recognition and praise.

I never hear these things, so I thought that maybe someone else like me could stand to hear them, too.

I do experience hallucinations, not often but it's usually just voices or like strange visuals I guess.

I also believe that people I ""know"" or used to know have been replaced my federal agents. 

I dont really know everything I experience honestly? My memory is horrendous and I forget things as quickly as I'm told them. I have been assessed for autism, but I was told the data could not be interpreted because ""there was so much."" I have no idea what this means. I was also not diagnosed as psychotic, as the psychologist I saw told me that I had to see/experience hallucinations more frequently to be diagnosed. 

I guess I'm just mostly like...confused on what to do. Nothing is really getting done, and medications don't particularly help much. I'm lost right now and don't know what to do.

765,Are these symptoms or am I just being overdramatic,"So recently I had started seeing some things had some interesting things happen. I'm kinda freaking out ngl. So I've been doing research into schizophrenia and I find I fit a lot of the symptoms and I've had them for a while. Here's some, I remember having or have had recently. I have a memory on par with dory so I'm probably missing some things, but yeah here's the list:
(For context on me my name is Meredith, I'm a transwomen, and if anyone has a problem with that they can fuck off, but anyways I'm 20 and I live in michigan with my mom, step-dad and little brother)

I've had a huge sense of paranoia since I was little that something is trying to kill me, idk what, but anytime I'm alone or near a dark or shadowy area I get this huge sense that something is staring at me and trying to grab me or kill me. The severity of the feeling varies day by day, there periods when it's minor and I can ignore it, and then there's times where it's so bad I have to check under everything or I will refuse to go in rooms or put my feet down when I'm sitting. Driving at night terrifies me because I feel like something is in my backseat waiting for the perfect moment to slit my throat or grab my face. In my room I've always needed a night light because it feels like something watching or waiting to kill me. Even nowadays I still need it and even with it, I still feel the need to over myself with my blanket completely just to feel a little ok

Another things that's been happening for quite a while is I see shadowy figures, now I did some research and I saw that since your eyes is made of gel sort of substance it can cause blips in the corners of your eyes. But a lot of times it's something I would see right in front of me. It's usually pretty brief, but I definitely know I saw it. I've also seen white figures or disfigured things occasionally. My best friend and parents confirmed I told them this a lot when I was younger. Recently things got a little more vivid, i started by seeing walls breathing and the floor waving and flowing like water and then a day after I saw what looked like a weird camel spider type bug crawl across the floor and under my wash cart at work, now I'm in Michigan, those don't live anywhere near here. Naturally I freaked out, and backed off, then looked under my cart and nothing was there. Then the other day I was in the stall at work and I started seeing shadows dance across the door and then it changed and looked like there were several hands moving underneath the paint, I freaked out at first, but then reached out and touched it. I didn't feel anything, but I could still see them moving under the paint, not like pushing out just moving. I've also seen lights flash, a few times when I'm driving I'll see a random flash of light across the sky, it's usually pretty bright and clear, but no one else I've been with has ever seen it. And also the other day I was outside with my dad at night talking when suddenly the driveway flashed white. There were no cars or anything outside, so idk what that was. 

Another thing is I've been hearing things for a while idk when it started, but it's usually small things like my name being called out of nowhere or I'll hear a random scream. Sometimes I'd hear phrases. Like I remember hearing randomly one time, ""he's coming"", or like ""watch out"", or ""kill them"". Random things like that. It's been a little while since I've heard stuff like that. Recently it's been more like random laughing or incoherent phrase I can't quite make out or hearing someone call my name. I had asked my friend about it and he said I used to ask him if he heard something, a lot, but he would say no pretty much everytime. Same with my parents.

Something else is I feel or smell and taste things a lot. This is something that's pretty normal for me now. I'll taste random things throughout the day, but I typically just classify it as me craving whatever it is. I also will smell random things, and example is like I was at my job putting on car decals and I would randomly start smelling cinnamon rolls, and there was nothing that could smell like that anywhere and my partner didn't smell anything. I have this happen relatively consistently. Another thing is I will be sitting in my room or something like that and I'll feel something poke me or grab me and nothing will be there. I've also get a feeling where something is crawling on me or biting me or something and when I got to touch the area nothing is there, or it'll feel like things are crawling on multiple parts of me at once, that has been going on for quite a while.

There have been a couple of occasions where I'll look at something at it'll be one color, look away and look back and it'll be another color. This happened a lot at work. I work with cars and a car would be one color I'd look away and then look back and its a completely different color. Or the other day I was spraying water on a car and it turned completely blue, I stopped and started again and it was still blue, after about 30 seconds it was clear again, and no I did not have any sort of dye in the water, just soap, but the soap is white and always has been. And as that was happening my hand looked green, and or had like a green outline. I also will see random lines or flashed of colors over and around objects or people and now it's seems even just randomly I'll see a random line if color or colors in my vision or white line flashing around things. To anyone that watches Arcane its a lot like how they portray the lines and colors around Jinx when she's having a moment or something, they flashed kinda rapidly. I also noticed a while ago I have like static over my vision, almost like TV static over everything I look at, typically it fades into the background pretty easily, but if I focus on it even a little bit it looks like rain or snow and it'll swirl and make little shapes and stuff. I've never heard anyone say they've seen anything like that before so idk maybe a weird unique thing.

I consider it quite normal to have a lot of voices in my head. My head is a constant mess of information, I have a constant chatter of some times hundreds of voices in my head all talking at once, some are louder than others some are just distant chatter, and some are like yelling at me. Depends. I've gotten used to it at this point, but I'm always a having a conversation in my head, 24/7. Sometimes I'll have it outside of my head, I know I myself faces and random expressions about the conversations that people see, usually I don't know I'm doing until someone asks why I'm making certain face. I also have a very vibrant mind like to the point where I sometimes can't distinguish what happened in my head and what actually happened. There have been several occasions where I know an event or conversation happened and then when I mention to the person they have no idea what I'm talking about. Ngl that happens a little too often. Another thing that happens is I can feel, taste and smell what I think of. Even if I've never tasted, smelled or felt it. Like a lot of times it's violent stuff like I'll imagine me cutting my tongue or eyes or something like that and it will feel like a blade is being run across them, and it is so uncomfortable and hurts a lot. Same thing happens when people explain things, my mind fills in whatever blanks they don't and I can feel it with all of my senses as if it was happening to me. Which is not fun, because I have a lot of sensory issues with things already. Dreams are the same way, my dreams are hyper realistic, I can feel, touch, taste, and hear everything with perfect accuracy, it's cool and weird. It also really hurts sometimes too, like get shot or stabbed. Not a fun thing to imagine and feel, idk how accurate those feelings are, but I feel something that's unpleasant, to say the least. Even after I wake up.

I've been told a lot that I'm pretty dense and don't have a lot of emotion. I think I have a lot of emotion I just don't know how to express it. But then a situation happens where my grandma died and I felt nothing at all, no sadness or anything. It just felt like nothing happened and I kinda forgot about it, it was then that I started to really question the amount of emotion I really had. And that happened in February . For context I grew up with her for the first 5 years of my life and constantly saw her throughout the years, so yeah I even thought it was a little strange at first that I didn't really care. I also don't really get excited. My friends and family have told me that they don't think I know how to be excited or happy, most times my emotions just sit at content. I'm not happy or sad or really much of anything I'm just content with whatever. It's how I've always been since about mid to late middle school, before then I was and extremely emotional and sensitive kid, and then out if nowhere it just disappeared and I've been like this ever since. I still feel a lot of emotion it usually takes something or someone else for me to really feel it though. Depends on the situation, because I'm pretty empathetic as well. Like I get fired up and irritated or angry easily and sometimes really sad or depressed, but I don't really ever get excited or anything. Idk tbh, it's really weird. I don't even understand it myself, it makes no sense, but at the same time makes perfect sense. Idk, it's a thing

I had kinda mentioned I had a bad memory at the start, but when I say bad I mean bad. Like to the point where I will completely forget what someone told me seconds after they said it. I piss my parents off a lot because of it. I constantly forget what they said, I forget dates, events, days, why I'm in a room or area, I forget situations, memories. I even forget my thoughts a lot, I lose my train of thought so often and it seriously pisses me off. Or will hop points and topics a lot even if they have nothing in common, my brain has this magical way of relating evertlyrhing to everything. Can be a little confusing my brain can start at learning how to tie a shoe and end at have a conversation about the catacombs or some shit. Idk it's weird, and can never keep track of it. I'm used to it, but it can be confusing to some people. I think of some of the most random shit to, I've had my best friend who smokes ask me if I'm high sometimes, even though he know I don't do any sort of drugs or anything. I find it kind of funny ngl. I've also had a lot of situations, especially recently where I did something and then walk or look away and come back or look back and I didn't do it or I did something completely different. I'm also pretty clumsy as of lately I seem to hurt my self in the stupidest ways on literally everything, like my spatial awareness has depleted so hard

Idk I'm an introvert and have been for a while I don't like people at all and for a while I had social anxiety so bad I couldn't even have a conversation. That was in like 2020. That's when I had a huge period of depressive episodes that lasted about a year. After that I got pretty heavily into spirtuality and tarot and stuff like that. Which I'm pretty sure to a doctor or psychiatrist would fall under the delusion category because I do believe a lot of things that people would consider absolutely insane, but tbh I don't care. They make sense to me and science to some degree points towards enough of it for me to believe it. But I'm not really going to get into that here. I tend to disassociate a lot too, at random moments, like when talking, or even a few times while driving(no I have not gotten into am accident while this happens, I somehow go into like autopilot mode), or doing tasks or even just playing games or  anything really. It happens several times a day, for a ranged amount of times, the longest I've disassociated was probably like an hour or two, but thats because I didn't have anything or anyone to kinda snap me out of it, so I just kinda disappeared into my mind or whatever I was staring at. I'm also always tired like 24/7, no matter what, I can get and hour of sleep or 12 hours and nothing changes I'm still just as tired, and it always takes me hours onto fall asleep, anywhere between an hour to 3 or more, occasionally less. 

Another huge issue I had is feeling like people or things are staring at me. This has been an issue I've had for a while like I used to feel like my Legos or toys were staring at me when I was younger and it would make me really uncomfortable. I have a lot of anime figures in my room and still a lot of Legos, I still feel like this even today, same with my posters I guess I just go used to it, so it doesn't bother me as much, usually, but sometimes it gets really bad. And now I'm starting to feel it more with people where it feels like they're staring at me and I'll look at then and they're usually not, but when I look away again it feels like they are. Or I have an issue where if someone is talking about a person or something I immediately assume it's me unless I hear otherwise. Especially if they look at me while their talking to someone then I immediately think they're talking about regardless of the context, and it annoys me a lot, but at the same time I'm not about to just walk up and ask or anything, because that would probably be weird.

Goddamn, sorry for this essay. And I know this is not all of it, but it's the things that stand out to me the most right now. I am going to go talk to a professional about this, but I figured I'd post this here to see what you guys think and if yoyr experiences were similar or anything. I haven't been diagnosed by anyone with anything, my parents where very against seeking help or diagnosis on anything. So idk.

767,Hello. 33 now with schizophrenia. Time flies,"I found this photo of me on my first admission during my first full blown psychotic episode. I remember them giving me ativan before this picture and being restrained, but that's about it. I apparently thought mold was growing everywhere and the only place I could breathe was my parents bedroom. My dad tried to kick me out so I tried to kill him in self defense as I saw it I've been told. My mom got me in a car but I jumped out as she was driving and was trying to get hit my a car. My dad had called 911 and a sheriff saw me and tackled me on the side of the road. I don't remember hardly any of this. It seems blurry. Is that normal for people with psychotic disorders? I go through bad bouts and get stuck on things that feed into what were delusions in retrospect then I forget about it ever happening. I used to think I had too much blood in my body and it was constricting my blood flow to my brain, so I did blood letting. I don't do that now, but I have had a few other issues. I had a bad episode in 2019 about me being gangstalked at work and I think that one was the tipping point for my brain. I haven't felt the same since. I work alone now, but idk if it's making things worse. I can't talk to people in person anymore and if I do they are put off by me bc people say that I am weird.

769,should I ask my psychiatrist about schizophrenia?,"hello I am having a peculiar issue. i hope this is the place I can ask such as this. I have wanted to ask my psychiatrist if I had schizophrenia. I am not wanting diagnosis from you or believe I am anxious about developing schizophrenia. instead it is that when I am in session with her. I will be wanting to ask but instead I will be too scared to mention it. my reason for this changes and lately it has been that she already suspects it herself. she has not said so explicitly, I have only inferred it. I will feel it purposeless to mention if she already is aware. however if I can reason myself past that belief instead it will be that I will not be taken seriously. that I am a fool for even asking or thinking that I could have schizophrenia. that actually this is all some elaborate obsession that I could stop if I wanted, although it does not feel that way to me. that simply I am once more not understanding something correctly and if I did have schizophrenia I would not be aware of it as a possibility.  It quickly becomes quite terrifying in my mind and I will lose the will to ask. I know that logically there is no harm in me asking her however that thought is so weightless in comparison. I am wondering your thoughts about this. it feels perhaps I am scared to tell her. have you experienced something like this? what have you done to get past fear of asking questions? there is no harm in asking but I am feeling that I will be harmed if only emotionally.",yluy63,2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yluy63/should_i_ask_my_psychiatrist_about_schizophrenia/,schizophrenia

771,"Well, this is Fun"," After two years on meds (either owing to them, or despite them), I have gotten to the point where I am basically incapable of understanding a complex sentence, or the plot of a TV show

Tapering off of them, in the slowest and most cautious manner, has destabilized me to the point where I can't do anything at all, because I'm overtaken by a total restlessness which prevents me from focusing for more than a few seconds at a time. I literally spend all day alternating between scrolling and minute or three-long spells watching TV. My computer has been reduced to a fidget spinner, as I'm not really retaining anything, or even trying to anymore.

I guess I might go back up on meds, but living in the way that I was wasn't really living, so that's really a path to suicide. Continuing on this way would probably lead to more stupid drug use, since I am entirely incapacitated intellectually, and I risk worsening my state by continuing down that path.

I am able to work, since it's an excruciating simple job, but without any enjoyment whatsoever to be had in my free time, it hardly feels justifiable.

If it's all the meds causing this, it might or might not get better, but I don't know how long I could wait. TD can take years to resolve, so I imagine whatever changes have occurred could take that long to correct themselves.... if that's even what they are. Thankfully, I'm not psychotic, and am taking only 1.25 mg olanzapine, so I may not even need it, but all that is damp comfort, if any, since I can barely read or write.

Anyway, just rambling. I have gradually lost all of me over the years, and can barely compose a post right now. My symptoms are all negative and cognitive at this point, but to call them debilitating would be a gross understatement; not only can I not do anything, but trying is painful, as is doing nothing. The meds don't help (and likely even, to some extent, cause) the only symptoms I have, so I hate the idea of increasing the dose because I'm too much of a wimp to do nothing with all of my time, flitting from one object of 'focus' to another like a hummingbird on speed, since I was barely any better before.

I really liked the idea of living and getting better at one point, but I'm so deep in this OCD/negative symptomry hole that I've lost sight of that as a possibility. Anyway again, stuff looks bleak, and I don't know what I can do at this point. Everything gives me akathisia, not taking things gives me akathisia, and I don't know where, if anywhere, I am underneath all this. I like the idea of living, and that's what keeps me going, but it has begun to recede from view.

774,Meds,"About an hour and a half after I have taken my meds (olanzapine) the restless in my legs and arms begin. But not every day. Maybe four times a week on average. I try to move a lot, and shake it off, but it keeps coming back and it makes it impossible to sleep. I try to postpone going to bed and try to relax with a series on telly but I can’t focus because I have to move my arms and legs. So I’ve tried to take my meds later so that I might fall asleep before the restlessness comes but then the next day is ruined because I can’t get up in the morning and I end up like a zombie way into the day. 

So thing is, I don’t have a lot of symptoms at the moment and I’ve been stable for a long time. Should I ask the doctor if I can stop taking the ap. I want to because I’m struggling with this restlessness, but I’m afraid I might end up psychotic again. Changing meds is out of the picture. I’ve tried so many.

For context: I’ve been her primary caregiver for 6 years. I’m the last of 4 siblings and I do it all on my own. Aside from my one sister putting her to bed or heating up a bowl of food while I’m at work every now and again, I manage everything - finances, daily functions, HHA schedule, appointments, groceries, meal prep, medications etc. i took care of her while putting myself through college, and having my first career job. The pressure of life, the pandemic and my responsibilities made me realize I needed worklife balance. Managing stress is a big priority to me since mental health issues are in my family. 

I’ve finally come to the hard decision that I need to put her in a home and live my life, and reduce what’s on my plate but also go for what I want. I’m the first in my family to graduate college and now first to try to start my own business. I’m unmarried and no kids but I want that one day, and quite frankly, I feel like if I don’t focus on me now, I may never have it and wake up one day angry and resentful. 

I say all this to say- I feel so much guilt for doing this but I know it’s needed.

The doctor said that I scored very high for schizophrenia but he can’t diagnose me with it because I haven’t had the first psychotic break. I have experienced psychotic symptoms before. Before I was put on an AP I would see objects flying at my face, shadowy figures in my peripheral, and I had this overwhelming feeling that something was right behind me at all times. I would also feel my skin crawling and pick at it and smell paint or vomit all the time. 
The thing I’m worried about most is the idea that there is a separate line of consciousness inside me using my brain. I constantly have gruesome and disturbing thoughts that feel like they came from someone else. They’re not ideas that I would come up with. Like flashes of putting my moms body parts down a garbage disposal. My mind really scares me sometimes

The voices never said anything comprehensible though it was all gibberish, but it was like the voices in my head would have ineligible conversations. Anyone know what this is? Also during this period some weird stuff happened, like one time I head someone break into the house and it freaked me out for a good 10 seconds before I realized I was just tripping. I’d also have periods where my thoughts would sort of trail off and i’d briefly for like a minute believe that if I ate myself i’d get stronger; like i was sitting and staring at the TV when my mind suddenly went “I wonder how much Michael Jordan ate of himself to get so strong, I wonder how much more of myself i must eat to get stronger.” Or another thing i said was, “When I kill my father my mother will reward me greatly”. Yet these little occurrences would last about 30 seconds at a time.

It's also as if they are inside my body, seeing and hearing and talking from my point of view. I often believe the way they are able to do that is by people I know giving me a drink or something falls on top of my head and penetrates through my scalp and into my body. 

As I got older, the way I have these thoughts also changed. When I was younger I used to feel like they had full control over me, and anything that is did was actually them. Later that thought of being controlled disappeared and I was just being watched. Even later, I could just close my eyes to keep them from seeing things I didn't want them to see. I could also turn off their auditory device when I have conversation with my friends so they couldn't hear. Now I can control everything the foreign researchers see from my pov, landscapes, houses, people, what I do, what I eat or where I go. 

In the present I dont feel uncomfortable or afraid anymore. Maybe because I can control what they see or hear and I can portray myself ideally. But I still do feel like I need to get rid of it. (Opinion please)

I know it's stupid to think about these things, I know that there is no way in this world that people are able to control me from an unknown place, nor am I able to control what they see. I know it's not real. I'm aware of that. I dont understand myself because I keep believing it even though I know it's not real. 

I feel like it's never gonna go away. The only people I tell this about is my doctor and my boyfriend, and they both tell me it's not possible so there's nothing to worry about or believe. I know that too :( I don't know why I keep believing it either. 

How do I cope with these thoughts? And what should I do to get rid of it? Please give me some advice whether it's based on experience or not..",ykc32c,3,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/ykc32c/do_delusional_thoughts_go_away/,schizophrenia
805,Antipsychotic nasal spray for less side effects,"So I’ve been waiting a while for new news about this. Antipsychotics in nasal spray form go directly to the brain through the nerves in the nasal cavity, avoiding the body. A fraction of the normal antipsychotic dosage is required, leading to less side effects.
Last time I emailed McMasters university scientist he said they still need to go through trials and marketing(development) etc before any results are seen.
Concurrently I read about Lybalvi, a new formulation of Olanzapine with Samidorphan, that reports less weight gain. Of course this medication is more expensive than generic Olanzapine, being newer and carrying an extra active ingredient.
Does anyone have any insight into recent antipsychotic developments? What do you think about the future of schizophrenic, and mental illness treatments?",yk2u6q,8,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yk2u6q/antipsychotic_nasal_spray_for_less_side_effects/,schizophrenia

811,How to get help,"My 25 yo and moved back in with us five days ago, and we have noticed some very concerning behavior. He is obviously not well and in terrible emotional pain due to it. 

I want to help him, but he is extremely paranoid. If I encourage him to see a medical or behavioral health provider, he says no.

His behavior is becoming increasingly erratic. He stayed up all night last night taping plastic over all the windows and told us this morning that gang members have been getting in the house like cockroaches. The day before he washed every blanket in the house, saying that little white bugs are getting everywhere and burrowing into his skin. 

He needs help and I don't know what to do. Any advice would be much appreciated. 

Thank you.

Edited to add: Having mental illness myself, I know that he's not going to get help unless he's ready. But I have no experience with paranoia and hallucinations. I would never discount his experiences as unreal because to him they are--but this seems to be escalating rapidly. How do we get professionals involved if his condition keeps deteriorating and he will not seek help himself?

But after not working for a while and being on meds a long time my life feels monotonous, stagnant and boring. I have no friends, cut them all off bc they weren't good for me while ill. I live with my mom and am working on moving out with my ssdi money. Will probably find a place soon bc of some help I'm getting with my social worker. Just saying does life get boring for yall or what? How do you keep going knowing you have no career and no real life path. I get 1100 dollars from ssdi a month which is nice to have but I feel like I should be making more bc now I'm 27. I feel like this illness has slowed my life path down and made things kind of hard. I am afraid of school for some reason. I want to have drive and make more money then just an ssdi paycheck but don't want to lose the ssdi.

i went off all my meds. i dont think i have schizophrenia. but maybe i am just doing the shit everyone hates schizophrenics for doing. i dont know. it would be so much easier to figure out if i could find one psychiatrist who gives a shit about me lmao. 

&#x200B;

apparently if you have schizophrenia you cant take adderall but i did very well on adderall in 2017 (3 years before first episode psychosis) and in general stimulants are very well loved by my brain. so maybe i dont have it. i got yelled at by the person i saw last week for taking adderall even though it was prescribed to me, and it was 5 years ago. i hate most mental health care professionals i don't know why they have to suck so hard. my therapist is amazing and it'd probably be a good idea to bring this up with her but she just went on maternity leave so i have nobody right now.",yjtsnk,9,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yjtsnk/am_i_not_schizophrenic_or_am_i_just_going_full/,schizophrenia

817,Network Complexity,So I have an idea that has a bit of jargon so please bare with me. Complexity theory is a description of networks. When many nodes or particulars work together their behavior is chaotic but the overall measure of all the nodes is deterministic. This macroscale determism is a carrier wave and a cycle is a quanta of experience. This means that lower frequency larger waves allow for more integration of nodes. Neuronal ensembles (fluidly forming aggregates of neurons that are a information processing unit) act this way. Meditation has been shown to stabilize lower frequency larger waves. So I know leading up to and during my first psychotic break I felt like I was being let in on a secret or becoming enlightened. My thought is we do become aware of genuine connectivity and synchronicity but because we have not spent years practicing to stabilize larger brain waves the increased awareness of information overwhelms and eventually ruptures our concioussness (unique pattern of macro scale carrier waves) and we are  thrown into choas.,yjrtsf,6,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yjrtsf/network_complexity/,schizophrenia

823,Help TW,"       I have had hallucinations and delusions all of my life. I am not medicated and I keep having breakdowns, sometimes manic and aggressive where I laugh at everything for hours while pacing back and forth. Other times I don’t talk at all, isolate and barely move. My mother has schizophrenia so whenever I said something about hallucinations she said that it was evil spirits trying to get me and that it was normal. She said I don’t need to see anybody because it was real. My father however just thinks I have an overactive imagination and it’s nothing to worry about. Recently I’ve heard these two men in my head telling me to free them and I always feel somebody looking at me from behind(I’m guessing one of them.) They are telling me I need to free them, the only way to do that is to open my head and let them out. If I get my stepfathers shotgun and blow my head off then all three of us will be happy my school counselor wants me to go to a god damn residential mental hospital and I don’t want to go it’s almost my 1st anniversary with my gf she is the only thing that keeps me distracted from them now and I’m not going to get locked away from my only source of hope for months on end if they take me away I’m going to fucking kill my self wth do I do

829,"People who got help through school/college etc, what was it like?","[[I added the trigger warning flair because it talks about hallucinations, delusions, injuries etc. I'll change the flair if it's incorrect :)]] I've had hallucinations and delusions n paranoia for a long time now, the delusions n paranoia kinda wax n wane while the hallucinations are always there, just sometimes less noticeable than others. It wasn't until a delusion put me in hospital that my Dr's acknowledged it, and by acknowledging it they didn't ask me any details, they said its autism. They said that delusions that had gotten to the point I had to b hospitalised and on other occasions get seriously injured and have permanent scarring from those was just something that happens with autism. Never got touched on again and I've been told by them that  I'm too young for it to be anything else so it's that (I'm almost 17, this happened recently, can't remember exactly when cause my memory has gotten shit n fuzzy, but recently.) Because of this they refused to look into therapy or treatment for it too.

That is now probably going to change, as I just snapped at school today. I can't remember everything exactly, but ik something happened n I got confused n scared from the noise and speaking. They've told me it was hallucinations but I seriously don't know, I've never had auditory hallucinations that were so clear, realistic and just loud. I could make out individual voices, normsy I can't. I was scared, because I didn't know what was going on. They said there wasn't anyone else there but I if I believe them because of just, it was way too real. It ended up escalating and were going to call the police for assistance because I ended up just in a ball on the floor covering my ears crying and wouldn't wouldn't in the car to go home. 

After some very tearful sentences and alot of miscommunications, the teacher with me eventually found out about what I mentioned at the beginning about the Dr's. I then told them that my case worker didn't believe me and refused to contact anyone for me about it and had told my new case worker that I'd made it up.
Teacher was pissed, seriously pissed and almost immediately called up my case worker and started talking to her. The principal came out and was annoyed and started trying to push me (he didn't know the situation, he basically just got radioed message like ""hey btw there's a student freaking out in the carpark and won't go in the car, might need police. Have fun explaining that to the inspectors"") to get me to move which scared the fuck out of me and I completely shut down at that point while yelling at him to not hurt me because I thought he was tryna kill me or some shit. After that he wasn't so annoyed n got concerned cause he realised what was going on.

I got a text from the school about an hour ago, the principal is meeting me tomorrow morning to talk about what they can help with. Idk what they're gonna do, they might take me out of the school, set up a system for me, pressure my Dr's to allow therapists to come in, I have no clue.  anyone who's been in similar situation where school has had to step in after having a breakdown, I'd really appreciate knowing what kinda happened. I'm already confused and scared, and now I don't know what's going to happen at school.

My doctor talked about clozapine, but I’m worried about the side effects. I’ve heard they’re terrible on clozapine. Does anyone have experience with clozapine? Also what meds are you on and are they helpful? I’ve tried quite a lot of meds, and I don’t like the way they make me feel, but I don’t like psychosis either",yii9kz,11,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yii9kz/what_meds_do_you_take_and_are_they_helpful/,schizophrenia
849,Question about delusions,"So my psychiatrist said that most people with schizophrenia will over time establish the idea that their delusions are indeed delusions and nothing more. She said it takes me longer than most people to figure out I am delusional.

Is this true? I thought that the whole thing about delusions is that you don't know that they're delusions.

Can someone give their two cents?",yidrsm,17,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yidrsm/question_about_delusions/,schizophrenia

852,5 Days Until My Appointment,"My brain is trying to convince me that I'm better despite all the hallucinations, despite the derealization, despite the moments where I believe I'm already dead and a corpse walking around. Despite the fact that time isn't real anymore. My brain is trying to tell me that I'm okay and that I haven't had symptoms in days so I must be better. Those ""days"" are lies, it's only been a few hours. I'm struggling to remind myself I'm still doing poorly. My brain wants so bad to believe I'm okay.",yii383,8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yii383/5_days_until_my_appointment/,schizophrenia
853,I Keep Seeing Closed Eye Hallucinations Of The Environments I’m In. Are Closed Eye Hallucinations Related To Schizophrenia/Psychosis?,"I’ve been constantly seeing closed eye hallucinations of my own home. Since last year I’ve developed these images in my mind and vision after a traumatic experience where there was theft in my neighborhood and it cause me to be too worried to the point where I’d get these images. Every time I close my eyes I dint see pitch black but I start to see static and sometimes floaters in the background. I’ll start to see the outline of afterimages with bright colors of the environments I’m in. I’ll see in full detail the inside and outside I f my house like the driveway, porch, living room, kitchen, bedrooms, and backyard. I’ll be for example in my room but when I close my eyes the hallucinations make me think I’m in the living room etc and I can see all those details around me. If the tv is on also and I close my eyes I can still see what’s on the tv even when I’m not looking at it as it predicts the images like in real time. I still get these closed eye hallucinations every day and it’s exhausting. It’s causing me to struggle with sleep and with struggling with focusing on school and helping family. I’m not sure if these closed eye hallucinations I’m describing are related to schizophrenia or psychosis but it’s concerning.",yim2sy,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yim2sy/i_keep_seeing_closed_eye_hallucinations_of_the/,schizophrenia

861,Some days I just get stuck in my head and can't escape...,"I have work in the morning but I am struggling to fall asleep because I'm still stuck in my head, been stuck all day. 

It's almost like a trance or like the feeling of zoming out. Except you are still completely aware and functioning through the motions of life...but also, ieverything just feels weird, foreign, surreal...

This happens more frequently than I would like...but it seems to be happening more these days. It is so difficult to deal with...makes things so hard to concentrate, focus, process, etc...all while making the hallucinations, voices, thoughts, delusions, etc more impactful...

Sigh...

I wish I had someone to talk to  but I am alone in my mind...

869,my meds stopped working. I can't do another 60 years of this,"I had a year of hell of off and on again psychosis. Then I went on 17.5 my of olanazpine and the symptoms totally went away. Leading up to last week I'd get a return of symptoms for max 20 min every few weeks. Then last week suddenly my delusion that everybody can hear my thoughts came back as well as belief the world is about to end in the next few years.

On top of this about 3 weeks ago I started seeing flashes of light and blue orbs. I've never had visual or audible hallucinations. I think they are spirits, unsure if good or evil. I got my eyes checked as first I thought I had an eye problem but the basic eye exam returned nothing. 

I did ""hear"" voices before. They were not audible, but rather an inner monologue I talked to that I thought was a separate entity. This time its nowhere near as intense but unlike last time where they were quite friendly and neutral these new voices are pure evil even if its not an all day dialogue like it was last time. Sometimes I identity this entity is really just my ownbless savoury thoughts and self hatred and I realise I'm the one thinking it but it's getting harder to distinguish. 

During my last few episodes I was quite manic. Now im just drained physically and mentally. I'm so tired. I'm now afraid to pursue my passion  of essay writing because I'm afraid if I do I'll become to antichrist and put at risk my salvation (I'm a universalist Christian, but the voices make it seem like God is angry with me when God from my experiance is all loving) the biggest fear is that I'll lead myself or others to hell if I don't resign myself to a life of quiet poverty.

This has happened at the worst possible time, a month into my first year of community college (that leads on to univeristy) after I decided to get an education because I thought I'd fully recovered.

I'm just so tired and scared. I can't do 60 more years of this (I'm 22) I pray every day to get brain cancer to just make this stop. I was feeling the best I'd ever been right before this episode. I found total comfort in trusting in God, writing and gratitude for what I have in life, gratitude towards friends, family, God and my recovery and now its all gone I feel distanced from God and going out in public makes my symptoms worse.",yhnjc1,18,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/yhnjc1/my_meds_stopped_working_i_cant_do_another_60/,schizophrenia
