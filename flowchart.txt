Flow Chart
===========

Scarping the Dataset
=====================

1. Registering to Reddit API 
2. Creating the APP for Client Id and Client Secret
3. Using Reddit API for scarping the comment/ post relating to Schizophrenia and non - Schizophrenia
4. Importing the Package
5. Appending the Client Secret and ID to the variable
6. Delcaring the type of sb-reddit comment
7. Scarping the hot post 
8. Appending the post to different variable
9. Saving the dataframe to CSV

Analysis and Classification
============================

1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset 
	- Mergeing All Dataset as one data 
3. Data processing
4. Visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
5. Feature Selection 
	- Count Vectorizer
	- LIWC
	- Keras Tokenizer
7. Splitting the data to train and test
8. Building the model - Machine Learning
	- Random Forest
	- Support Vector MAchine
	- Logistic Regression
	- Naive Bayes
	- Voting Classifier
	- Stacking Classifier - Boosting Ensemble
	- DNN
	- CNN
	- LSTM
	- GNN backbone of GRU
	- CNN + LSTM
10. Training the model
11. Building the model with Voting Classifier gives better accuracy
12. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
13. Importing the packages
14. Exploring the dataset 
15. Data processing
16. User gives input
17. The given input is translated and preprocessed for prediction
18. Trained model is used for prediction
19. Final outcome is displayed through frontend

Extension -  Voting Classifier, Stacking Classifier and CNN + LSTM used as extension with proposed one 
from which Voting Classifer gives better accuracy is used to build the ,model and save it from user prediction
